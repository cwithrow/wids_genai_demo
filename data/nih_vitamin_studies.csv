Her short-term goal is to develop the knowledge and skills to conduct metabolic research using stable isotope methods. Her long-term goal is to become an independent investigator studying nutritional and metabolic aspects of critical illness and lung disease. Dr. Kao is enrolled in the MS track of the Clinical Scientist Training Program at BCM, and she has access to the extensive resources of the Texas Medical Center, including the Children's Nutrition Research Center and a multi-hospital system. Dr. Kao will examine the metabolic relationship between glutamine and arginine. These amino acids are linked by an inter-organ pathway involving intestinal conversion of glutamine to citrulline followed by renal uptake of citrulline and conversion to arginine. She proposes that, in septic patients, (a) alterations in the availability and whole-body and splanchnic metabolism of glutamine will lead to decreased synthesis of citrulline and arginine and (b) glutamine supplementation will elicit an increase in citrulline, and hence arginine, synthesis. Stable isotope tracer methods will be used to test specific aspects of these hypotheses. Specific aim 1 will determine differences in the rate of glutamine conversion to citrulline and the fractional splanchnic extraction of glutamine in septic patients and healthy controls. The hypothesis is that septic patients have decreased citrulline synthesis from glutamine, and that the rate of citrulline production is directly related to the rate of splanchnic extraction of glutamine. Specific aim 2 will determine the rate of de novo arginine synthesis from its precursors, citrulline and glutamine, in septic patients and healthy controls. The hypothesis is that decreased glutamine availability leads to decreased de novo arginine synthesis in septic patients. Specific aim 3 will determine the effects of enteral and parenteral glutamine supplementation on arginine and citrulline synthesis in septic patients. The hypothesis is that glutamine supplementation of septic patients will lead to increased citrulline and de novo arginine synthesis, and the magnitude of this increase will be greater with enteral compared to parenteral supplementation.   ","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Two compounds, arginine and glutamine, help our body fight severe infections. This research will help to better define the relationship between these two compounds and will determine if supplying more of one (glutamine) will in turn lead to increases in the other (arginine). Better understanding of the body's utilization of these two compounds can contribute to improved nutritional therapy in patients with severe infection.      ",

But during this life-cycle stage children living in poverty are often vulnerable to negative influences including malnutrition, illnesses, an un-stimulating environments, possibly preventing them from reaching their full potential and perpetuating poverty across generations. Small-scale studies have demonstrated that offering stimulation and nutrition to young children can have positive effects on short and long-term outcomes, such as cognition, self-esteem, depression and other important measures. However it has not yet been demonstrated that these interventions can be scaled-up to form the basis of sustainable and effective policy towards child development. The project will introduce a stimulation program, coupled with micronutrient supplementation, to improve interactions between mothers and their young children with the aim of achieving better child outcomes. The program will follow a systematic weekly curriculum based on the natural developmental stages of the child. It will be implemented in rural communities of Odisha in India, an area where poverty and malnutrition are prevalent. It will be delivered by women from within the communities, which will have been trained for this purpose, in the following forms: (i) weekly individual home visits to the child and its main caregiver/mother, or (ii) in a suitably modified way, within the context of weekly main caregiver/mother and child group meetings. The intervention will be accompanied by an evaluation based on a randomized control trial with five variants including a control group. Data will be collected on child developmental outcomes and detailed maternal- and household-level data before the start, halfway through and at the end of the intervention. Having local women deliver the intervention is key to designing low-cost and sustainable policies. The formation of groups could further reduce costs and enhance the dissemination of good child rearing practices. The aim is to test for effectiveness and to understand the pathways through which these interventions achieve their outcomes. As such the project relates directly to the NIH mission of applying knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce the burdens of illness. The research will be disseminated through presentations at academic conferences, to policy makers and stakeholders at specially designed meetings and will form the basis for submission to top peer-reviewed Journals such as the Lancet and the American Economic Review. Results will be posted on a dedicated website.          ","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: By identifying cost-effective and scalable early-years interventions, our research has the potential to revolutionize early childhood development (ECD) policies and contribute to breaking the intergenerational cycle of poverty. If the interventions we  propose to test prove to be successful, our findings can form a blueprint for ECD strategies that will be applicable in poor communities, based on local resources and empowerment and capable of changing the developmental trajectories of children in a substantive way.

In the United States, HCV is the most common chronic blood borne infection affecting 1.8% of the population and appears to be the major etiologic factor responsible for the recent doubling of HCC in the United States. Current therapy consists of pegylated interferon-1 (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV). 70% of patients in the United States are infected with genotype 1 for which sustained virologic response (SVR) is only 42-46%. Generally, therapy of all genotypes can be accompanied by adverse effects and contraindications to therapy are not infrequent. For these reasons there is the need to develop additional therapies that are less toxic and result in higher SVR either as adjuncts or replacement therapies. We have identified the heat shock proteins (HSP)s HSP40 and HSP70 in complex with the HCV encoded protein NS5A through mass spectrometric analysis. We confirmed an NS5A/HSP interaction by confocal microscopy and coimmunoprecipitation. HSP40 and HSP70 knockdown both reduced infectious viral particle production in a HCV cell culture system. Treatment with the heat shock protein synthesis inhibitors Quercetin and KNK437 reduced infectious particle production at non-toxic concentrations. This striking inhibition of virus production combined with its known low toxicity and use in previous and ongoing clinical trials serves to motivate this bench to bedside proposal to study treat HCV infected patients with Quercetin. In this proposal, our goals are to further understand the impact of HSP40 and HSP70 and heat shock protein synthesis inhibitors on HCV infection and determine Quercetin's safety and antiviral activity in patients suffering from chronic HCV infection in a phase I clinical trial. To achieve this we propose three interrelated specific aims: 1. We will determine the importance of heat shock proteins 40 and 70 in hepatitis C virus production in the HCVcc model. 2. We will determine the impact of heat shock protein synthesis inhibitors on hepatitis C viral infection in the HCVcc model. We will test the clinical feasibility of the heat shock protein synthesis inhibitor Quercetin on patients with chronic hepatitis C viral infection through a phase I trial. Further understanding of heat shock proteins and heat shock protein synthesis inhibition in HCV infection may allow for successful treatment of chronic hepatitis C and reduce the incidence of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.      ","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic hepatitis C viral (HCV) infection is the number one causative agent of cirrhosis necessitating liver transplantation and is the major cause of the recent doubling of hepatocellular carcinoma in the United States.

Each blood donation removes 200 to 250 mg of iron from the donor. Consequently, many donors become iron deficient with repeated donation. This presents a challenge to blood centers that has become more acute in recent years with the realization that iron deficiency even in the absence of anemia is associated with adverse effects including fatigue and decreased exercise tolerance, as well as neurological symptoms such as decreased cognitive function, pica and restless leg syndrome. REDS-II (NHLBI Retrovirus Epidemiology Donor Study-II) is a consortium of 6 blood centers located across the United States. REDS-II investigators performed a longitudinal study investigating the iron status of blood donors over a two year period called the REDS-II Donor Iron Status Evaluation (RISE). Results from the baseline analysis of regular donors (e 2 donations per year (females) or e 3 donations per year (males) revealed that over two-thirds of female donors and over one-half of male donors have iron deficiency. To both safeguard donor health and prevent the loss of committed blood donors, the time has come for blood centers to address this problem of donor iron deficiency. Here we propose to utilize a consortium of three of the REDS-II blood centers to assess potential interventions that will prevent/mitigate iron deficiency in blood donors. Subjects for the proposed studies will be recruited from RISE donors. The availability of these donors whose iron status is well studied for two years in RISE will allow us to assess changes in laboratory data, donation experience and donor symptoms over a combined 4-year period between the two studies. In Specific Aim 1 we will determine if providing donors with accurate information about their iron status and appropriate courses of action, such as prolonging donation intervals or taking iron supplements, will influence them to take independent steps to improve their iron status. In Specific Aim 2 we will provide donors with a 60-day supply of multiple vitamins formulated with 38, 19 or 0 mg of elemental iron to take following each blood donation. The primary outcome for both Specific Aims is to determine how the interventions change donor iron status as assessed by measurement of plasma ferritin, plasma soluble transferrin receptor and reticulocyte hemoglobin content. Secondary outcomes are to determine how the interventions change the proportion of donor visits resulting in successful collection of a unit of blood and how they change the proportion of donor visits resulting in low hematocrit deferral. Tertiary outcomes are to determine how the interventions change the prevalence of donor fatigue, pica and restless leg syndrome as assessed by a survey administered at the beginning and end of the study. Findings from the proposed studies will provide important information on the efficacy of various approaches for iron replacement in blood donors and lay the groundwork for effective programs that can be readily implemented by community blood centers."," Narrative Whole blood donation removes iron from the donor and can result in iron deficiency following repeated donation. The primary objective of the proposed studies is to develop programs that will prevent/mitigate iron deficiency in regular blood donors. This will contribute to improved public health by preventing the adverse consequences of iron deficiency in blood donors such as fatigue and decreased exercise tolerance, as well as neurological symptoms such as decreased cognitive function, pica and restless leg syndrome.",
"5","R01","HL102122-04","Effect of Vitamin D and Omega-3 Fatty Acids on Blood Pressure and Hypertension","","30-Nov-2015","FORMAN, JOHN P; SESSO, HOWARD D","UNITED STATES","626195","2015","HL","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The human toll of hypertension (HTN) is staggering, and effective preventive measures are needed. Experimental studies suggest that inadequate vitamin D and I-3 fatty acid (FA) levels may be involved in the pathogenesis of HTN through multiple biological mechanisms. Observational studies have shown inverse associations of plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels and dietary I-3 FA intake with blood pressure (BP) and HTN. Small intervention trials of vitamin D and fish oil rich in I-3 FA suggest possible BP-lowering effects; however, larger trials using adequately high doses of vitamin D and I-3 FA for the primary prevention of HTN are lacking. The VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL), an NIH-supported, large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2x2 factorial trial, will test 2000 IU/day of vitamin D (as vitamin D3 [cholecalciferol]) and 1 g/day of marine I-3 FA (eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] + docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) supplements on incident cardiovascular disease and cancer in 20,000 multiethnic men and women with 5 years of treatment and follow-up. VITAL provides an optimal cost-effective setting to examine the effects of both interventions on changes in BP and incident HTN. Further, as this project would begin in parallel with enrollment into the parent VITAL trial, pre-randomization assessments of BP and biomarkers will be possible. In this proposed ancillary study, we will recruit a representative subcohort of 1,000 VITAL participants without baseline HTN from 5 major US metropolitan areas to conduct home-based examinations at baseline and 2 years follow-up through Examination Management Services, Inc (EMSI). We will obtain 24-hour ambulatory BP (ABP), fasting bloods, 24-hour urines, and other clinical assessments in this EMSI subcohort. We will also ascertain incident HTN cases in the overall VITAL trial. We will test the following hypotheses: (1) whether vitamin D and fish oil supplementation lowers 24-hour ABP compared to placebo in the EMSI subcohort of 1,000 participants; (2) whether vitamin D and fish oil supplementation reduces the risk of incident HTN compared to placebo among all randomized VITAL participants without baseline HTN; and (3) whether vitamin D and fish oil supplementation favorably changes HTN-related biomarkers that are putative mechanistic mediators linking vitamin D and I-3 FAs with HTN compared to placebo. This proposed study will provide definitive evidence to support or refute the potential preventive roles of vitamin D and I-3 FA on BP and the development of HTN.      ","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prior research suggests that vitamin D and fish oil (which contains nutrients called omega-3 fatty acids) might help lower blood pressure and prevent hypertension; however, this remains unproven because large and more definitive research studies have not been done. This proposed study will be a large-scale and long-term randomized trial that will demonstrate whether taking vitamin D or fish oil supplements can lower someone's blood pressure or prevent the development of hypertension. Because high blood pressure is responsible for one out of every six deaths in the United States, the results of this study could possibly improve the health of many people.         ",

Vitamin D deficiency is widespread among HIV-infected adults and children. This is particularly alarming since there is a higher risk than the general population for complications like osteoporosis, non-AIDS-defining malignancies, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) - all diseases associated with vitamin D deficiency. It is not known how much vitamin D deficiency heightens the risk of complications like CVD, affects immune function and disease progression, or interferes with optimal treatment in the HIV population. The impact of vitamin D deficiency in the HIV population may be compounded even further since the etiology of HIV-related complications like CVD is thought to be related in part to inflammation and detrimental endothelial effects associated with chronic HIV infection-similar proposed mechanisms as vitamin D deficiency. Data suggest that optimal vitamin D status may be protective against these HIV-related complications, and optimizing vitamin D status with oral supplementation in HIV-infected individuals may improve the risk of HIV-related complications by decreasing inflammation and/or improving endothelial dysfunction, and may improve immune function even in individuals on antiretroviral therapy. Developing suitable repletion strategies is crucial to maximizing health status, particularly in HIV-infected children and young adults, where an opportunity exists for disease prevention. However, the best method of vitamin D repletion is not known, and data suggest that some antiretroviral medications interfere with vitamin D metabolism. Thus, we hypothesize that (1) optimizing vitamin D status to the current Institute of Medicine's (IOM) suggested 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration of e20 ng/mL improves CVD risk, inflammation, and CD4 cell counts in HIV-infected individuals, (2) increasing 25(OH)D concentrations to >30 ng/mL improves CVD risk and inflammation to a greater degree than increasing eto 20 ng/mL (the concentration some experts consider optimal for cardiovascular health), and (3) a 'high dose' of oral vitamin D is necessary to achieve 25(OH)D concentrations >30 ng/mL. These hypotheses will be addressed by determining the longitudinal relationships between serum 25(OH)D concentrations, carotid intima-media thickness, pulse wave velocity, pro-inflammatory biomarkers, and CD4 cell counts in HIV-infected children and young adults in a double-blinded, randomized-controlled trial of three different vitamin D dosing regimens given over 24 months in HIV-infected children and young adults (ages 10-25 years) with vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D <20 ng/mL). We will also evaluate the 25(OH)D concentrations from each arm after 6, 12, and 24 months of supplementation, in order to determine a dose-response relationship. These findings could have a sizable impact on health in this population, since vitamin D therapy is inexpensive and associated with few adverse side effects. The PI is an exceptional candidate who is a pediatric infectious diseases specialist with a proven research focus in the metabolic and cardiovascular complications of HIV. She is mentored by a committed, multidisciplinary team of senior investigators with extensive experience in both mentoring and in the research methodologies relevant to this proposal. Future training in all aspects of clinical research, cardiovascular disease risk assessment, and clinical nutrition is planned to facilitate the PI's development into a successful independent physician scientist.        "," In most studies, HIV-infected individuals have a higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency compared to uninfected individuals. Vitamin D deficiency may contribute to some of the long-term complications of HIV infection, such as cardiovascular disease and increased inflammation. This proposal will advance our understanding of whether correction of vitamin D deficiency affects the risk of these HIV-related complications and/or improves CD4 cell counts.                    ",

Therefore, vitamin D replenishment in vitamin D-deficient obese and overweight children has the potential to improve their cardiometabolic health and reduce their risk of CVD later in life. In this proposa, we will test the central hypothesis that enhancement of vitamin D status in such children will improve their vascular health and their CVD and metabolic syndrome risk profile. Our primary objective is to determine, in obese and overweight children aged 10 to 18 years with vitamin D deficiency (defined as serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <20 ng/mL), the efficacy of enhanced vitamin D3 supplementation in improving vascular endothelial function, arterial stiffness, insulin sensitivity, and metabolic syndrome risk status; and to assess whether these effects are dose- dependent. As a secondary objective, we will examine the vitamin D supplementation-induced effect on adipokines and inflammatory markers relevant to CVD risk. In a double-masked, controlled trial, we will randomize 252 eligible children to receive either 600 IU (conventional supplementation), or 1000 IU or 2000 IU (enhanced supplementation) of vitamin D3 daily for 6 months. Study outcome measures, assessed at baseline, 3 and 6 months, will include (1) brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) as a measure of vascular endothelial function; (2) pulse wave velocity as a measure of arterial stiffness; (3) surrogate estimates of insulin sensitivity (fasting glucose/fasting insulin ratio or Homeostasis Model of Assessment - Insulin Resistance [HOMA-IR]); (4) metabolic syndrome risk factors (blood pressure, waist circumference, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and fasting blood glucose); (5) inflammatory markers (e.g. CRP, IL-6, TNF-alpha); (6) adipokines (leptin and adiponectin); and (7) nitric oxide metabolites.

Total body fat will be ascertained by Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry to examine the confounding effects of adiposity on outcome measures. Innovative aspects of this proposal include (1) characterizing the temporal changes in vascular health and cardiometabolic risk outcomes in response to enhancement of vitamin D status in a population of children at high-risk for vascular dysfunction and cardiometabolic risks; and (2) delineating the vitamin D effects on inflammatory markers and adipokines relevant to CVD risk.

The knowledge generated by the experiments in this application will be crucial to translation of this inexpensive, easily-accessible potential therapy for asthma. __SpecificAimsTextDelimiter__  5.5.2. Specific Aims  Asthma has become considerably more prevalent and severe in the U.S. during the last 40 years, particularly affecting youth in urban areas, yet the reasons for this are not clear.1,2 There is increasing evidence that vitamin D insufficiency contributes to more severe asthma through increased risk of respiratory infections3- 7 and decreased sensitivity to glucocorticoids.8,9 Indeed, low vitamin D levels are linked with the need for exogenous glucocorticoids and increased asthma severity.9-12 Particularly relevant to health disparities, we showed a strong association between vitamin D insufficiency and asthma in urban African American (AA) youth.13 Importantly, AA youth in ours and other studies had lower vitamin D levels than non-AA participants.14  Because AA youth residing in urban Washington, DC have markedly worse asthma than other racial/ethnic groups (e.g. prevalence rate 20% higher than the national rate 15 and emergency department utilization rates up to 5 times the national rates and nearly 10 times the Healthy People 2010 target rate), we will utilize our access to this population at the extreme of asthma disparities to examine the contribution of vitamin D to disparities in the chronic control and acute severity of asthma. The overall goal of this application for a NIMHD Health Disparities Research R01 is to provide critical epidemiological/molecular information that will inform the interpretation of ongoing and impending randomized clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation in asthma, especially with regard to urban AA youth with asthma. We hypothesize that low serum 25- hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels are associated with poor chronic asthma control, worse acute asthma severity, and glucocorticoid insensitivity. The knowledge generated by the experiments in this application will be crucial to translation of this inexpensive, easily-accessible, and thereby potentially disparity- reducing prospective therapy for asthma.  AIM 1. Define asthma phenotypic clusters and determine cross-sectional inter- and intra-cluster associations with serum 25(OH)D levels within and between AA and non-AA youth. In this aim, we will reduce asthma phenotypic heterogeneity, an important obstacle in asthma research, through novel statistical clustering techniques that we previously published.16 We showed that this technique permits detection of otherwise unrecognized associations between environmental factors and asthma. We expect these same clustering methods in a cohort of 500 urban youth of all races/ethnicities will define the cross-sectional relationship between phenotypic clusters (at enrollment) and circulating 25(OH)D (at enrollment), along with intra-cluster baseline chronic and acute severity measures, within and between races/ethnicities.  AIM 2. Determine prospective associations among serum 25(OH)D levels and: (a) chronic asthma control and (b) acute asthma severity within and between AA and non-AA youth. Chronic asthma control and acute asthma severity will be assessed prospectively in the same cohort of 500 youth at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months following the baseline encounter in AIM 1. We will use regression modeling to examine the association between serum 25(OH)D (sampled at enrollment and 6 months) and chronic asthma control and acute asthma severity during each ensuing 6 month period while correcting for baseline chronic asthma severity. Although we intend to analyze the entire cohort within and between races/ethnicities, our Preliminary Results suggest that the most productive analyses for this aim will be within-cluster associations observed after we stratify by the phenotypic asthma clusters defined in AIM 1 in the AA youth.  AIM 3. Show the effect of vitamin D on glucorticoid regulation of inflammatory mediators in asthmatic airway epithelial cells. We recently showed that primary asthmatic airway epithelia (a site of clinical glucocorticoid administration and key lung tissue in asthma17-19) are intrinsically inflammatory and that key secreted inflammatory cytokines are suppressed by glucocorticoid exposure.20 We will test for interaction between vitamin D and glucocorticoids in ex vivo nasal epithelial cells (an accepted in vitro surrogate for bronchial epithelium21) from all 500 participants at the baseline and 6 month visits. These cells will be cultured before and after a 4h exposure to dexamethasone (0, 20, 100nM) and/or 1,25(OH2)D (0, 10nM). Expression of key glucocorticoid-regulated inflammatory mRNAs and proteins (e.g. for MAP kinase phosphatase [MKP]-1, interleukin [IL]-10, IL-1�, and transforming growth factor [TGF]-�1) will be compared according to the participant's serum 25(OH)D and ex vivo 1,25(OH2)D dose, overall and within phenotypic clusters from AIM 1. We expect these experiments to show differences in 'sensitivity' to vitamin D according to cluster (i.e. 'type of asthma') and define race/ethnicity differences in glucocorticoid response.  Impact: The proposed studies will provide novel generalizable insights into the contribution of vitamin D to disparities in the chronic control and acute severity of urban asthma. The primary goal of this proposal is to address epidemiologic and mechanistic cellular/molecular questions that will inform asthma intervention trials (i.e. vitamin D supplementation) especially with regard to urban AA youth with asthma. We believe there are important unanswered questions concerning the role of vitamin D in disparities in asthma care and outcomes and the experiments proposed in this application would generate valuable information in that regard.

Briefly, we wil enroll 4000 adult men and non-pregnant women who are starting ART within the Management and Development for Health (MDH) President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) treatment program in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania. Individuals who consent for enrollment in the trial will be randomized to receive an oral supplement regimen of one of two groups: (a) vitamin D3 oral supplements containing 50,000 IU taken weekly at clinic visits for 4 weeks (weeks 0, 1, 2, 3) followed by maintenance 2,000 IU oral supplements taken daily at home for the remaining trial duration (week 4 and continued through 1 year) or (b) placebo supplements taken weekly at clinic visits for 4 weeks (weeks 0, 1, 2, 3) followed by placebo oral supplements taken daily at home for the remaining trial duration (week 4 and continued through 1 year). We will then follow study participants for 1 year at monthly clinic and home visits to assess our two primary trial endpoints: (a) death and (b) incident pulmonary tuberculosis. Secondarily, we will also assess the effect of vitamin D3 on (i) CD4 T-cell counts, (ii) incidence of comorbidities and complications associated with HIV and/or ART, (iii) markers of bone health in blood, and (iv) weight gain. Evidence from this randomized trial is urgently needed since ART coverage is rapidly expanding globally and treatment programs are in need of interventions to prolong and improve the quality of life for HIV-infected individuals initiating ART during the first months of treatment.

Evidence supports large heritable contributions to the etiology of ASD, though environmental factors are likely to modify both the development and the course of ASD. Prenatal nutrition and nutrient-environment interactions have been understudied in relation to autism etiology and risk. As the first researchers to examine maternal nutrition in association with autism risk, we found that mothers of children with autism were significantly less likely to report having taken prenatal vitamins around conception than mothers of typically developing (TD) children. Additionally, their estimated total folic acid intake was lower. Here it is proposed that maternal nutrient statu may contribute to the multifactorial etiology of autism by modifying susceptibility to other environmental agents. Animal studies show that folic acid supplementation can protect the fetus from environmental toxins through DNA methylation mechanisms. Thus, the overall purpose of this R21 is to examine interactions between nutrient status and environmental exposures in relation to ASD and to assess DNA methylation as a candidate mechanism for the modification of susceptibility. The focus is on two classes of environmental exposures that have been linked to increased ASD risk: traffic-related air pollution (TRP) and pesticides. Preliminary findings suggest attenuation of these associations from maternal periconceptional prenatal vitamin supplement intake. More specifically an investigation of whether two measures of folate status, maternally-reported folic acid intake and newborn bloodspot folate, act as effect modifiers for TRP and pesticides, while considering timing and dose or level of each exposure, and adjusting for confounders will be explored. Expectations here are that higher levels of folic acid before and during early pregnancy and neonate folate will reduce the risk of ASD associated with TRP and pesticide exposures in a dose-dependent manner. Further, an examination of global DNA methylation as a mechanism by which folate status may modify susceptibility to the environmental exposure effects will be tested. It is hypothesized that higher levels of folate will counter the neurodevelomentally relevant hypomethylation effects of these environmental exposures by providing abundant access to methyl-groups, (reflected in higher global DNA methylation levels in newborn bloodspots), and reducing their associated ASD risk. The proposed study will not only elucidate whether folate is able to reduce the neurodevelopmental consequences of harmful environmental exposures, but will also help reveal critical time periods and mechanisms behind potential protective effects. If the hypotheses are supported, this will be one of the first studies to identify complex relationships among modifiable risk factors for autism to be followed up in a prospective study, where we can assess timing, dose of exposures, and precise mechanisms more thoroughly.

"1","R01","HD071915","Impact of Emergency Department Probiotic Treatment of Pediatric Gastroenteritis","","30-Nov-2018","Freedman, Stephen ; Schnadower, David ","UNITED STATES","809725","2014","HD","     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is a leading cause of malnutrition and death worldwide. In the US, close to 48 million people contract AGE and 128,000 are hospitalized each year . Episodes of AGE can result in substantial morbidity to children and their families. In addition, the costs to caregivers, the health-care system, and society are significant. At present, treatment options are limited and targeted at symptom management rather than disease modification. Probiotics - live microbial cultures which, when consumed in adequate amounts, confer documented health benefits - may be an ideal solution. They are hypothesized to work via a combination of direct microbiologic and immunologic mechanisms. Probiotics have shown promise in early clinical research in hospitalized children in developing countries. These early efforts are limited by small samples, outcomes lacking relevance to outpatients, poor methodology and absence of side effect reporting; thus, the potential role of probiotics remains poorly defined and practice guidelines do not endorse their use. There are current trends, however, that obligate an urgent assessment of these agents. First, probiotic manufacturers have embarked in aggressive public marketing strategies that make health claims that may not be supported by rigorous research, and the world-wide market for probiotic products is growing steadily (projected growth 2009-2014 12.6% for a total of US $32.6 billion/year). Second, government agencies (US FDA and European Food safety Authority (EFSA)) remain concerned about their value and safety. Third, some institutions are now recommending the use of probiotics based on potentially flawed or limited evidence. Fourth, parents of patients with AGE are often medicating their children without guidance from medical professionals. We are therefore concerned that probiotic consumption is increasing without solid evidence to support its use, which underscores the necessity to conduct a definitive trial without delay. Objectives - The overall objective of this multi-national randomized clinical trial is to determine if a specific probiotic agent, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG(LGG), the most widely available, studied and regulated probiotic in the US, should routinely be administered to outpatient children who are suffering from AGE. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) to determine the clinical effectiveness of LGG and (2) to determine the safety and side effect profile of LGG in children 3-48 months of age presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with AGE. Study Setting & Design - The study will be conducted in 8 US pediatric emergency departments within the federally funded Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN). We will randomize 900 children to receive 5 days of a probiotic agent (LGG 1 x 1010 CFU twice a day) or placebo. The main outcome is the occurrence of moderate-severe disease as defined by the Modified Vesikari Score, a validated clinical severity score, which incorporates the frequency and duration of diarrhea, frequency and duration of vomiting, height of fever, need for future health-care visits and medical interventions provided. We will also assess the occurrence of adverse events and side effects related to the use of LGG. We will collect stool samples to conduct mechanism of action studies as well as economic data to conduct cost effectiveness analyses in the future. Impact - This study will directly inform clinica practice by providing the first definitive evidence to support recommendations for or against the routine use of probiotics in the treatment of pediatric AGE. In addition it will provide health-car practitioners and policy makers with (a) a clear picture on the potential side effects from probiotic use, and with the data collected (b) knowledge on the mechanism of action and (c) of the potential economic impact of probiotic use on health-care systems and society. Thus, the potential clinical and societal impacts of the proposed study are substantial and the results will guide the standard of care: if positive, guidelines will be able to endorse probiotic administratio with important positive consequences for the health of several million US children annually. Moreover, if beneficial the cost savings to the health-care system and society may be substantial. If the results are negative, a firm recommendation against the routine use of probiotics would be justified. Collaborators - This work is collaboration between leaders in multicenter and AGE research (Schnadower, Freedman, Tarr, Gorelick, Mahajan, Stanley, Roskind, Powell, O'Connel, Ruddy Chun, Levine and Casper) in prestigious Children's Hospitals within a federally funded multicenter network (PECARN) with a strong record in conducting high quality, high impact clinical trials.          ","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Gastroenteritis, or intestinal infection, which usually manifests as vomiting and diarrhea, is one of the most common illnesses of childhood. It causes over 1.7 million deaths per year worldwide. In the United States, it is rarely fatal, however it results in .4 million doctor visits and 128,000 hospitalizations per year and constitutes a significant burden for patients, their families and society. Currently, available treatments for this condition are aimed only at the symptoms and complications (e.g. dehydration) and not at modifying the disease process. We propose to study the effectiveness and side effects of a probiotic, LGG, in treating children with gastroenteritis. If successful, this therapeutic intervention would be the frst treatment that actually changes the disease process and would represent an enormous public health advance both in the US, and potentially, globally.

Proline is a neuromodulator at glutamatergic synapses, and the peripheral hyperprolinemia arising from PRODH mutations or CNVs encompassing PRODH, has been associated with cognitive impairment and decreased IQ. We recently reported a highly significant association of hyperprolinemia with SZ. We now provide evidence that two further independent SZ risk factors: Low vitamin-D status, and mutation of the dysbindin gene (Dtnbp1), also cause hyperprolinemia. Our findings suggest convergence of the biological pathways regulated by vitamin-D and DTNBP1, via loss of PRODH expression, with elevated proline as a common SZ endophenotype. Studies have documented the dysfunctional consequences of hyperprolinemia, such as aberrant glutamatergic and dopamine signaling leading to, for example, cognitive deficits and attenuated prepulse inhibition (PPI). Targeting hyperprolinemia in the Dtnbp1 model may therefore positively impact neurotransmitter signaling and restore function. This proposed study is designed to test our hypotheses under the following Specific Aims. Aim 1: To test the relative molecular contributions of low Vitamin D, and PRODH, and DTNBP1 gene variants, to SZ- associated hyperprolinemia.

A major breakthrough for prevention and cure has been the appreciation that breast cancer is not one disease, rather a collection of cancer subtypes becoming better defined by improved methodologies based upon histopathologic, genetic and molecular signatures. Over time we have applied histological type, grade, tumor size, lymph-node involvement, and estrogen receptor (ER) and HER-2/neu receptor status to help define prognosis and probability of response to therapies, yet these alone have not fully captured the varied behavior of breast cancer. The field is now rapidly progressing with gene expression and proteomic signatures that will help 'personalize' our interventions for individuals. This same concept is relevant to interventions for primary or secondary prevention and is the focus of our translational grant application. Our pre-clinical studies have demonstrated a strong benefit for dietary -3 fatty acid rich fish oil for the inhibition of ERPR(-)HER-2/neu(+) mammary tumors in a transgenic mouse model showing decreased tumor incidence, multiplicity and glandular atypia. Thus, our central hypothesis is that the development of aggressive breast cancer sub-types such as of ERPR(-)HER-2/neu(+) or ERPR(-)HER-2/neu(-) (i.e. triple negative) disease may be uniquely responsive to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), the long chain -3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) found in fish oil. As a first step towards a future definitive prevention trial in women, we propose to test the efficacy of an -3 rich fish oil supplement to modulate breast biomarkers indicative of anti-carcinogenic action. We will randomize high risk survivors to a placebo-low dose or high dose -3 rich fish oil capsule treatment and employ our breast fine needle aspiration techniques to obtain cells and tissue for analysis of biomarkers of exposure and efficacy. Our multidisciplinary team has developed the following Specific Aims to: (1) Determine the effects of dietary -3 fatty acids on biomarkers of exposure and response in women at high risk for recurrent estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor breast cancer +/- HER-2/neu overexpression; and (2) Define the role of dietary -3 PUFAs in the epigenetic regulation of the inflammatory responses underlying mammary carcinogenesis as a novel mechanism for the effects of -3 PUFAs. Development of these biomarkers of -3 PUFA exposure and response will enable the assessment of this bioactive food component in future large-scale prevention trials for women at risk for recurrence of ERPR(-)HER-2/neu(+) or triple negative breast cancer.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The genetic and molecular heterogeneity of breast cancer accounts for wide variability in clinical response and outcome and thus mandates the development of innovative targeted therapies and prevention strategies. The unresolved role of dietary fat content and specifically ?-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in human breast carcinogenesis, despite compelling pre-clinical studies, raises the possibility that response to dietary fat depends on critical nutrient-gene interactions that may vary between subjects and/or breast cancer subtypes. This study aims to determine the effects of dietary ?-3 fatty acids on biomarkers of exposure and response in women at high risk for recurrent estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor negative breast cancer +/- HER- 2/neu overexpression and their role in the epigenetic regulation of the inflammatory responses underlying mammary carcinogenesis.

ADT is associated with a 5- to 10-fold greater loss of bone mineral density (BMD), a 7-fold increase in bone fractures, and a significant increase in sarcopenia (muscle mass atrophy) compared to age-matched prostate cancer patients not on ADT and men without cancer. The loss of BMD and muscle mass is associated with a high prevalence of physical deficits such as falls, reduced muscular strength, and decreased balance. Despite the high prevalence of ADT-related side effects, treatment options are limited. Bisphosphonate therapy is an effective treatment for ADT-induced bone loss, but is not indicated for the prevention of bone loss. Vitamin D protects against BMD loss and fractures, but its effects are strongly dose-dependent. Current IOM recommended supplementation (600 IU/day) and serum 25-OH levels (20 ng/mL) are inadequate to protect against bone loss in a high risk population such as prostate cancer patients on ADT, as evidenced by increased BMD with serum 25-OH vitamin D levels e32 ng/mL. In addition, RCT interventions of 400-500 IU/day of vitamin D failed to prevent ADT-induced bone loss. High-dose vitamin D supplementation (e.g., 50,000 IU/week) is a promising intervention that significantly increases 25-OH vitamin D to levels shown to improve BMD. Vitamin D has also been shown to increase muscular strength, reduce falls, and improve balance. Preliminary data from our group in 190 cancer patients demonstrates high-dose vitamin D supplementation (e50,000 IU/week) for 6 months in prostate cancer patients receiving treatment (e.g., ADT,                chemotherapy) is safe and well-tolerated. Other preliminary data from our group also show high-dose vitamin D supplementation (50,000 IU/week) in cancer patients significantly increases 25-OH vitamin D levels while low-dose vitamin supplementation (7,000 IU/week) does not. Based on biological plausibility and our preliminary data, we propose to conduct a two-arm randomized controlled trial in which 76 prostate cancer patients 65 years old and older on ADT will be randomized to receive 1) 50,000 IU/week vitamin D or 2) a matching placebo. All participants will receive a daily multivitamin (600 IU vitamin D) and a 1,000 mg/day calcium supplement to ensure a minimum of 100% RDA. The primary aim will evaluate the effect of high-dose vitamin D supplementation on BMD, while the secondary aims will evaluate the effect of high-dose vitamin D supplementation on muscle mass, falls, muscle strength, and physical performance. The study proposed herein is designed to provide critical preliminary information and data to inform an anticipated R01 proposal. This study would represent one of first clinical trials to examine the effect of high-dose vitamin D supplementation on ADT-related side effects in older prostate cancer patients. If successful, the benefit of a reduced burden from ADT in older prostate cancer patients as a result of this study could be considerable.

The objective of the proposed human intervention study remains to determine whether a combined administration of quercetin and green tea (GT) will increase the bioavailability and decrease the metabolism of GT polyphenols (GTPs) such as epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). Factors limiting the biological activity of GTPs are the reduced bioavailability and extensive metabolism converting EGCG into methylated metabolites with decreased activity. In our previous human intervention study in men drinking 6 cups of green tea daily prior to prostatectomy we demonstrated that GTPs are present in human prostate tissue. However 50 percent of EGCG was found in methylated form. Quercetin, a flavonoid found in onions, apples, broccoli, berries and teas is a natural inhibitor of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and multidrug resistance transport proteins (MRP1 and MRP2). Our cell culture studies demonstrated that the combined treatment with EGCG and quercetin led to a 4 to 10-fold increase in intracellular concentration of EGCG and significant decrease in EGCG methylation, depending on the cell line used. We demonstrated in mouse prostate cancer xenograft studies that the administration of the combination of GT with quercetin significantly decreased tumor volume, increased EGCG tissue concentration and decreased the methylation of EGCG significantly compared to treatment with GT or quercetin alone. The combined administration also significantly decreased the protein expression of methyltransferases and MRP1. We therefore propose a placebo- controlled, double-blinded, randomized, parallel two arm human pilot intervention study to determine whether the consumption of GT extract and quercetin will increase the bioavailability of GTPs in blood and prostate tissue and decrease the methylation of EGCG. We will administer two capsules of GT extract combined with one capsule of quercetin (N=25) or with one placebo capsule (N=15) twice daily for 3 weeks to men scheduled for prostatectomy. After 10 participants will complete the intervention, liver toxicity will be evaluated. In the absence of lier toxicity the quercetin dose will be doubled (800 mg daily) (N=15). GTPs, quercetin and methylated metabolites will be analyzed in blood and prostate tissue using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with coularray electrochemical detection (ECD). To evaluate the mechanism involved, COMT and DNA methyltransferase enzyme activities and gene and protein expression as well as MRP1 gene and protein expression and global DNA methylation will be determined in tumor and normal prostate tissue and COMT activity in erythrocytes using HPLC-ECD, real time qPCR and Western blot analyses. The results will lay the foundation for future clinical trials to evaluate the interaction of quercetin and GT in chemoprevention of early stages of prostate cancer.        ","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The potential of green tea to prevent or treat prostate cancer is limited due to restricted uptake and fast metabolism and excretion of the green tea chemicals. We propose a human intervention study to test the potential of another natural chemical from onions and apples called quercetin to increase the tissue concentration and decrease the metabolism/excretion of green tea chemicals.

Dr. Cave will conduct a mechanistic study evaluating the effects of zinc sulfate therapy in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis (AC). Highlights of Dr. Cave's career development plan include: (i) obtaining a Master of Science degree in Interdisciplinary Studies (I-MS) focusing on toxicology, clinical trial design, and biostatistics, and (ii) board certification in nutrition (ABPNS). These activities will occur in the setting of the recently funded University of Louisville Alcohol Research Center (P01), and will be monitored quarterly by an advisory committee. An estimated two million Americans have ALD, and there are no FDA approved medications for any stage of ALD. Our preliminary data document (i) zinc deficiency in human subjects with AC, and (ii) improvement in liver injury and in postulated mechanisms of liver injury with zinc supplementation in murine models. Our hypothesis is that zinc sulfate therapy will result in improvement in mechanisms postulated to play a role in the development and progression of human AC. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, 'drop in', mechanistic study of zinc sulfate 220 mg daily in 30 subjects with Child-Pugh A-B AC for 24 months. The primary endpoints are reduction in (i) serum endotoxemia and (ii) ex vivo basal and endotoxin-stimulated TNF1 production. Secondary endpoints are (i) improved serum zinc status, (ii) increased intestinal tight junctions with decreased permeability, (iii) improved serum pro-inflammatory cytokine profile, (iv) reduced oxidative stress and improved serum antioxidant status, (v) reduced hepatocyte death, (vi) decreased fibrosis, and (vii) improved clinical status.

Understanding how these spillovers work within the household could enable the design of smarter health policies which take into account households' optimal readjustments. But we cannot fully measure these reallocation responses without data on dietary intake, which is arguably the most important health resource, especially for children in low-income settings. I propose to 1) acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to collect such data, and 2) use it to analyze the effects of nutrition interventions on the intra-household distribution of food and other health resources.  To accomplish the first goal, I will engage in three training activities which will enable me to learn about key concepts in nutritional science and measurement issues in dietary intake assessment in low-income settings: 1) coursework, 2) mentoring meetings, and 3) dissemination of my work. To accomplish the second, I will engage in a research program related to understanding the intra-household spillovers of targeted nutrition interventions, focusing on iodine supplementation.  Iodine deficiency disorder (IDD) has significant and irreversible effects on cognitive development.  One third of the global population has IDD. Low in utero exposure to iodine leads to reduced intelligence quotients, and in severe cases can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm delivery and growth, hearing and speech problems. Iodine supplementation and fortification programs-both in utero and in early childhood-have been proven to increase child health and cognitive ability, and are thus often used as policy tools in affected areas. Supplementation programs are usually targeted towards pregnant women and young children. However, little is known about how these interventions affect other children in the household who are not targeted.  My research program has 3 specific aims: 1) collect novel data which combine socioeconomic and demographic information with dietary intake measurements for every child in the household; 2) document the patterns of intra-household allocation of food and other health resources; and 3) study the effects of fetal and early childhood iodine supplementation interventions on the intra-household distribution of food and other health resources amongst children.  I will accomplish the first aim by designing a dietary intake assessment module and integrating it into a large-scale household panel survey in Ghana. I will accomplish Aim 2 by performing preliminary analyses with these new data. I will accomplish the last aim through two studies. In the first, I will study the effects of a large feta iodine supplementation program in Tanzania using an existing, nationally representative dataset. In this study, I will apply econometric techniques developed for intra-household analyses to examine whether children exposed to more iodine while in utero receive more health resources than their untreated siblings during childhood. In the second study, I will implement and analyze data from a pilot field experiment that will distribute iodine supplements to children under 5 in Ghana. The experiment will run concurrently with the panel survey data collection, allowing me to measure the resulting changes in dietary intake and other health resource allocations.  Without quantifying the household responses to childhood nutrition interventions, particularly in the context of iodine supplementation policies, it is impossible to know the full impact of these programs. Answering this question-are we helping or hurting other children in the household through targeted interventions?-is essential to the design and improved cost-benefit analysis of childhood nutrition programs around the world.","It is impossible to gauge the full impacts of childhood nutrition interventions without measuring how households redistribute resources among children in response.

Obesity is a state of high adipose-tissue renin-angiotensin system (RAS) activity, hypoadiponectinemia, and vitamin D deficiency. These intertwined metabolic abnormalities contribute to increased cardiovascular risk in obesity. The applicant's prior data support the hypothesis that vitamin D therapy may be an effective strategy to lower adipose-tissue RAS activity and raise circulating adiponectin in obesity; these favorable metabolic profiles could reduce cardiovascular risk in obesity.  The applicant proposes to study 60 obese human subjects in a well-controlled physiologic experimental protocol that is designed to test whether the active vitamin D metabolite, calcitriol, can modulate adipose-tissue RAS activity and influence circulating adiponectin levels in obesity. The specific aims of this project are designed to test: 1) whether calcitriol interacts with the vitamin D receptor to reduce adipose-tissue renin expression in obesity; and 2) whether calcitriol therapy raises circulating adiponectin in obesity. Although each aim addresses a specific relevant metabolic question, both utilize the same study population and core study design to maximize efficiency and resources. Study subjects will be randomized to calcitriol therapy or placebo for two weeks. Aim 1 will evaluate adipose-tissue renin expression before and after intervention, and whether the effect of calcitriol is influenced by genetic variation at Fok1: a functional polymorphism of the vitamin D receptor gene. Aim 2 will assess circulating adiponectin before and after intervention.  The demonstration that vitamin D therapy modulates the expression of hormones that mediate vascular disease (the RAS and adiponectin) is crucial to the current medical debate surrounding vitamin D and its potentially therapeutic properties; it would strongly support the role of vitamin D supplementation in obesity. This is particularly relevant since obesity and vitamin D deficiency are epidemics that occur in tandem, and are the focus of large-scale NIH funded prospective randomized trials. In this regard, the applicant's results could serve as an important physiologic mechanism to explain the results of these concurrent trials; an issue of high relevance for the NIH and NHLBI. The applicant has a long track-record of success in academic research, and extensive experience conducting human physiology studies investigating vitamin D, the RAS, and adiponectin biology in obesity. The NIH has awarded him the NIH F32 (NRSA) and Loan Repayment Awards for his related projects.

It will collect long-term follow up data (anthropometry and cognitive development) on these populations and will then conduct a genome wide association study (GWAS) to assess host genetic determinants of diarrhea susceptibility and impact and of intervention outcomes. In a separate population, the project will build on an existing pedigree database to double the number of individuals studied, and to allow staged replicate studies of GWAS findings using salivary DNA. The project will collect pedigree, anthropometry, and diarrhea records and genotype the commonest pathogens. Thus we shall address the microbial and host genetic determinants of 5 phenotypic outcomes of enteric infections and malnutrition as well as the effects of micronutrient and nutrient therapy on these outcomes: 1. specific infection, 2. overt diarrhea, 3. intestinal inflammation and absorptive function, 4. stunted growth, and 5. cognitive impairment. More specifically, the aims are to: 1. In long-term follow-up of at least 400 children from completed clinical trials: a) Assess the long- term impact of zinc, Vitamin A, glutamine, and arginine (ZAQR) by collecting follow-up data on anthropometry and cognitive development in children from 2 completed ICIDR clinical trials, b) Conduct a Genome Wide Association Study on salivary DNA from these 400 children to assess host genetic determinants of short-term (intestinal barrier function, intestinal inflammation, and diarrhea burdens) and long-term (growth and cognition) benefits of ZAQR. 2. In a pedigree cohort of families of >500 children with detailed diarrhea data over 1-2 years: a) Expand pilot pedigree analyses to >2000 individuals in families including >500 children with diarrhea records for at least 12m from birth-3yo (existing database includes >1000 individuals of whom 277 are children with diarrhea surveillance) to quantify Cryptosporidium, Giardia, and enteropathic E. coli (EAEC, EPEC, and ETEC). b) Assess the role of genotype of top pathogens in determining their impact (i.e., C. parvum/hominis; Giardia assemblage and EAEC, EPEC and ETEC genotypes), c) Further define host genetic determinants of infection outcomes with 1536 chip analyses of DNA from >1440 persons in the pedigreed population as an independent replicate of GWAS findings in Aim 1 above.       RELEVANCE (See instructions): This project will document the long-term impact of diarrhea and malnutrition-as well as the benefits of major interventions-on growth and cognitive development. It will link these outcomes and intervention effectiveness with host genetic analyses, using linkage, SNP, and GWAS approaches.

Data from laboratory studies, epidemiologic research, and small prevention trials strongly suggest that these nutritional agents reduce the risk of autoimmune diseases, reduce levels of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines, and decrease chronic joint pain. However, large primary prevention trials with adequate dosing in general populations (i.e., unselected for disease risk) have never been conducted. The growing enthusiasm for supplemental vitamin D and fish oils underscores the urgent need for their timely testing, before their use becomes so prevalent as to render participant recruitment and hypothesis testing impossible. The NIH-funded VITAL randomized controlled trial about to begin will involve 20,000 men aged e60 and women aged e65 recruited from a mailing to 1.2 million persons, including members of AARP (formerly known as the American Association of Retired Persons), and others. The mailing will contain a letter describing the trial, an informed consent form, and a questionnaire about past medical history, including autoimmune diseases and a screening assessment of chronic knee pain, as well as diet, medication and nutritional supplement use. At the end of a 3 month placebo run-in, those who remain willing and eligible, and who report having taken at least two-thirds of the pills, will be randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups for 5 years: vitamin D3 (1600 IU/d) and fish oil (EPA+DHA, 1 g/d); vitamin D3 and fish oil placebo; placebo vitamin D3 and fish oil; and placebo vitamin D3 and placebo fish oil. At yearly intervals, participants will receive a new supply of pills, and assessments of incident autoimmune diseases, knee pain, compliance and potential side effects. A physician endpoints committee will confirm all autoimmune disease endpoints by medical record review. We anticipate validation of 600 incident cases of autoimmune disease, giving us sufficient statistical power to assess supplement effects on disease incidence. Blood samples at baseline and in follow-up will be collected in a random subcohort of 2000 individuals and analyzed for changes in biomarkers of systemic inflammation: C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-a. Approximately 2000 individuals with chronic, frequent knee pain will be followed with annual questionnaires, providing ample statistical power to evaluate the supplement effects upon chronic knee pain. To complete the pre-randomization assessment of knee pain, it is critically important that this ancillary study be undertaken in parallel to enrollment for the parent VITAL trial, beginning January 2010. Given the NIH-funded VITAL trial and our success with prior large mail-based trials and cohort studies, the proposed trial will furnish either definitive positive or informative null results regarding the central study hypotheses.       ","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purported health benefits of vitamin D and marine omega-3 fatty acids for preventing autoimmune diseases, decreasing inflammation and relieving joint pain are receiving increasing attention in the medical literature and the popular press. However, definitive data supporting these health benefits of these two readily available over-the-counter agents are lacking. Findings from this large randomized clinical trial will clarify the roles of vitamin D and marine omega-3 fatty acid supplements for the prevention of autoimmune diseases, effects on levels of biomarkers of systemic inflammation, and treatment for chronic knee pain in older men and women.

In 2011, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) concluded that while scientific evidence supports a role of vitamin D for bone health, compelling evidence was lacking for non-bone health outcomes such as neuromuscular function due to the paucity of randomized trials. The IOM committee also concluded that 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D)  concentrations e20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) were sufficient for bone and overall health. This conclusion has sparked  controversy as a large volume of observational research has found that 25(OH)D concentrations e30 ng/mL  (75 nmol/L) are beneficial for non-bone health outcomes. The resolution of this controversy is important since  almost 20 million older adults (or one-half of the older U.S. adult population) have 25(OH)D concentrations  between 20 and 30 ng/mL. There is growing evidence that vitamin D's effect on reducing falls is mediated by  improvements in neuromuscular function. Observational studies show associations between 25(OH)D  concentrations and muscle strength and physical performance measures associated with fall risk (e.g., gait,  balance). Results from previous vitamin D supplementation trials on changes in muscle strength and physical  performance have been equivocal, however. Moreover, the underlying mechanisms for vitamin D's effect on  neuromuscular function are lacking. We propose to: 1) determine whether increasing 25(OH)D concentrations  to e30 ng/mL will improve neuromuscular function in older adults with initial 25(OH)D concentrations of 20-<30  ng/mL~ and 2) examine potential underlying mechanisms by which vitamin D supplementation may enhance  muscle physiology and performance.

Anemia of any degree is recognized as a significant independent contributor to morbidity, mortality, and frailty in the elderly. Furthermore, race appears to be an important variable affecting anemia prevalence, with African-Americans displaying significantly higher rates of anemia than whites. As the number of elderly individuals is expected to reach unprecedented levels in the 21st century, anemia represents an emerging global health problem negatively impacting quality of life in the elderly population and requiring ever increasing allocation of health care resources. The pathogenesis of anemia in the elderly remains poorly studied and, as a consequence, there is a lack of proven preventive therapies. We recently showed that vitamin D deficiency is independently associated with a higher prevalence of anemia in the elderly, particularly among those with anemia of inflammation. We will take advantage of the VITAL study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial analyzing the role of vitamin D3 and marine omega-3 fatty acid (?-3 FA) supplements in the primary prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease among 20,000 US men and women aged > 60 and > 65 years, respectively, to test the hypothesis that these interventions will ameliorate the development of anemia in the elderly. In addition, using a sub-sample of the VITAL cohort, we will investigate whether vitamin D and/or ?-3 FA influence erythropoiesis via hepcidin- and/or erythropoietin (EPO)-dependent pathways. We aim to determine whether vitamin D and/or w-3 FA supplements reduce the incidence of diagnosed anemia through the use of medical record review and supplementary questionnaires completed by participants' physicians. In our sub-study, fresh samples will be collected pre- and post-intervention from 900 subjects who will be evaluated at the Boston Clinical and Translational Science Center (CTSC). Using serial measurements of hemoglobin (HgB), red blood cell (RBC) indices, hepcidin, and erythropoietin, we will determine whether vitamin D and/or w-3 FA moderate inflammation-mediated effects on Hgb levels and erythropoietic pathways. The research infrastructure of the parent VITAL trial will provide a unique and cost-effective framework that will allow us to examine the potential benefits of vitamin D and/or w-3 FA supplementation in decreasing anemia in an elderly population. In order to complete baseline (pre-randomization) assessments of Hgb and erythropoietic pathways on fresh samples that will be collected from participants at the Boston CTSC site, it is critically important that this proposl begin in parallel to the 1-year enrollment period for the parent VITAL trial (1U01CA138962), scheduled to begin November 2011.        ","Vitamin D and omega-3s appear to have favorable effects on chronic inflammation, but their impact on the risk and pathogenesis of anemia, which is often inflammation-related, remains largely unknown. Findings from this proposed study conducted within a large clinical trial will document definitively whether vitamin D or omega-3 supplementation ameliorates inflammation-mediated suppression of erythropoiesis and reduces the incidence of anemia in the elderly.",

Emerging biologic and epidemiologic data suggest antimicrobial benefits from vitamin D supplements, and possibly marine omega-3 fatty acids (I-3 FA). However, large, long-term prevention trials with adequate dosing in general populations are not available. The IOM recently called for more research on vitamin D. We propose to take advantage of a large NIH-funded study - the VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) - to examine the short- and long-term effects of vitamin D and I-3 FA supplements on infection. We also will examine the effect of vitamin D on plasma levels of human cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide (hCAP18), a potential mechanism for the hypothesized antimicrobial benefits of vitamin D. VITAL is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2x2 factorial trial with 20,000 participants (men age e60y; women e65y). Starting in April 2011 and continuing through July 2012, subjects will be enrolled in a 3-month run-in, during which they will receive placebos. At the end of the run-in, those who remain willing and eligible, and who report having taken at least two-thirds of pills, will be randomly assigned to one of four groups for 5 years: vitamin D3 (2000 IU/d) and fish oil (EPA+DHA, 1 g/d); vitamin D3 and fish oil placebo; placebo vitamin D3 and fish oil; and placebo vitamin D3 and placebo fish oil. At 1-year intervals, participants will receive a new supply of pills and a follow-up questionnaire on compliance, possible side effects, and incidence of endpoints. Primary aims of this ancillary study will address upper respiratory infections (URIs) and require the timely creation of a subcohort (10% sample, n=2,000) in early 2012. This URI subcohort will receive special mailings in Feb/Mar 2012 (baseline), Oct/Nov 2012, and Feb/Mar 2013 (same season, 1 year later). The latter mailings will collect details about recent URIs (e.g., severity, duration of illness, treatments). We will collect baseline and 1-year follow-up blood specimens to test for changes in 25(OH)D, I-3, and hCAP18 levels. These data will answer several questions, including whether vitamin D increases hCAP18 levels, and whether this change mediates the hypothesized reduction in URIs. Secondary aims will examine several other types of infections (pneumonia & influenza, urinary tract infections, skin, any antimicrobial-treated infection, infection-related hospitalizations/sepsis), which we will confirm by CMS linkage. In a subset of 250 cases of each outcome, we will further confirm endpoints by supplemental questionnaire. Long-term follow-up will allow us to address the emerging concern that an early beneficial effect could be followed by a weakening or even reversal of benefit with prolonged supplementation. The current study presents a highly efficient and innovative strategy to evaluate vitamin D and I-3 FA supplementation for short- and long-term prevention of infectious diseases, and to test hCAP18 as a potential mechanism. The findings may have direct clinical and public health impact for the prevention of infections in older adults.

During the past 2 cycles of this study we obtained and verified genetic and proteomic signatures of ECD. In the process we established a model of pre-clinical 'early' ECD using chronically non-pressor doses of L-NMMA. Renal microvasculature of these mice revealed depletion of 2 key mitochondrial enzymes - enoyl- CoA-hydratase-1 (ECHS-1) and aconitase-2 (Aco-2). Consequently, TCA cycle was inhibited, mitochondrial biogenesis suppressed, and normoxic glycolysis prevailed resulting in the increase of lactate production - a metabolic profile which is a hallmark of Warburg effect. Present application is based on a hypothesis that this metabolic profile of ECD may explain some abnormalities in the pathways of mitochondrial and cytosolic glucose-lipid metabolism. A therapeutic corollary of these findings predicts the possibility of correcting 'truncated' TCA cycle by introducing an intermediate bypassing the enzymatic block potentially resulting in alleviation of ECD. Another major goal consists in obtaining the metabolic signatures of advanced ECD accompanied by hypoxic glycolysis (Pasteur effect). We hypothesize that it is responsible for the induction of HIFs, VEGF, and an increase in vascular permeability. Four Specific Aims are proposed: 1) profiling glucose metabolism of dysfunctional endothelium: links to redox, lipid metabolism, and glyceroneogenesis; 2) metabolic consequences of Pasteur effect (hypoxic glycolysis) in advanced ECD: induction of HIFs, VEGF and increased vascular permeability; 3) glutamine bypasses mitochondrial enzymatic blockade in endothelial dysfunction: metabolic and functional consequences; culminating in 4) a proof of principal clinical trial of glutamine supplementation in patients with CKD 3-4. Results of these investigations should offer a detailed picture of metabolic disturbances associated with ECD in vitro and in vivo, have a potential to disclose a mechanistically rational therapeutic intervention to restore metabolism and alleviate manifestations of ECD, and finally test these findings on glutamine supplementation and vascular functions in a pilot clinical trial of a select patient population with CKD 3-4.        "," Studies proposed in this grant application should shed light on two concepts: 1) incompetence of stem/progenitor cells in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) contributes to the insufficient regenerative processes thus accounting in part for progression of disease and 2) stem cell incompetence is reversible and can be pharmacologically corrected thus resulting in reduction of the rate of progression or even regression of disease. Among the potential causes of stem cell incompetence in CKD we shall focus on a) stem cell-related factors and b) stem cell niche-related factors, as well as attempt pharmacologic correction of stem cell incompetence. These studies should supplement the search for mechanisms of progression of CKD by exploring the regenerative potential and its failure in these morbid states and offering alternative therapeutic strategies.

Building upon a background in nutrition and epidemiology, the mentored phase of this award will provide training in 1) study management and oversight, 2) advanced nutritional biochemistry and the mathematical modeling of one-carbon metabolism, and 3) laboratory sciences. The acquired skills will be applied to the current area of research, investigating the influence of nutrients involved in one-carbon metabolism on the methylation of both arsenic (As) and genomic DNA. Specifically, the roles of two nutrients, choline and betaine - i.e. key nutrients involved in methylation pathways - which have not previously been considered in relation to As and DNA methylation, will be examined. Roughly 140 million people in over 70 countries are chronically exposed to As- contaminated drinking water at concentrations far exceeding the World Health Organization standard of 10 ¿g/L. As is a class I carcinogen known to cause cancers of the skin, bladder, and lung, as well as ischemic heart disease and neurologic impairments. Methylation of ingested inorganic arsenic (InAs) to methylarsonic- (MMA) and dimethylarsinic acids (DMA) relies on nutrient-dependent one carbon metabolism and facilitates urinary As elimination. Methylation of DNA via one-carbon metabolism is an epigenetic modification that plays critical roles in the regulation of gene expression and maintenance of chromosomal stability, and may play a role in the underlying mechanism of As-induced carcinogenesis. In the mentored phase, the influence of choline and betaine on methylation of As and DNA will be investigated in an existing cross-sectional study of 375 Bangladeshi adults exposed to a wide range of As concentrations in drinking water. In the independent phase, the skills acquired during the training will be applied to further investigate the roles of choline and betaine, including their interactions with other nutrients, i.e. folate and creatine, in the methylation of both As and DNA utilizing data and biospecimens from a randomized controlled trial of 600 individuals chronically exposed to As. In addition, mathematical models of one-carbon metabolism will be employed to conduct in silico experiments in conjunction with the clinical trial. These experiments will 1) allow the models to be further validated against the clinical trial data and 2) provide a deeper mechanistic understanding of the results from the trial. At the conclusion of this award, Dr. Hall will have developed into an independent multidisciplinary investigator well positioned to develop additional hypotheses related to the role of nutrient/environment interactions in disease development."," PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: On a global basis, WHO estimates that more than 140 million people in at least 70 countries are exposed to arsenic (As)-contaminated drinking water, most in the developing world where nutritional deficiencies are common. The proposed studies of choline and betaine build considerably upon the goals of the research of the parent studies, which is to identify interventions to reduce blood As concentrations (i.e. internal As exposure) through simple, low-cost, low-risk nutritional manipulations of one- carbon metabolism. Previous work by our group has shown that folic acid supplementation in folate-deficient As-exposed individuals facilitated As elimination and significantly lowered blood As concentrations. However, the finding that there were also many individuals who did not appear to be responsive to folic acid suggests the possibility that there is room to improve on the efficacy of FA and that some individuals could potentially benefit from another therapeutic modality such as choline or betaine. Considering the magnitude of the exposed population worldwide, and the severity of the numerous associated health outcomes, we feel this work is highly significant as it implies that simple, low-cost, low-risk interventions could have therapeutic potential for ameliorating the long-term health consequences for the many populations at risk.",

Diabetes affects 1 in 10 persons in the United States and is projected to increase to 1 in 4 persons by 2050. Women with type 2 diabetes have worse outcomes than men with type 2 diabetes. This may be due to depression which affects over 25% of women with diabetes. Depression interferes with self-care behaviors and significantly impacts glycemic control. Antidepressants are effective for the treatment of depression but can disrupt glycemic control and cause weight gain, making diabetes self-management challenging. Research has shown that vitamin D supplementation can improve depressive symptoms in healthy, obese individuals suggesting its use for amelioration of these symptoms in other groups. We recently completed a six month proof of concept study using a one group, pre-post test design to examine the effects of weekly vitamin D supplementation (50,000 IUs weekly) in women with type 2 diabetes who had significant depressive symptoms (a score > 16 on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Tool (CES-D) (NIH 5P60DK020595, pilot project). We found a significant decrease in depression symptoms, improvements in diabetes self- management, and a decrease in systolic blood pressure. Several small studies have shown that vitamin D supplementation may lower blood pressure by direct and indirect vascular effects. We now propose a randomized trial to determine the efficacy of vitamin D3 supplementation on depressive symptoms, self- management, and blood pressure in women with type 2 diabetes who have significant depressive symptoms (n=150). Using a stratified block randomization (strata based on depression symptom severity) women will be assigned to either weekly vitamin D3 supplementation (50,000 IUs) or a matching weekly placebo for a period of six months. Since guidelines recommend assessing vitamin D levels at three months upon initiating this dose, study measurements will be collected at baseline, three, and six months. The following outcomes will be measured: depressive symptoms, diabetes self-management (self-efficacy, diabetes distress, diabetes self- care behaviors), and systolic blood pressure. We hypothesize that women receiving vitamin D3 supplementation will report fewer depressive symptoms, increased diabetes self- management mediated by depression improvement, and have a lower systolic BP compared to those taking placebo. We will also explore a possible mechanistic effect of vitamin D supplementation on depression. Evidence indicates that in depression, pro-inflammatory biomarkers, notably cytokines and C-reactive protein (CRP), are elevated. Some of these inflammatory biomarkers alter the metabolic pathway of tryptophan by shunting it away from serotonin synthesis via stimulation of the enzyme indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO). Several studies (not depression studies) have reported that Vitamin D can decrease levels of inflammatory biomarkers. Thus we will explore whether vitamin D supplementation decreases inflammatory biomarkers (CRP, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor- ¿) providing evidence for a plausible mechanism of antidepressant activity. Vitamin D supplementation has minimal side effects and is low in cost. Thus, the potential for using this therapy is highly significant fr women with type 2 diabetes and other chronic populations who suffer from symptoms of depression which significantly impacts the self-management of their health.          ","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Can the Sunshine Vitamin Improve Mood and Self-Management in Women with Diabetes? Public Information: Vitamin D deficiency is a worldwide problem with research to suggest it may be beneficial to mental well being. Evidence indicates that insufficient levels of vitamin D are associated with depressive symptoms. Women with diabetes are burdened with these symptoms which can significantly affect their diabetes self- management. Women with diabetes also have insufficient levels of vitamin D. This study will determine whether providing vitamin D supplementation can improve mood and subsequently enhance diabetes self-management. If effective, this could be a low cost treatment for women with type 2 diabetes who are at greatest risk for depression and poor glycemic control.                    ",

However, more than 90% of Americans consume less than 40% of the 15 mg (22 IU) 1-tocopherol recommended daily by the Food and Nutrition Board. Is the usual 6 mg consumed sufficient? The necessary evidence-based data are currently unavailable to answer this question; the proposed study seeks to fill this gap. Our previous studies show that oxidative stress in humans more rapidly depletes plasma vitamin E and sufficient vitamin C intake counters the accelerated vitamin E depletion. The proposed studies will use optimized methods for pharmacokinetic measurements to address how much vitamin E is needed by the body in response to either or both oxidative stress or depleted vitamin C status. This study is unique in that it is a collaboration between NIH intra- and extramural investigators. The proposed studies will be carried out with Dr. Mark Levine and his group at the NIH in the Clinical Research Center, who have extensive experience in measuring vitamin C pharmacokinetics and bioavailability. Our laboratory has the necessary expertise, experience and equipment to measure the low concentrations of stable isotope labeled vitamin E, its metabolites, and peroxidation biomarkers. This proposal seeks funding for the Traber group for the analysis of deuterium-labeled alpha-tocopherol samples and lipid peroxidation biomarkers. Specific Aim 1. Determine alpha-tocopherol pharmacokinetics in normal weight women. Vitamin E kinetic studies will allow determination of key measures of vitamin E status including fractional absorption, rates of delivery to tissues, and whole body efflux. Pilot Study 1: Determine the optimal fat content in the accompanying meal necessary to optimize alpha-tocopherol absorption. Pilot Study 2: Determine the optimal alpha-tocopherol dose for turnover kinetics. Specific Aims 2 & 3. Determine alpha-tocopherol pharmacokinetics before and after vitamin C depletion in normal-weight women, obese women and obese women with diabetes. Our working hypothesis is that alpha-tocopherol concentrations are maintained by adequate vitamin C (ascorbic acid) concentrations. Thus, the delivery of alpha-tocopherol to the target tissues will be increased if ascorbic acid is limiting. Furthermore to maintain tissue alpha-tocopherol concentrations, rates of delivery of alpha-tocopherol increase due to increased turnover resulting from oxidative stress caused by obesity and from obesity with diabetes. The successful completion of these studies will provide essential key measures of alpha-tocopherol status, including fractional absorption, rates of delivery to tissues, and whole body efflux, for formulation of recommended daily intakes in healthy women, as well as women with conditions associated with increased oxidative stress.      "," We have shown that alpha-tocopherol is the most potent vitamin E form because the human body actively regulates its plasma concentrations and delivery to tissues while other vitamin E forms are actively metabolized and excreted. The proposed studies will use optimized methods for pharmacokinetic measurements and apply these to the problem of assessing 'how much vitamin E is needed by the body?', and do these needs change with increased oxidative stress or decreased vitamin C status.

Smoking during pregnancy remains a major public health problem as at least 12% of pregnant women cannot quit smoking during pregnancy. This addiction is the largest preventable cause of childhood respiratory illness, including asthma, and children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy show lifetime decreases in pulmonary function. Smoking is a unique morbidity in that it is addictive, heavily advertised and recent genome studies show there are genotypes that significantly increase the likelihood of being unable to quit. Teen pregnancy, low income, low education, and living with another smoker are important factors increasing the odds of smoking during pregnancy. Pulmonary function tests done shortly after birth in babies born to mothers who smoked during pregnancy show decreased pulmonary function as measured by decreased respiratory flows and compliance and altered tidal breathing patterns. These changes can still be measured even after the infants have reached adulthood. Multiple epidemiologic studies show that these decreases in pulmonary function lead to increased respiratory disease and costs of hundreds of millions of dollars per year. The primary aim of this multi-site study is to demonstrate improved pulmonary function testing at 3 months of age, in infants delivered to smoking mothers who are randomized to 500 mg/day of supplemental vitamin C versus placebo prior to 22 weeks of pregnancy. Patients will meet with research personnel at each prenatal visit and smoking cessation will be actively encouraged. Patients will be monitored with a set of serial biomarkers to assess smoking and medication compliance, including urine cotinines levels, smoking questionnaires, pill counts and fasting plasma ascorbic acid levels. Pulmonary function tests will be done at 3 months of age and will measure forced expiratory flows. Success of this study is supported by strong pilot data from Dr. McEvoy's K23 showing statistically significant improvements in pulmonary function tests in infants born to smoking mothers who received vitamin C, and preliminary data showing a lower incidence of wheezing at 1 year of age in these infants. Key genetic polymorphisms shown to increase sensitivity to in utero smoke exposure will also be measured. The success of this study is also supported by animal models showing the effectiveness of vitamin C to preserve pulmonary function and genetic and epidemiologic studies linking the effects of smoking during pregnancy to oxidant mechanisms. Given nicotine's addictive nature, the underserved socio-economic nature of the patient population, and the constant advertising by tobacco companies, smoking during pregnancy will continue to adversely victimize millions of babies worldwide. This research has great public health significance to potentially alter the fetal origins of respiratory disease by blocking some of the effects of in-utero smoke exposure on lung development.        ","         Maternal smoking during pregnancy is the largest preventable cause of childhood respiratory illness, and children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy show lifetime decreases in pulmonary function and increased respiratory illnesses and asthma. Maternal smoking is estimated to cause 10% of direct medical expenditures in the first year of life and approximately 20% of expenditures for childhood respiratory illness are caused by maternal smoking. The findings from this project will support the addition of a simple, safe, and inexpensive adjunct to current smoking cessation counseling that would significantly decrease the impact of smoking during pregnancy on child respiratory health both in the US and world-wide.

Importantly, CVD mortality of African American women exceeds that of white women and although the rates of CVD mortality are declining overall in men and women, they are declining most slowly in African American women. As the US population ages and lives longer the incidence of CVD will become a disproportionately greater problem for African American women. The explanation for ethnic differences in CVD risk is multifactorial and complex with insufficiency of vitamin D providing a provocative and testable hypothesis as a possible link between CVD risk factors (particularly hypertension in African Americans) and increased risk of atherosclerosis in African Americans. The possibility of a causal link between vitamin D deficiency and CVD is supported by many studies as well as strong biological plausibility. Given the aging population and rapidly increasing incidence of obesity, vitamin D insufficiency is becoming an increasingly important public health issue that may contribute to CVD. This may be particularly relevant for African American women, who are at particular risk for CVD since increased skin pigmentation reduces the capacity of skin to synthesize vitamin D and due to decreased bioavailability of vitamin D in obesity, which disproportionately affects African American women. Although data suggest a possible beneficial effect of vitamin D supplementation in reducing CVD, a direct anti- atherogenic effect from randomized controlled trials is limited. The goal of this proposal is to integrate an ancillary stuy of atherosclerosis imaging into the parent trial, 'Vitamin D and Osteoporosis Prevention in Elderly African Americans,' a 4-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to investigate the effect of vitamin D status in elderly African American women. 250 African American women >65 years old with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels greater than 20 nmol/L but less than 65 nmol/L will be randomized to sufficient vitamin D3 supplementation once daily to raise serum 25(OH)D levels to between 75 nmol/L and 172 nmol/L versus placebo.

Traditional CVD risk factors do not completely explain these risks, and therapies with established benefit in the general population have not consistently proven effective in CKD. Animal studies suggest that higher serum phosphate may be a causal risk factor for these outcomes in CKD patients. Similar findings are supported by observational data in humans. Leading international guidelines recommend lowering serum phosphate using binders and dietary phosphate restriction in CKD patients. However, we have recently conducted randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in CKD patients demonstrating that these approaches are minimally effective, difficult for patients adherence, and may cause harm. Novel approaches are needed, and we have identified the lipid drug niacin as a potential therapeutic agent for phosphate lowering. Animal studies demonstrate that niacin blocks intestinal phosphate absorption. Studies in ESRD patients, and our pilot studies in CKD patients, suggest that niacin may substantially lower phosphate levels by approximately 2 to 10 fold more than binders or phosphate restriction. In addition, preliminary data suggest that niacin may slow progression of CKD. Thus, by extension, niacin may ultimately improve fracture, CVD, and ESRD risk in CKD patients. Funded by the NHLBI, AIM-HIGH is a recently completed large RCT of niacin in patients with prevalent CVD, and 12% of AIM-HIGH patients had CKD at baseline. We propose an ancillary study in AIM-HIGH participants with CKD examining the randomized treatment effect of niacin on (1) serum phosphate levels, (2) other measures of mineral metabolism, and (3) change in kidney function over 3 years. This efficient design will provide substantial new insights to treatment of mineral bone disorder in CKD with minimal patient risk, and has the potential to rapidly change clinical practice for the 27 million persons with CKD in the US, and many more worldwide.          ","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic kidney disease is common and strongly linked with risk of fractures, cardiovascular disease, and end stage renal disease. Kidney disease patients have higher serum phosphate levels, and higher phosphate may be causing the higher risk of these outcomes.

We have identified that the lipid drug niacin lower serum phosphate through a unique mechanism.

Most active TB cases arise in adults as a consequence of reactivation of a latent TB infection (LTBI) acquired in childhood. An estimated 2.3 billion people have LTBI, including 10-15 million people in the US. WHO aims to eliminate TB as a public health problem by 2050, and this will require measures to prevent acquisition of LTBI. Vitamin D has long been known to enhance innate immunity to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), and Phase 2 clinical trials show that vitamin D supplementation enhances innate immune resistance to MTB infection. We propose to conduct a Phase 3 double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial to determine whether vitamin D supplementation reduces risk of acquisition of LTBI in 7,350 uninfected schoolchildren aged 6-15 years in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, where rates of LTBI acquisition in children are particularly high as is vitamin D deficiency. Study medication will be administered over 3 years as 72 directly observed bi-weekly oral doses of 28,000 IU Vitamin D3 or placebo. We will employ a well-validated interferon-gamma release assay to determine whether participants have acquired LTBI at 3 years of follow-up (primary outcome). There is professional consensus, as highlighted in recent editorials in the Lancet [2011; 377:189-90] and PNAS [2011; 108, 18861-18862], that the trial we propose needs to be conducted. The PNAS editorial concludes that 'It is a tragic irony that vitamin D, which costs a penny a day and may enhance innate and acquired immunity to TB, is not considered a worthy investment for critical clinical trials that could determine whether supplementation can prevent disease.' The results of this trial will inform global TB control policy by determining whether vitamin D supplementation prevents acquisition of LTBI. More than one billion people worldwide are Vitamin D deficient, and supplementation is safe and inexpensive: intermittent bolus doses of vitamin D are effective in correcting deficiency, are inexpensive, easy to administer, have a very low incidence of adverse effects and much higher degree of acceptability than vaccines and antibiotics. The results of our trial will be readily generalizable to the vitamin D deficient populations at risk of TB worldwide and to the billions already infected with LTBI.          ","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tuberculosis is posing a global emergency; an astonishing one-third of the global population, including 10-15 million people in the United States, are afflicted with a latent TB infection from Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

VITAL is a 2x2 factorial RCT designed to evaluate the efficacy of vitamin D3 and marine omega-3 fatty acid supplements in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer among 20,000 older U.S. men and women. We will address two primary aims. First, we will test whether vitamin D or omega-3 supplementation reduces incident and recurrent depression rates among all participants in the trial. Cases of depression will be identified using questionnaires and additional data on psychiatric visits, diagnoses, and medications from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services database. Second, we will test whether vitamin D or omega-3 supplementation yields better continuous mood scores on repeated measures over the 5-year study period. In addition, we will address three secondary aims. First, in a substudy of 1,000 high-risk participants, defined as persons with known risk factors for late-life depression (selective prevention) or with subsyndromal depressive symptoms (indicated prevention), we will test whether the agents are effective at reducing risk of depression and at yielding lower depression scores over time. Participants in this substudy will be recruited at four Clinical and Translational Science Center (CTSC) sites across the U.S. (Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, and Houston), and will undergo a psychiatric interview at baseline and at 2 years of follow-up (visits will be matched for season, to avoid seasonal bias for vitamin D). Second, we will address whether African-American race modifies effects of vitamin D supplementation on depression risk and on mood scores in the entire VITAL cohort (African-Americans are disproportionately affected by vitamin D insufficiency). Third, in a nested case-control design, we will assess whether baseline plasma levels of vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids are related to depression risk, and whether they modify treatment effects. We will also be able to explore additive and/or synergistic effects of the agents, as well as effect modification by age, gender, baseline nutrient levels, baseline medical comorbidity, latitude, and physical activity. In summary, this proposal presents a highly efficient and innovative strategy to evaluate simultaneously the efficacy of vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid supplementation for universal, selective and indicated prevention of late-life depression, as well as to provide characterization of relevant physiologic parameters that may influence this benefit. We request funds for depression case ascertainment, psychiatric assessments, and assays of pre-randomization blood levels of vitamin D and fatty acids in a nested case-control sample. In order to test our hypotheses and to complete pre- randomization psychiatric assessments, it is critically important and time-sensitive that this ancillary study be undertaken in parallel to the enrollment period for the parent VITAL trial, which is scheduled to begin in 2010.      "," Biologic and observational evidence supports potential mental health benefits of both vitamin D and marine omega-3 fatty acids. However, it remains unclear whether the use of these supplements can prevent onset of late-life depression or can significantly reduce depressive symptoms in late-life. Findings from this proposed study, conducted within a large clinical trial among U.S. adults aged 60 years and above, will clarify whether vitamin D and/or omega-3 fatty acid supplementation reduces risk of late-life depression and depressive symptoms, and will provide important data that will be applicable to public health and clinical guidelines for both primary and secondary prevention of depression.

Despite current available medical and surgical therapies, patients with PAD continue to be at an unacceptably high risk for cardiovascular events and death. Accordingly, interventions to improve morbidity and mortality are critical. Emerging research demonstrates the inter-related effects of inflammation, vascular function and outcomes in PAD. Lifestyle modifications, including exercise and diet, may potentially improve symptoms, as well as modulate factors that influence disease progression and long-term outcomes in these patients. Fish oil has long been recognized to have beneficial effects on cardiovascular health, despite recent controversy. Recent studies have emerged on the role of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) present in fish oil in the termination of inflammation. This role offers new perspectives on the benefits of fish oil consumption. Furthermore, our group recently demonstrated that the omega-3 index, a measure of n-3 PUFA content in red blood cells, is inversely related to inflammation in patients with PAD, and others have shown that n-3 PUFA supplementation can improve vascular function. Hence, overall evidence suggests that fish oil could play a key role in the regulation of inflammatory processes and vascular dysfunction that characterize PAD. My long-term goal is to increase our understanding of how nutritional and lifestyle modifications can reduce the burden of disease in PAD. Accordingly, my goal with the present study is to determine if high-dose n-3 PUFA oral supplementation will improve systemic inflammation, vascular function, and the walking ability of patients with PAD. This will be evaluated using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 70 patients aged e 50 with PAD receiving 4.4 g/day of n-3 PUFA for 3 months. Specific measurements will include markers of both inflammation and termination of inflammation, measures of vascular function, and a walking test.  The study proposed here has the potential to provide important new insights on the role of nutritional interventions in PAD, as well as to improve our understanding of the effects of fish oil supplementation in cardiovascular diseases. It will support the goal of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute of reducing the burden of heart, lung, and blood diseases worldwide. The training plan and study protocol presented here are designed to advance my skills as an independent clinical trialist, supported by a multidisciplinary team of mentors with broad expertise in clinical trials, surgery, biostatistics, vascular biology, and molecular biology. The research will take place at the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center (SFVAMC), one of the most funded and scientifically knowledgeable VA centers in the United States. Furthermore, I will have access to institutional support and resources from both the SFVAMC and UCSF.

She has a strong foundation in epidemiologic research having completed and published in peer-reviewed journals several observational studies in the field of mineral metabolism thereby gaining experience and skills in study design, data analysis, and manuscript writing. She has presented numerous abstracts and oral presentations on her research at national meetings and has participated in a NIH sponsored randomized controlled clinical trial with her mentor, Dr. Michel Chonchol. She received a 2 year AMGEN fellowship grant for her research project on an observational study of 1133 patients with advanced CKD in which she thoroughly examined the relationship between 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) levels with all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease events, providing good preliminary data for the present proposal. Her immediate career goal is to establish herself as an independent investigator in the field of mineral metabolism. Her long-term career goal is to become a successful clinical investigator and academician and to establish and direct extramurally funded clinical studies in mineral metabolism and vascular disease in CKD patients. In order to become a successful independent investigator, Dr. Kendrick will receive training in clinical techniques including study design, patient recruitment and data analysis through her primary mentor, Dr. Chonchol, Associate Professor of Medicine at the University of Colorado at Denver and Director of Clinical Research in the Division of Renal Diseases and Hypertension, a highly experienced clinical investigator in the field of mineral metabolism and CVD in patients with CKD. She will also receive training in brachial artery flow- mediated dilation, endothelial cell collections and immunofluorescence measurements through her co-mentor Dr. Douglas Seals, Professor of Integrative Medicine at the University of Colorado at Boulder, a highly experienced and nationally renowned investigator in vascular pathophysiology. She will receive additional training in experimental design and statistical analyses through a consulting mentor, Dr. Kim McFann, Faculty member at the University of Colorado School of Public Health. She will also receive further training in conducting clinical trials through her consulting mentor, Dr. Tomas Berl, Professor of Medicine at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center. Dr. Berl has vast experience conducting clinical trials and has been a member of the Collaborative Study Group for over 20 years and now serves on the executive committee. She has already completed a Certificate in Public Health Sciences in which she took classes in biostatistics, epidemiology, research design, and ethics. She is enrolling in the Master of Public Health Program and will complete this degree in the first two years of the award period. She already has 21 of the 42 credits required for the Master's degree. She will also be involved in other activities that will enhance her academic career including opportunities for teaching and for publications. She has completed training in the responsible conduct of research through the Colorado IRB as well as public health classes and will continue to receive training throughout the award period. Dr. Kendrick will have 75-85% protected time to devote to the proposed research activities of the K23 award. She will also be provided with a research coordinator by the Nephrology Division who will help with patient recruitment and follow-up and will assist with measurements planned in this proposal. CVD is the leading cause of mortality in CKD patients and large artery damage is a major factor that contributes to death in these patients. We hypothesize that the use of calcitriol supplementation in stage IIIB and IV chronic kidney disease patients (CKD) with vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency will result in improved vascular endothelial function as compared to cholecalciferol supplementation. We will perform a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial of 128 patients comparing the effects of calcitriol versus cholecalciferol in stage IIIB and stage IV CKD patients with vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency on conduit artery endothelium- dependent dilation (EDD) measured by brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD). The primary outcome is the difference between the calcitriol and cholecalciferol groups in 6 month FMD in response to treatment. Secondary aims are focused to explore whether vitamin D improves vascular endothelial function through decreases in inflammation by determining the effects of calcitriol versus cholecalciferol on plasma concentrations of CRP, IL-6 and endothelial cell expression of NF-?B. Subjects will have these measurements performed at baseline and at 6 months and will have calcium and phosphorus drawn monthly to assess safety. This study will answer the important clinical question of whether nutritional (i.e., cholecalciferol) or active (i.e., calcitriol) vitamin D supplementation improves vascular endothelial function in moderate to severe CKD in a direct head to head comparison. Furthermore, clinical and in vitro methods will be used to identify the mechanisms by which vitamin D affects vascular endothelial function, which will enhance our understanding of the non-calcemic effects of vitamin D.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic kidney disease is an important worldwide public health problem as the number of patients with kidney disease continues to increase. Patients with moderate to severe kidney disease have a higher risk of cardiovascular death than the general population although the reasons for this increased risk remain unclear. Arterial damage occurs early in the course of kidney disease and is a major factor that contributes to death in these patients. This research proposal will focus on another epidemic in kidney disease patients, vitamin D deficiency, which may be a contributing cause to their increased vascular damage and cardiovascular disease. Vitamin D deficiency has been linked with bone disease as well as diabetes, hypertension, myocardial infarctions, heart failure and arterial dysfunction.

She has presented numerous abstracts and oral presentations on her research at national meetings and has participated in a NIH sponsored randomized controlled clinical trial with her mentor, Dr. Michel Chonchol. She received a 2 year AMGEN fellowship grant for her research project on an observational study of 1133 patients with advanced CKD in which she thoroughly examined the relationship between 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) levels with all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease events, providing good preliminary data for the present proposal. Her immediate career goal is to establish herself as an independent investigator in the field of mineral metabolism. Her long-term career goal is to become a successful clinical investigator and academician and to establish and direct extramurally funded clinical studies in mineral metabolism and vascular disease in CKD patients. In order to become a successful independent investigator, Dr. Kendrick will receive training in clinical techniques including study design, patient recruitment and data analysis through her primary mentor, Dr. Chonchol, Associate Professor of Medicine at the University of Colorado at Denver and Director of Clinical Research in the Division of Renal Diseases and Hypertension, a highly experienced clinical investigator in the field of mineral metabolism and CVD in patients with CKD. She will also receive training in brachial artery flow- mediated dilation, endothelial cell collections and immunofluorescence measurements through her co-mentor Dr. Douglas Seals, Professor of Integrative Medicine at the University of Colorado at Boulder, a highly experienced and nationally renowned investigator in vascular pathophysiology. She will receive additional training in experimental design and statistical analyses through a consulting mentor, Dr. Kim McFann, Faculty member at the University of Colorado School of Public Health. She will also receive further training in conducting clinical trials through her consulting mentor, Dr. Tomas Berl, Professor of Medicine at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center. Dr. Berl has vast experience conducting clinical trials and has been a member of the Collaborative Study Group for over 20 years and now serves on the executive committee. She has already completed a Certificate in Public Health Sciences in which she took classes in biostatistics, epidemiology, research design, and ethics. She is enrolling in the Master of Public Health Program and will complete this degree in the first two years of the award period. She already has 21 of the 42 credits required for the Master's degree.

She will also be provided with a research coordinator by the Nephrology Division who will help with patient recruitment and follow-up and will assist with measurements planned in this proposal. CVD is the leading cause of mortality in CKD patients and large artery damage is a major factor that contributes to death in these patients. We hypothesize that the use of calcitriol supplementation in stage IIIB and IV chronic kidney disease patients (CKD) with vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency will result in improved vascular endothelial function as compared to cholecalciferol supplementation. We will perform a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial of 128 patients comparing the effects of calcitriol versus cholecalciferol in stage IIIB and stage IV CKD patients with vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency on conduit artery endothelium- dependent dilation (EDD) measured by brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD). The primary outcome is the difference between the calcitriol and cholecalciferol groups in 6 month FMD in response to treatment. Secondary aims are focused to explore whether vitamin D improves vascular endothelial function through decreases in inflammation by determining the effects of calcitriol versus cholecalciferol on plasma concentrations of CRP, IL-6 and endothelial cell expression of NF-?B. Subjects will have these measurements performed at baseline and at 6 months and will have calcium and phosphorus drawn monthly to assess safety. This study will answer the important clinical question of whether nutritional (i.e., cholecalciferol) or active (i.e., calcitriol) vitamin D supplementation improves vascular endothelial function in moderate to severe CKD in a direct head to head comparison. Furthermore, clinical and in vitro methods will be used to identify the mechanisms by which vitamin D affects vascular endothelial function, which will enhance our understanding of the non-calcemic effects of vitamin D.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic kidney disease is an important worldwide public health problem as the number of patients with kidney disease continues to increase. Patients with moderate to severe kidney disease have a higher risk of cardiovascular death than the general population although the reasons for this increased risk remain unclear. Arterial damage occurs early in the course of kidney disease and is a major factor that contributes to death in these patients. This research proposal will focus on another epidemic in kidney disease patients, vitamin D deficiency, which may be a contributing cause to their increased vascular damage and cardiovascular disease. Vitamin D deficiency has been linked with bone disease as well as diabetes, hypertension, myocardial infarctions, heart failure and arterial dysfunction.

Despite strong biological plausibility and supportive observational data, the independent and, especially, synergistic anti-neoplastic effects of calcium and vitamin D in humans are not clear. Proposed mechanisms have included protection of the colonic epithelium against bile acids, direct effects on the cell cycle, and modulation of growth factor signaling, inflammation, and immune function. Based on basic science and limited human evidence, we hypothesize that calcium and vitamin D supplementation decrease blood levels of biomarkers of inflammation and colonic permeability in humans. We will investigate this in an adjunct study to an ongoing multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2 x 2 factorial chemoprevention clinical trial (n = 2,259) of supplemental calcium (1,200 mg elemental calcium daily as calcium carbonate) and vitamin D3 (1,000 IU daily), alone and in combination vs. placebo over 3 - 5 years (the 'parent study'). A sub-set of participants (n = 460) with end-of-treatment biopsies of normal-appearing rectal mucosa taken at 3- or 5-year follow-up colonoscopies is selected for this adjunct study. The aims of the proposed study are to 1) test the separate and joint effects of calcium and vitamin D supplementation on a custom panel of biomarkers of inflammation/immunomodulation (GM-CSF, IFN?, TNF¿, IL-6, IL-1¿, IL-4, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p40, and IL-17) representing different classes of inflammatory responses in patients with previous sporadic colorectal adenomas (n = 460); 2) obtain preliminary data on the effects of supplementation with calcium and vitamin D alone or in combination on biomarkers of colonic permeability (specific IgG and IgA to lipopolysaccharide [LPS] and flagellin) (n = 120); and 3) obtain preliminary data on whether changes in the biomarker levels are associated with decreased sporadic colorectal adenoma recurrence. The proposed scope of work is limited to laboratory and statistical analyses using biological samples and questionnaire data from the 'parent study'.  This adjunct study offers a unique, cost-effective opportunity in a large, ongoing trial in humans to 1) confirm anti-inflammatory effects of calcium and vitamin D in humans; 2) explore a novel hypothesis that calcium and vitamin D beneficially modulate colonic permeability; 3) elucidate the combined effects of calcium and vitamin D on biomarkers of inflammation; and 4) as a secondary objective, obtain preliminary data on whether modulation of these biomarkers predicts preventing sporadic colorectal adenoma recurrence.

Mentor: Dr. Ravi Thadhani is a world-renowned clinical investigator with extensive mentorship experience. Dr. Thadhani will ensure the success of Dr. Isakova's training, proposed studies and career development. Research: Secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT) is a common and early complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) that is associated with bone and cardiovascular disease and mortality. While the factors that maintain increased levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in advanced CKD are well established, the pathophysiological triggers that initiate increased PTH secretion in early CKD are less clear. Data from our group demonstrated that normocalcemic patients with early CKD developed subtle but significant reductions in serum calcium levels in the postprandial state. The relative hypocalcemia followed an increase in calciuria and was associated with a subsequent increase in postprandial PTH levels. Importantly, fasting PTH levels were not significantly increased in these patients; differences in PTH physiology between CKD and controls were detectable only in the postprandial 'stressed' state. Thus, we hypothesize that postprandial calciuria with episodic, relative hypocalcemia is a previously unreported initiating factor in the pathogenesis of sHPT in early CKD. In the current proposal we will explore this novel hypothesis in a series of human physiological studies and assess the relevance of the physiologic mechanisms at the population level in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC), a large established cohort of CKD patients. In Aim 1, we will examine the PTH secretory pattern in CKD and its relationship with calciuria, calcemia and dietary calcium intake in response to 3 separate meals over the course of 24-hours to test whether there is a 'stacking' effect from meal to meal on increased PTH secretion. In Aim 2A, we will increase separately the meal protein and sodium contents in order to test whether greater calciuria following high protein and sodium meals is associated with worsening hypocalcemia and greater PTH elevation in CKD. In Aim 2B, we will test whether augmenting dietary calcium intake or its absorption using calcitriol will blunt the postprandial hypocalcemia and thus prevent subsequent increases in PTH secretion. In Aim 3, we will examine in CRIC the effects of dietary sodium, calcium, phosphorus and protein, and therapy with diuretics on PTH levels and the risk of developing sHPT in CKD. We believe the results of these studies will provide important insights into novel mechanisms of sHPT in early CKD and lead to improved diagnosis and management of early-stage CKD patients. A K23 award will allow Dr. Isakova to attain new skills in clinical investigation and develop into an independent clinical investigator.      "," The long term goal of this proposal is to improve the lives of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) by studying the mechanisms for development of secondary hyperparathyroidism in CKD. Our results will provide new insights into the initiation of this hormone problem in CKD and guide new treatments to improve clinical outcomes for patients with CKD.         ",

The long-term goal of this project is to determine whether maternal folic acid supplementation during pregnancy increases the risk of early childhood asthma and atopy. Supplementation with folic acid, synthetic folate, is recommended during the periconceptional period to prevent neural tube defects (NTD). Studies in different populations have suggested an association between reported folic acid supplementation during pregnancy and increased risk of infant lower respiratory tract infection and early childhood asthma, but data are limited. While adequate intake of folate is essential for prevention of NTDs, it is important to delineate the impact of supplementation on the risk of common respiratory and atopic diseases. Folate plays an important role in DNA methylation, a regulator of gene expression. A causal relationship between folic acid supplementation and respiratory outcomes in children has not been established. However, this relationship does have some biologic plausibility. In a pregnant mouse model, a diet high in methyl donors, including folate, resulted in an augmented allergic phenotype in the offspring, as seen in asthma.  Opportunity and Impact. There is no primary prevention strategy for atopic diseases such as asthma. Our objective is to determine whether higher maternal folate intake or the timing of this intake increases the risk of wheezing, asthma, and other atopic diseases in children. This collective work will characterize maternal folate status using objective measures and will assess childhood wheezing, asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis using validated tools and objective measures. This will be the first investigation in a country with a national fortification program, where individuals may have high intake of folic acid from the diet.  Approach. This work will use complementary retrospective and prospective cohorts of mother-child pairs. Specific aim #1 will investigate the population-based incidence of wheezing and asthma during the first 6 years of life, by the timing of folic acid containing prescriptions filled during pregnancy in a retrospective cohort of 80,000 mother-child dyads from the Tennessee Medicaid population. Specific Aim #2 will determine if a) measured maternal plasma folate levels or b) reported folate intake is associated with prospective development of wheezing, asthma, and/or atopy in the first 5 years of life in mother-child dyads enrolled in the Conditions Affecting Neurocognitive Development and Learning in Early Childhood (CANDLE) cohort.  Innovation and Sustainability. This innovative, cost-efficient project will have the advantages of 1) a well-characterized retrospective cohort with a large number of mother-child dyads and determination of folic acid prescriptions filled by month of pregnancy and 2) a prospective cohort that includes the rich, existing infrastructure of the CANDLE cohort with maternal and infant biospecimens, nutritional data, and prospective follow-up using validated tools and objective measures to assess respiratory and atopic outcomes.

The study builds on extensive epidemiological and experimental data indicating that both vitamin D and calcium have anti-neoplastic effects in the large bowel and that these agents interact, each requiring the other for full effect. Despite the strong supporting  data, randomized trials are needed to confirm the purported efficacy of vitamin D, clarify its persistence, and assess the possible interaction with calcium. Experience with previous candidate chemopreventive agents for large bowel neoplasia shows that observation of a single colonoscopic surveillance cycle provides an incomplete evaluation of efficacy. Some agents have shown maximal effects only with longer follow-up; others have shown 'rebound' increases in adenoma risk after treatment ends.  Eligible subjects for the trial had a recent adenoma and no known polyps remaining in the large bowel. A total of 2259 subjects have been randomized to calcium carbonate (1200 mg calcium/day), vitamin D (1000 IU/day), both agents, or placebo. Women were offered the choice of being randomized to calcium alone or calcium plus vitamin D. Colonoscopic follow-up is either 3 years or 5 years after the qualifying exam, as planned by each subject's gastroenterologist. The main endpoint of the study is one or more neoplastic polyps of the bowel on follow-up; advanced lesions and multiple lesions are secondary endpoints. After completion of study treatment, subjects are followed for one subsequent colonoscopic surveillance cycle.  The study has successfully met its milestones during the first 10 years of funding. Enrollment proceeded according to schedule and subjects have shown very good compliance with study procedures and agents. Recruitment into the post-treatment follow-up has been excellent.  We now request funds for the final phases of the study: completion of treatment for a few subjects, post- treatment follow-up, and analyses of on-treatment and post-treatment adenoma occurrence.  In our main analyses, we will assess the effect of vitamin D alone vs. placebo and that of vitamin D + calcium vs. calcium alone and also test whether there is a 'rebound' in adenoma risk after cessation of vitamin D treatment. Under conservative assumptions, we will have greater than 95% power to detect a 20% reduction in adenoma recurrence with vitamin D vs. placebo, 89% power to detect a 25% reduction with calcium plus vitamin D vs. calcium alone and 80% power to reject a non-inferiority hypothesis regarding vitamin D vs. placebo, with an inferiority margin of 0.065 during post-treatment follow-up.

While much research has focused on the dysmorphological and neurological features of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), there is a critical gap in the literature with regard to our understanding of the nutritional and immunological mechanisms whereby postnatal growth and performance deficits in children affected by alcohol are initiated and subsequently persist throughout childhood, and therefore might be targets for postnatal intervention. Based on preliminary data from an ongoing clinical trial in Ukraine, conducted in a sample of moderate to heavy alcohol-consuming pregnant women, a multimicronutrient supplementation (multiple-vitamin-mineral supplement with or without additional choline) given during pregnancy is associated with a marked reduction of alcohol-related growth and neurocognitive deficits in infants at 6 and 12 months of age. These promising initial findings could have worldwide public health impact if demonstrated to persist. The primary goal of the current application is to investigate the persistence of the beneficial effects of multimicronutrient supplementation on growth and development through preschool age in an established longitudinal sample of children in Ukraine. Secondary goals of this application are to evaluate postnatal factors, including nutritional status of the child and marker of immune function and oxidative stress, that may contribute to persistent deficits among alcohol-exposed children in the context of prenatal nutritional factors. The proposed study will build on the strengths of an established Ukrainian cohort of well- characterized children, now between 2 and 5 years of age: a) to assess the impact of known prenatal alcohol exposure, with or without a past prenatal nutritional intervention, on the child's growth and neurobehavioral function through 5 years of age, and b) to determine the antecedents of an alcohol-affected child's postnatal nutritional and immunologic status and the contribution of this postnatal environment to persistent neurobehavioral and growth deficits.

Anemia which does not respond to treatment with erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA) is common in clinical practice. Much evidence points to adverse health effects associated with escalation of ESA therapy in CKD patients with treatment resistant anemia. However, little progress has been made toward identifying other mechanisms which contribute to anemia in CKD in order to identify safe and effective adjunctive treatments. Hepcidin, an anti-microbial peptide produced by the liver, whose production is stimulated by inflammation, interferes with the utilization of iron stores for erythropoiesis. The specific contribution of hepcidin to the development of anemia in children with CKD has not been explored in a prospective manner. In addition, emerging evidence suggests that 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25D) deficiency is a novel risk factor for anemia in CKD, which may be due to 25D-dependent immunomodulation. Interruption of the inflammatory stimuli which increase hepcidin production could make the management of CKD-associated anemia with iron supplementation and ESAs more effective. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to define the contribution of hepcidin mediated mechanisms to the anemia of early CKD, and to understand whether hepcidin production may be modified by a therapeutic intervention. The Specific Aims of this project are to (1) define how elevated serum levels of hepcidin are associated with hemoglobin and ESA hypo-responsiveness within the established NIH funded Chronic Kidney Disease in Children (CKiD) prospective cohort study, and (2) to evaluate the effects of ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) supplementation on serum levels of hepcidin, hemoglobin, and ESA dose in a prospective interventional trial in children with pre-dialysis CKD. Our central hypothesis is that in mild to moderate CKD, elevated serum hepcidin is associated with anemia (as defined by low hemoglobin). Furthermore, we hypothesize that in the setting of CKD, supplementation with ergocalciferol will be associated with a decrease in serum hepcidin and increase in hemoglobin. Our hypotheses have been formulated on the basis of an extensive review of the literature on vitamin D, hepcidin and anemia, and our own preliminary data produced by measuring serum hepcidin values in 124 children enrolled in CKiD, in whom higher hepdidin levels are associated with anemia, and preliminary study of normal children showing low 25D levels associated with anemia. The rationale for the combination of observational and interventional approaches proposed is to accelerate our understanding of the biologic mechanisms contributing to the anemia of CKD and simultaneously to develop new and innovative interventions to treat this common co-morbidity in childhood CKD.      "," Anemia affects more than half of the over 10 million Americans with chronic kidney disease (CKD), and is associated with poor health outcomes including heart disease and death. Anemia in CKD is often resistant to current treatments, suggesting that there may be other causes of anemia in CKD that have yet to be identified. Definition of the relative contributions of specific pathways to anemia in CKD will identify future treatments for this anemia, with the long term goal of improving quality of life, and decreasing both overall illness and the cost of anemia treatment in the CKD population.

The VITAL trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial specifically designed to evaluate the efficacy of vitamin D and marine omega-3 fatty acid supplements in the primary prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD) among 20,000 U.S. men and women. We will test the hypothesis that vitamin D or omega-3 supplementation reduces the risk of T2D among initially non-diabetic subjects participating in the trial. We will further assess whether and to what extent vitamin D or omega-3 supplementation improves glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity/secretion in a subset of the cohort undergoing biomarker evaluation for these endpoints. Hence, we propose a cost-effective strategy to evaluate the efficacy of the study interventions for diabetes prevention as well as to provide detailed characterization of the physiologic mechanisms that may impart this benefit. Case validation of incident T2D will require collection of detailed diagnostic information from medical record review and/or supplementary questionnaires completed by the participants' physicians. To complement case validation, additional data on diabetes diagnoses and hypoglycemic medication will be retrieved by linking the trial participants with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) database. In our substudy, 1,000 participants without a report of diabetes at baseline recruited at four Clinical and Translational Science Center (CTSC) sites across the U.S. (Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, and Houston) will undergo a standard 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at baseline (pre- randomization) and at 2 years of follow-up (matched for season, by month). Serial measurements of insulin and glucose homeostasis will thereby be ascertained. Glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) will also be measured. In summary, we believe that the research infrastructure of the parent VITAL trial will offer us a unique cost-effective opportunity to answer important and timely questions about potential benefits of vitamin D or omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in the prevention of T2D, as well as to identify potential risks. In this proposed ancillary study, we request funds to perform diabetes case validation in the VITAL cohort and serial glucose tolerance testing at baseline and follow-up in a subsample.

"," Existing biologic and observational evidence strongly supports potential health benefits of vitamin D and marine omega-3 fatty acids in preventing type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, due to lack of definitive data from large-scale clinical trials, it remains unclear whether T2D can be delayed or prevented by use of these supplements.           ",

It is predictive of breast cancer risk for at least 10 years in the futue and has been suggested as a surrogate marker of breast cancer risk. Several states now mandate release of mammographic density data to women. However, except for anti-hormonal therapies (e.g., tamoxifen), no interventions have been proven to reduce breast density. Thus, testing promising, well-tolerated interventions that might affect mammographic density is of substantial interest. Several lines of evidence suggest that vitamin D may play a role in breast density and breast carcinogenesis. Vitamin D reduces proliferation and promotes differentiation and apoptosis in breast cells in culture. However, no large-scale randomized studies have examined the impact of vitamin D on mammographic density. We propose to examine the randomized effects vitamin D3 on mammographic breast density in the NIH sponsored VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL), an ongoing randomized, double blind, trial testing vitamin D3 (2,000 IU/day cholecalciferol) and omega-3 fatty acids (840 mg eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA]+ docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) in the primary prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease in a multi-ethnic population of over 24,000 men and women.

Identifying well-tolerated, promising nutritional agents that could reduce breast density would have important public health implications for women at high risk of breast cancer.               ",

Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) has a high morbidity and mortality. In VA Cooperative Studies in which liver biopsies were performed, only 35% of patients with AH and underlying cirrhosis, and 60% of those with AH alone (no cirrhosis) were alive at the end of four years, with most deaths occurring early in the study. There is no FDA-approved therapy for any stage of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). The most widely-used (off-label) drug therapies for AH are glucocorticoids and pentoxifylline. Both agents have anti-inflammatory activities and downregulate proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Unfortunately, an important subset of AH patients treated with glucocorticoids have 'steroid resistance', and some patients have contraindications to steroid therapy. Studies on pentoxifylline in AH are limited, and efficacy appears highest in preventing/treating the hepatorenal syndrome. Thus, new therapies as well as a better understanding of mechanisms/biomarkers for severity of disease and response to therapy are necessary. Our research team has been a leader in defining mechanisms of alcohol-induced liver injury using in vitro and animal models of ALD, and in translating basic findings into the clinical setting. Our group is the first to describe dysregulated cytokine metabolism in AH. We have a long-standing interest in mechanisms of inflammation and liver injury. We also have extensive experience in the gut-liver axis and AH, as well as in the development of novel therapies for AH.!!Building on the above translational research strengths of our program which focus on the gut-liver axis and inflammation in ALD, we propose three highly translational Specific Aims, which all relate to and utilize samples from our proposed UO1 clinical trial. Aim 1 will evaluate novel mechanisms for alcohol-induced alterations in gut integriy leading to endotoxemia and AH. We will study the therapeutic efficacy of both live probiotics and probiotic supernatants. Aim 2 will study the role of specific PDE4 inhibition in AH using animal models and our AH clinical patient population. There are recent data in the pulmonary literature showing that specific PDE4 inhibitors are effective in steroid resistant patients which may translate to AH. Lastly, Aim 3 evaluates mechanisms for steroid resistance using both specimens from patients in our clinical trial and in vitro data. All three of our specific aims utiize specimens obtained from our U01 clinical trial, and our protocol interacts with the two other translational protocols in our U01 consortium. Our goal is not only to better understand mechanisms for AH, but also to develop new therapies (including those already available for other diseases) for AH, either immediately transforming clinical practice or providing novel therapies for our clinical trial consortium.        "," This is a translational application portion of an overall UO1 application. Our goal is not only to better understand mechanisms for AH, but also to develop new therapies (including those already available for other diseases) for AH.                ",

The underlying mechanism of salt-sensitivity is not fully understood. The overall objective of the proposed study is to investigate the association of urinary excretion of angiotensinogen (AGT), kallikrein, dopamine, norepinephrine, and albumin with salt-sensitivity and potassium-sensitivity of BP and risk of hypertension. The Genetic Epidemiology Network of Salt Sensitivity (GenSalt) is an NHLBI-sponsored dietary feeding-study conducted among 1,906 participants living in rural China during October 2003-July 2005. The dietary interventions included a 7-day low-sodium feeding (51.3 mmol/day), a 7-day high-sodium feeding (307.8 mmol/day), and a 7-day high-sodium feeding with oral potassium supplementation (60 mmol/day). BP measurements were obtained on each of 3 days during the baseline and each of the 3 intervention periods. Two follow-up examinations to investigate the incidence of hypertension were conducted in the GenSalt study participants during August 2008-December 2009 and August 2011-May 2012. The GenSalt-replication study was conducted among 698 participants living in the same region using an identical study protocol from April to November of 2010. The GenSalt and GenSalt-replication studies with high quality data and sufficient biosamples provide a unique opportunity for the following specific aims: 1. to investigate the association of urinary excretion of AGT, kallikrein, dopamine, norepinephrine, and albumin with salt- and potassium- sensitivity of BP, and 2. to study the prospective association of urinary excretion of AGT, kallikrein, dopamine, norepinephrine, and albumin with subsequent incidence of hypertension. To achieve these specific aims, we will measure urinary AGT, kallikrein, dopamine, norepinephrine, and albumin in the frozen-stored 24-hour urinary samples from the GenSalt and GenSalt-replication study participants; analyze the association of urinary excretion of biomarkers at baseline and during dietary interventions with BP responses to dietary sodium and potassium interventions in 2,604 GenSalt and GenSalt-replication study participants; and analyze the prospective relationship of urinary excretion of biomarkers at baseline and during dietary interventions with subsequent risk of hypertension in 1,906 GenSalt study participants with follow-up data on BP. The proposed study is very timely and cost-effective, because it uses the rich resources and research infrastructure of the GenSalt study. This study will be the first large investigation to examine the association between multiple urinary biomarkers and risk of salt-sensitive hypertension. The findings from this study may provide novel insights into the underlying biologic mechanisms of salt-sensitivity and potassium-sensitivity of BP.

Once established, AF is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and current treatment options are associated with limited long term success rates and significant risks. In this application, we propose to evaluate the balance of benefits and risks of marine omega-3 fatty acid (840 mg eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] + docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) and vitamin D3 (2,000 IU/day cholecalciferol) on AF incidence in the setting of an NIH-funded large-scale clinical trial, the Vitamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL). VITAL is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2x2 factorial trial specifically designed to evaluate the efficacy of vitamin D3 and marine omega-3 fatty acid supplements in the primary prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease among 20,000 men (aged 50+ years) and women (aged 55+ years). Based upon data in cellular, animal, and human studies, both of the study agents have the potential to influence arrhythmic risk in general and AF risk specifically, both positively and negatively. However, definitive data from randomized trials are lacking, particularly with respect to primary prevention. In this application, we propose an ancillary study to ascertain and adjudicate AF outcomes for the primary aim of testing whether omega-3 fatty acid and/or vitamin D3 supplementation influences AF risk in an older population, where the incidence of AF is growing substantially. Case validation of incident AF will involve systematic ascertainment of physician diagnoses of AF on annual study questionnaires supplemented by CMS linkage followed by collection of detailed diagnostic information from outpatient and inpatient medical records. An endpoint committee composed of cardiologists will confirm incident AF events based on medical record review. As a secondary aim of the proposal, electrocardiograms will also be obtained at baseline and again after two years of treatment and follow-up among a sub-cohort of 1000 patients evaluated at the VITAL Clinical and Translational Science Center to assess whether and to what extent vitamin D3 or omega-3 supplementation might impact electrocardiographic parameters, which could serve as intermediate phenotypes for heart rhythm disorders. To address tertiary aims, detailed information on timing and mechanism of death will also be collected in the entire cohort to explore treatment effects on arrhythmic death, and EPA/DHA along with 25(OH) vitamin D levels will be measured in baseline blood samples in a nested case-cohort design to explore if baseline levels modify treatment effects on AF incidence. In summary, we propose a timely and cost-effective strategy that takes advantage of the enormous investment of resources and infrastructure in the VITAL trial to provide much needed data on the summation of benefits and risks of these agents on AF incidence as well as other arrhythmic endpoints. If either agent significantly lowers AF risk, then these agents would represent one of the first therapies proven effective for the primary prevention of this growing morbid disease.        ","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained heart rhythm disturbance and accounts for approximately 15% of strokes and is associated with doubling of mortality. Once established, atrial fibrillation is difficult to treat; and therefore, research directed at prevention of atrial fibrillation is essential. Existing biologic and observational evidence supports potential health benefits of marine omega-3 fatty acids and Vitamin D which might prevent atrial fibrillation. However, due to lack of definitive data from large-scale clinical trials, it remains unclear whether AF can be delayed or prevented by use of these supplements. Findings from this proposed study conducted within a large clinical trial will clarify whether vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid supplementation reduces risk of developing AF and provide important data that will be applicable to public health and clinical guidelines for AF prevention.

Most intervention studies have excluded African Americans because of the erroneous belief that osteoporosis is not a major health problem in this population. Although the risk of osteoporotic fractures in black women is only about half the risk in white women, the risk triples in both groups between the ages of 50 and 80. Since longevity is increasing in the black population, osteoporotic fractures will become an even greater problem for this ethnic minority in the future. The elderly require higher intake of vitamin D to prevent bone loss resulting from secondary hyperparathyroidism. Calcium with sufficient vitamin D supplementation decreases fractures in elderly white populations as a result of reduction in bone loss and falls (improved physical performance). The only fracture intervention study to include African Americans-the Women's Health Initiative-used an inadequate dose of vitamin D, a dose unlikely to achieve the vitamin D status proposed by U.S. experts: serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration above 75 nmol/L. No calcium/vitamin D intervention studies on fall prevention or physical performance have included African Americans. As a result of increased skin pigmentation, blacks synthesize less vitamin D from sun exposure. As a result, serum 25(OH)D levels are often in the 'insufficient' range. This is accompanied by secondary hyperparathyroidism, but adult blacks have a relative skeletal resistance to PTH. Addition of vitamin D3 to a calcium- sufficient African American postmenopausal population does not prevent bone loss. The calcium/vitamin D requirements of black adults may be lower than white adults through midlife. However, the elderly require more vitamin D to produce the higher 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D levels required to overcome the hyperparathyroidism associated with aging. Bone loss accelerates and bone turnover markers increase in elderly African Americans just as in whites. The specific aims of this project are to determine if dietary supplementation with calcium/vitamin D will safely reduce bone loss and bone turnover and improve physical performance in elderly African Americans. We will enroll 250 African American women in a four-year vitamin D3 intervention trial where serum 25(OH)D will be maintained at an optimum level above 75 nmol/L. Adequate calcium intake will be ensured. Functional markers of vitamin D including bone density, serum PTH, and bone turnover will be measured. The NIH Conference on Vitamin D and Health (September, 2007) concluded that research in this population is a high priority. It is essential to learn whether elderly blacks benefit from increased vitamin D intake, since these individuals would tend to receive higher doses of vitamin D than whites to compensate for lower baseline 25(OH)D levels, exposing them to potential harm without a compensatory benefit.

While vitamin D supplementation in the animal model of MS improves clinical outcomes, well-designed studies in humans are lacking. A vitamin D response element was recently identified in the promoter region of HLA-DRB1*15, the gene believed to be critical to initiating the autoimmune response in MS, and vitamin D increases the expression of the gene in vitro. These findings suggest that vitamin D supplementation could even be harmful in established MS. While physician groups are beginning to advocate for widespread vitamin D supplementation, the most appropriate vitamin D dose is not known. Patients with MS who receive oral vitamin D supplementation may not attain the expected increase in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels, and a polymorphism in a key enzyme in vitamin D metabolism is associated with increased MS risk, suggesting potential pharmacokinetic differences. We propose to capitalize on a large, extant MS cohort with prospectively-collected clinical and imaging data acquired annually for five years to determine if vitamin D status is associated with subsequent clinical or brain MRI evidence of increased inflammatory activity or accelerated neurodegeneration, two key pathologic processes in MS. We will also conduct a pilot study of vitamin D supplementation to assess if the pharmacokinetic or immunologic response differs in MS patients and healthy subjects. Finally, we will evaluate the association of vitamin D levels and supplementation with the expression of HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DRB5, which have been correlated with MS phenotype. This feasible and cost-effective project will provide rationale for future mechanistic studies of vitamin D in MS and for well-designed clinical trials. MS is a complex chronic neurologic disease, the study of which requires the integration of many disciplines. My career development plan includes training in advanced biostatistics and epidemiology, nutrition, immunology, genetics and neuroimaging, all of which I need to establish myself as an independent clinical researcher in MS. My long-term goal is to integrate these disciplines to identify modifiable environmental prognostic factors in MS and to explore the mechanisms by which they influence its course. The MS program at the University of California, San Francisco consists of a collaborative network of clinical, neuroimaging, genetics, and immunology researchers who will provide a rich environment in which I will conduct the proposed career development and research plans.      "," Multiple sclerosis affects at least 400,000 people in the United States lone and is a major cause of neurologic disability in young adults.

Diabetes population and related costs are expected to at least double in the next quarter century, as more than 80 million Americans are at risk of developing t2DM. In clinical trials, pharmacotherapy as an adjust to lifestyle changes has been successful for treating t2DM, nonetheless adherence is often poor and drug-related costs are escalating; therefore, identification of alternative therapeutic options that can be applied at the public healh level is urgently needed to decrease t2DM-related burden. Based on NIH-funded research from our group and others, suboptimal vitamin D status has emerged as a potential contributor to the pathophysiology of t2DM. However, because of potential confounding in observational studies and lack of data from adequately powered trials designed for glycemic and other metabolic outcomes, it remains unclear whether vitamin D has a clinical role in patients with established t2DM. The goal of this renewal application for a New Investigator R01, which directly extends our work in this area conducted during the first funding cycle, is to evaluate whether vitamin D is  an effective non-pharmacologic nutritional intervention for t2DM. The central hypothesis is that suboptimal vitamin D status worsens glycemia in t2DM and that raising one's 25OHD concentration with vitamin D supplementation improves glycemia and other metabolic outcomes in patients with established t2DM, through improvements in insulin secretion and sensitivity. A secondary hypothesis is that the effect of vitamin D is modified by specific Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) polymorphisms. We plan to test our central hypothesis and accomplish the goals of this application by conducting a 1-year long randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D3 supplementation in persons with established t2DM of mild/moderate severity. Declining vitamin D status is a consequence of our altered lifestyle and its strong association with t2DM, after adjusting for other lifestyle factors (weight, diet), makes the proposed study very important and timely and also consistent with national research priorities as the study is expected to fill a fundamental knowledge gap which fuels the current intense controversy in relation to the development of recommendations for vitamin D supplementation for non-skeletal medical conditions.          ","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance of the proposed project to public health: The proposed study addresses alternative therapeutic options for an important public health problem, type 2 diabetes. If the favorable association between vitamin D status and type 2 diabetes that have been reported in observational studies is confirmed in the clinically relevant trial, we propose, vitamin D can assume its proper role alongside established therapies to treat type 2 diabetes in the more than 26 million Americans with the disease. Relevance of the proposed project to the mission of the NIH (NIDDK and the Office of Dietary Supplements [ODS]): The research addresses important health issues of relevance to both NIDDK and ODS. Nutrition and type 2 diabetes are two obvious areas of interest to NIDDK while vitamin D is a nutrient of significant interest to ODS.

Despite enthusiasm for the use of vitamin D for bone health, there are limited data on the effects of high-dose vitamin D supplements vs. placebo on bone health and body composition outcomes. Previous data support a positive relationship between 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH) D] levels and bone mineral density (BMD). However, results from clinical trials that test vitamin D supplementation alone on areal BMD (aBMD) are sparse and inconsistent, and it is not known whether vitamin D can prevent or reverse the structural deterioration characteristic of osteoporosis. Recent advances in bone imaging make it possible to assess volumetric BMD (vBMD), structure, and micro- architecture non-invasively with high-resolution peripheral computed tomography (HR-pQCT). In addition, observational studies show an inverse relationship between 25(OH) D levels and body mass index (BMI). Since vitamin D is stored in fat, new dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measures of adiposity can advance understanding of this relationship and determine whether or not supplemental vitamin D has effects on body composition. We propose an ancillary study to the NIH-sponsored, Vitamin D and OmegA-3 Trial (VITAL) (U01 CA138962), an ongoing, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol, 2000 IU/d) and/or marine omega-3 fatty acids (1 gm/d) in 20,000 men and women, to test the effects of vitamin D3 on BMD, geometry, architecture, and body composition. In a sub-cohort of 600 participants recruited from the NIH-sponsored Clinical and Translational Science Center (CTSC) in Boston, we seek to test the following hypotheses, with measures at baseline and year 2: Aim 1: High-dose vitamin D3 will (a) produce small increases in aBMD at the spine, hip, forearm and total body, as assessed by DXA and (b) improve balance of bone remodeling through decreases in bone turnover; Aim 2: High-dose vitamin D3 will improve: vBMD and bone structure and architecture at the distal radius and tibia, as assessed by HR-pQCT and bone strength estimates; Aim 3: High-dose vitamin D3 will result in lower (a) total body fat and fat mass index (FMI-fat mass/height2) and/or b) regional fat measures, as assessed by DXA. For each Aim, we will determine whether effects vary with (a) baseline 25(OH) D levels, (b) gender, (c) race/skin pigmentation, and (d) BMI or FMI. We will also define how the 25(OH) D levels corresponding to high-dose vitamin D supplementation affects these bone health and body composition outcomes. In order to complete pre-randomization testing in this sub-cohort, it is critical that this ancillary study be undertaken during the CTSC baseline visits, which begin December, 2011 and extend to early 2013. The proposed studies will provide positive or informative negative results about effects of vitamin D3 alone on bone health and body composition, and enhance understanding of the skeletal mechanisms through which vitamin D may affect fracture outcomes evaluated in a separate study (AR060574). Findings from this proposal will fill gaps in knowledge and inform clinical and public health recommendations.         ","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purported health benefits of vitamin D are receiving wide attention in the medical literature and the popular press. While some data support a benefit of vitamin D on fracture reduction, there is no information on the effects of high-dose vitamin D on bone structure and architecture and the effects of adiposity on these relationships. Findings from these clinical studies including advanced imaging techniques will elucidate the role of vitamin D on bone mass, architecture and body composition in men and women enrolled in the VITAL study.",

Reducing AAP linked metabolic risks may help cut the 30 years of life lost within this population. Supplemental folate may be a cost effective and low risk method to reduce AAP CVD morbidity and mortality. Folate pharmacogenetics, allows us to mechanistically study AAP metabolic complications and develop personalized medicine within clinical practice. The objective of this project is to compare the effect of folate versus placebo on measures of the metabolic syndrome and CVD risk factors. We will evaluate metabolic laboratory components, and endothelial functioning, in schizophrenia patients receiving AAPs, taking into account pharmacogenetic differences related to folate metabolism. Our primary hypothesis is that folate will attenuate metabolic changes associated with AAP use, thereby contributing to improve endothelial functioning. Variation within the genes facilitating folate metabolism (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and catechol-o-methyl transferase (COMT)) modulate these improvements. We have formulated this hypothesis based on our pilot data obtained during R01MH082784 showing AAPs increase metabolic syndrome risk due to an interaction with MTHFR and COMT. We performed an open-label 3-month folate supplement trial and found significant reductions in metabolic measures and significantly reduced the number of subjects meeting endothelial dysfunction criteria. These improvements were modulated through MTHFR and COMT. The specific aims for this proposal are: 1) Evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness of folic acid supplementation (5mg/day) versus placebo for 16 weeks in schizophrenia subjects and measure sustainability of this effect 8 weeks after supplementation withdrawal, 2) Determine the role of MTHFR and COMT variants on endothelial functioning and metabolic improvements seen with folate supplementation. The innovative approach capitalizes upon a novel strategy to reduce AAP metabolic risks using a novel non-invasive endothelial functioning measurement as a biomarker. This allows for an overall CVD risk estimation compared to focusing on solely weight loss and glucose regulation. The inclusion of pharmacogenomics allows for potential innovative translation of personalized medicine outcomes into practice. Our expected outcomes will demonstrate folate's effectiveness in attenuating metabolic syndrome measures and improvements in endothelial functioning in AAP users with a randomized double blind longitudinal treatment design. Our follow up visit will allow for measurement of any sustained folate effects leading to future dose ranging studies. Successful completion of our pharmacogenetic analyses can be expected to provide a greater mechanistic understanding of AAP metabolic risks. The primary positive impact of our anticipated findings will be an evidence-based scientific framework for folate intervention development for AAP metabolic complications, which can be directly translated into clinical practice.        ","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health relevance of this proposed research is that its successful completion can be expected to provide a cost effective intervention that can be used to significantly reduce the risk of development of cardiovascular problems for patients taking antipsychotic medications to treat their serious mental illness. Ultimately this will help t markedly improve quality of life for such patients, significantly enhancing their expected life spa and reduce costs to the health care system.",

Smoking during pregnancy remains a major public health problem as at least 12% of pregnant women cannot quit smoking during pregnancy. This addiction is the largest preventable cause of childhood respiratory illness, including asthma, and children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy show lifetime decreases in pulmonary function. Smoking is a unique morbidity in that it is addictive, heavily advertised and recent genome studies show there are genotypes that significantly increase the likelihood of being unable to quit. Teen pregnancy, low income, low education, and living with another smoker are important factors increasing the odds of smoking during pregnancy. Pulmonary function tests done shortly after birth in babies born to mothers who smoked during pregnancy show decreased pulmonary function as measured by decreased respiratory flows and compliance and altered tidal breathing patterns. These changes can still be measured even after the infants have reached adulthood. Multiple epidemiologic studies show that these decreases in pulmonary function lead to increased respiratory disease and costs of hundreds of millions of dollars per year. The primary aim of this multi-site study is to demonstrate improved pulmonary function testing at 3 months of age, in infants delivered to smoking mothers who are randomized to 500 mg/day of supplemental vitamin C versus placebo prior to 22 weeks of pregnancy. Patients will meet with research personnel at each prenatal visit and smoking cessation will be actively encouraged. Patients will be monitored with a set of serial biomarkers to assess smoking and medication compliance, including urine cotinines levels, smoking questionnaires, pill counts and fasting plasma ascorbic acid levels. Pulmonary function tests will be done at 3 months of age and will measure forced expiratory flows. Success of this study is supported by strong pilot data from Dr. McEvoy's K23 showing statistically significant improvements in pulmonary function tests in infants born to smoking mothers who received vitamin C, and preliminary data showing a lower incidence of wheezing at 1 year of age in these infants. Key genetic polymorphisms shown to increase sensitivity to in utero smoke exposure will also be measured. The success of this study is also supported by animal models showing the effectiveness of vitamin C to preserve pulmonary function and genetic and epidemiologic studies linking the effects of smoking during pregnancy to oxidant mechanisms. Given nicotine's addictive nature, the underserved socio-economic nature of the patient population, and the constant advertising by tobacco companies, smoking during pregnancy will continue to adversely victimize millions of babies worldwide. This research has great public health significance to potentially alter the fetal origins of respiratory disease by blocking some of the effects of in-utero smoke exposure on lung development.

Changes in urinary excretion of NTX and nitrogen and in selected measures of lower extremity performance will be compared across the three groups. The safety and tolerability of the interventions will also be evaluated. This investigation should provide needed information on the appropriate dosing regimen and on the study population that should be enrolled in a future long-term bicarbonate intervention trial to assess the long-term effects of this simple, low cost intervention on important clinical outcomes including rates of loss in bone and muscle mass, falls, and fractures.      ","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  With aging, men and women develop a mild and progressive metabolic acidosis. This occurs as a result of declining renal function and ingestion of acid-producing diets. There is extensive evidence that severe metabolic acidosis causes bone and muscle loss, but the impact of the chronic, mild acidosis on bone and muscle in older individuals has not been established. In our recently completed NIH-funded trial in 171 older men and women, alkalinizing the diet with a bicarbonate supplement daily for 3 months significantly reduced urinary excretion of N-telopeptide (NTX), a marker of bone resorption, and urinary nitrogen, a marker of muscle wasting. Moreover, bicarbonate supplements significantly improved muscle performance in the women. These and other data support a potential role for bicarbonate as a means of reducing the musculoskeletal declines that lead to extensive morbidity and mortality in the elderly. Before proceeding to a long-term bicarbonate intervention study, however, it is important to identify the dose of bicarbonate most likely to be optimal and to characterize the subjects who benefit most from it. The proposed dose-finding study will extend our previous work in this area by evaluating the effects of placebo and two doses of bicarbonate on urinary NTX and nitrogen excretion and on lower extremity performance. The lowest dose we plan to test is similar to the dose shown in our recent trial to be effective. The proposed study is a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial in which 138 men and 138 women, age 60 and older, will take potassium bicarbonate in doses of 1.0 or 1.5 mmol/kg of body weight or placebo daily for three months.

The safety and tolerability of the interventions will also be evaluated. This investigation should provide needed information on the appropriate dosing regimen and on the study population that should be enrolled in a future long-term bicarbonate intervention trial to assess the long-term effects of this simple, low cost intervention on important clinical outcomes including rates of loss in bone and muscle mass, falls, and fractures.

Despite over 40 years of research on AH, there is still no FDA approved treatment for this disease. The most commonly used off-label drugs for AH are corticosteroids and pentoxifylline. Unfortunately, even patients with AH treated with corticosteroids have a 6 month mortality of 40%. These poor clinical outcomes are due, in large part, to an incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of alcohol-mediated liver injury. Therefore, there is an urgent need for effective new therapies for this pernicious disease. This multicenter study will be a collaborative effort of four medical centers (Cleveland Clinic, University of Louisville, UT Southwestern, and University of Massachusetts) with its ultimate goal of transforming the clinical treatment of AH by rapidly translating novel and innovative basic science discoveries into clinical practice. In the first 2.5 years of the grant, two clinical trials will test the hypohesis that disruption of the normal gut-barrier function, over-activation of the inflammatory cascade, and innate immune activation are the primary elements of the complex pathogenesis of AH. In patients with severe AH, the first trial will compare a novel drug combination of anakinra (an inhibitor of IL-1 activity), pentoxifylline (a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that suppresses the inflammatory cytokine cascade), and zinc (which improves gut-barrier function) with the current standard of care therapy of treatment with corticosteroids. The second trial will compare probiotics (to improve gut-barrier function) to placebo in patients with moderate AH. The primary outcomes of both clinical trials will be 6 month mortality. Both trials will also supply specimens o the translational/basic science components of this UO1 consortium to identify novel biomarkers and altered pharmacogenetics that predict disease severity and response to pharmacologic therapy as well as to identify unique drug targets for novel treatments for AH. These new discoveries will then be translated rapidly to clinical testing in the last 2.5 years of the grant.A biorepository of the collected clinical data and patient samples will also be established that will be an important national resource for transforming clinical practice for the treatment of AH.        "," Specific Aims: Our studies will test the hypothesis that the syndrome of acute alcoholic hepatitis (AAH) results from severe inflammation and dysregulated cytokines, providing the 'second hit' that causes an acute deterioration. We further hypothesize that gut derived endotoxins and other bacterial products trigger inflammation and are a consequence of increased permeability with altered gut barrier function. Steroid monotherapy is not effective in all patients with AAH. Consequently, our studies will utilize compounds that have the potential to improve gut barrier function (both in moderate and severe disease) AND to reduce the associated inflammation (severe disease) AND to prevent the development of hepatorenal syndrome and other organ failure (severe disease). We will utilize published models for predicting mortality in patients with AAH to stratify patients based on severity. Although previous studies of treatment for severe AAH utilized 30-day mortality as an endpoint, 6- month mortality is a more relevant outcome, in part because most transplantation programs require 6 months of abstinence before active listing. Furthermore, the number of deaths between 6 and12 months in abstinent patients is low compared to the number in the first 6 months. Patients will be stratified into those with Model of End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score < 21 and MELD > 21. The primary difference between the Maddrey discriminant function (DF) and the MELD is that the latter includes creatinine. We propose to use the MELD score to stratify for severity but require that patients in the severe group also have a DF > 32, to avoid including patients with chronic kidney disease, not hepatorenal syndrome. Aim 1: Evaluate the effects of corticosteroids versus a combination of interleukin-1 inhibitor plus pentoxifylline plus zinc supplements in patients with MELD > 21. Patients will be randomized to receive 28 days of prednisolone 40 mg daily OR therapy that includes a combination of anakinra (interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, IL-1 RA) 100mg by subcutaneous injection daily for 14 days PLUS pentoxifylline 400 mg p.o. three times daily for one month PLUS zinc supplements (220 mg of zinc sulfate) given orally for 6 months. This combination strategy will treat the acute inflammatory component of the disease (anakinra) and protect against development of hepatorenal syndrome (pentoxifylline), one of the most frequent causes of death in severe AAH. Gut mucosal integrity will be restored (zinc supplements), a critical component in preventing repeated episodes of AAH. The primary outcome will be 6 month mortality rate. Secondary outcomes will be measured at 30, 90 and 180 days. They include change in gut mucosal permeability; changes in the levels of serum endotoxin, IL-1, tumor necrosis factor-a (TNFa) and other cytokines from baseline; mortality; and change in MELD score. Aim 2: Evaluate the effects of probiotic supplements on improvement in MELD score and gut mucosal integrity in patients with MELD < 21. Patients will be randomized to receive daily probiotics for 6 months and standard of care treatment or placebo with standard care (described below). Primary outcome will be change in MELD score at 30 days after randomization. Secondary outcomes will be measured at 30, 90 and 180 days. These include improvement in MELD score, gut mucosal permeability, liver enzymes, serum endotoxin and the levels of TNF and other cytokines from baseline; and mortality. Aim 3: Develop new clinical trials for patients with alcoholic hepatitis using lead compounds identified by the translational science components of the U-01 consortium. Results of translational studies being conducted at 3 of the sites will be reviewed twice yearly by the Executive Committee to determine which compounds are most promising and safest for inclusion in pilot studies in subsequent years of the project. The study design will employ stratification according to MELD unless other parameters that are being measured (genotyping, cytokine profiles, etc.) prove to be more promising. Aim 4: Create a data and tissue biorepository. This biorepository will serve as a national resource for all studies related to acute alcoholic hepatitis. Our research group will use the samples and share with others for future studies on biomarkers for AAH severity/outcome, cost analysis, rationales for new therapies, etc.  ",

We propose to initiate a substudy of cognitive decline (VITAL-Cog) among 3000 participants aged 65+years, including 1000 African-Americans. This is an exciting opportunity to conduct a large and highly cost-effective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled 2x2 factorial trial of vitamin D (vitamin D3 [cholecalciferol], 2000 IU/day) and marine omega-3 fatty acid (docosahexaenoic acid + eicosapentaenoic acid, 1000 mg/day) supplements for slowing cognitive decline. Data from laboratory studies, epidemiologic research, small primary prevention trials, and/or large secondary prevention trials suggest that these nutritional agents may reduce cognitive decline, but large trials among a generally healthy aging population are lacking. Growing public enthusiasm for supplemental vitamin D as well as fish oil underscores the urgent need for a timely initiation of such a trial, before their use becomes sufficiently prevalent (through supplements and food fortification). VITAL participants will be recruited from the general population by mail among health and other professionals, members of AARP, subscribers to Essence magazine, and others; African-Americans will be oversampled, as they have a higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. Respondents will be enrolled in a 3-month placebo run-in phase to test participation. We propose to administer baseline telephone cognitive testing during the run-in period, permitting a pre-randomization assessment. The telephone cognitive battery will include 7 tests of general cognition, verbal memory, and executive function (we have extensive experience with telephone cognitive testing, and the battery will be validated in 300 VITAL-Cog participants with in-person cognitive tests). At the end of the run-in, those who remain willing and eligible and who report having taken at least two-thirds of the pills, will be randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups for 4.5 years. Blood samples will be collected to allow assessment of effect modification by baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D, omega-3 fatty acid levels, as well as by apolipoprotein E4 status. At 1-year intervals, participants will receive a new supply of pills and a follow-up questionnaire on compliance, possible side effects and medical history. At 1.5 to 2-year intervals, VITAL-cog participants will receive follow-up cognitive function assessments, for a total of 3 assessments over the 4.5 years; participants in the 10th percentile of worst decline will also receive telephone informant interviews using the Dementia Questionnaire. Given our success with prior telephone based cognitive function assessments in multiple trial settings, we believe VITAL-cog will be able to provide definitive results regarding the study hypotheses. To complete pre-randomization assessment of cognitive function, it is critical that VITAL-Cog be undertaken in parallel to the placebo run-in period for the parent trial (1 U01 CA138962), which is scheduled to begin in April 2010.      ","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Given the projected aging of the population, maintaining cognitive function into older ages is of major public health importance, and early interventions may be most effective. The VITAL (VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL) study was recently funded and will begin recruitment in January 2010 to investigate the effects of vitamin D and marine omega-3 fatty acid supplements on heart health and cancer prevention.

Her research is focused on the extra-skeletal actions of vitamin D and the unique challenges of managing vitamin D deficiency in patients with glomerular diseases complicated by nephrotic-range proteinuria. Vitamin D deficiency may be an important modifiable risk factor for renal disease progression and complications in these patients. Many small studies documented very low total 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels in nephrotic patients, but the underlying pathophysiology is poorly understood. Further, the safety and efficacy of supplementation in this sizeable patient population must be determined in order to prevent both potential toxicity and under-treatment. The candidate's preliminary work demonstrated that glomerular disease, particularly focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), was an independent risk factor for low total and free 25(OH) D levels and vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) in children with chronic kidney disease. These findings implicate impaired tubular reabsorption of 25(OH) D-DBP complexes and/or increased vitamin D catabolism. The proposed project comprises: (1) an ancillary cross-sectional study of 450 participants in the NIH-funded Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE) and (2) a pilot study of cholecalciferol supplementation in 35 children and young adults with FSGS. Leveraging NEPTUNE's unique repository of standardized histopathology data, this work will be the first to determine the association between tubulointerstitial injury an vitamin D metabolites and to delineate the impact of fibroblast growth factor 23-promoted catabolism on vitamin D levels in these patients. The supplementation study will address the safety and efficacy of calciferol supplementation in proteinuric FSGS patients and use novel translational measures of innate immunity and intra-renal inflammation to assess the response to supplementation. The findings of this work will be critical to the design and conduct of subsequent vitamin D trials, and to the development of supplementation guidelines. The candidate's comprehensive career development plan includes didactic training in clinical trials and immunology, and mentorship by leaders in epidemiology, biostatistics, nephrology and immunology. She will draw on outstanding resources including the CHOP Research Institute and CTSA, the Center for Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, and NEPTUNE. Her short-term goals are to: (1) dedicate 75% effort to this research and training program; (2) subsequently compete for NIH funds to support a trial of vitamin D supplementation and its impact on immune function and infectious complications in patients with glomerular diseases; and (3) expand the NEPTUNE study to relate baseline vitamin D levels and measures of mineral metabolism to cardiovascular disease, infections and renal disease progression. Her long-term goal is to lead an NIH-funded translational research program in children and adults with glomerular disease, with an emphasis on interventions to reduce complications and disease progression in this high-risk population.        ","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to a variety of adverse health outcomes. Nephrotic patients have very low vitamin D levels, and the underlying mechanisms are not known. Furthermore, approaches to safely and effectively supplement vitamin D in these patients have not been established. The insights gained from this study are necessary to inform subsequent trials of vitamin D therapy to improve outcomes and develop unique supplementation guidelines for children and adults with diseases complicated by nephrotic syndrome.",

VITAL-DED proposes to study the efficacy of marine omega-3 fatty acid (FA) supplementation for the prevention of DED, as well as the long-term amelioration of its associated chronic ocular surface pain and quality of life impacts, which include problems reading and driving. The study will leverage invaluable resources and data from the VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL, 1U01CA138962), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2x2 factorial trial to test marine omega-3 FA (465 mg/d eicosapentaenoic acid + 375 mg/d docosahexaenoic acid) and vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol, 2000 IU/d) supplements in the primary prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease among 20,000 men and women aged >50 y & >55 y, respectively. Beginning in July 2011 and continuing throughout 2012, willing and eligible respondents to an invitational mailing will be enrolled in a  month run-in, and subsequently those who remain willing, eligible, and compliant during the run-in will be randomly assigned to omega-3 FA or a matching placebo and vitamin D3 or a matching placebo. At 1-year intervals, participants will receive a new supply of pills and a follow up questionnaire on compliance, side effects, and incidence of health endpoints. We propose to ascertain prevalent (pre-randomization) and incident (post-randomization) DED endpoints in the VITAL trail. The primary Specific Aims of VITAL-DED are to test whether omega-3 FA supplementation: 1) reduces the incidence of DED, 2) improves the natural history of DED by relieving symptoms and other impacts on quality of life. Secondary Aims will estimate the incidence of DED in the US, prospectively examine the natural history of DED, explore factors that could modify or influence the impact of omega-3 FA supplementation, evaluate the inter-relationship of DED and depression, and test for possible independent or joint effects of vitamin D3 supplementation in the incidence and natural history of DED. This research is responsive to a program priority of the National Eye Institute's Strategic Plan to improve our understanding of and develop preventive strategies for inflammatory corneal and ocular surface diseases; and also addresses several issues identified in the recent 2010 NEI Workshop on Ocular Pain and Sensitivity. The hypotheses are supported by a compelling biological rationale and strong preliminary data from our prior epidemiological studies, as well as from laboratory investigations and small randomized trials, which suggest that omega-3 FA supplementation, could prevent DED and improve its natural history. We believe the timely start of VITAL-DED offers a unique but time-sensitive opportunity to obtain a reliable, efficient, and informative evaluation of the efficacy of the most promising preventive agent for DED. Given our success with prior large simple trials, our experience with DED, and our proposed methodology, we think VITAL-DED will provide definitive results to guide public health and clinical recommendations for DED prevention and management.        ","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to accelerate the identification and availability of a safe and effective strategy to prevent dry eye disease (DED) and improve its natural history. This is important because DED is very common among older Americans, causing chronic ocular pain, an increased risk of infection, and problems with activities such as reading and driving. Existing evidence points to omega-3 fatty acids as the most promising agent to test for DED prevention and therapy, and we will take advantage of the incomparable opportunity offered by the VITAL trial (VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL), a large randomized trial of 20,000 older men and women to evaluate whether a supplement of omega-3 fatty acids versus a placebo can prevent DED and improve people's quality of life.",

Pafients suffering from the progressive, bacilli-abundant lepromatous form (L-lep) ofthe disease are more likely to be vitamin D-deficient and benefit clinically from ultraviolet B (sunlight) irradiation or dietary supplementation vitamin D. Such patients are also at risk for developing dysregulated over- production of the active vitamin D metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D) from circulating 25- hydroxyvitamin D (25D) by disease-activated macrophages. On the other hand, intracellular 1,25D synthesis and action at the level of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) is crucial for mounting an antimicrobial response to mLEP. Therefore, the mechanism(s) that govern vitamin D metabolism and action in leprosy is a key component to the disease.

Heavy alcohol use and HIV infection are both causes of microbial translocation, the process by which bacterial products from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract leak across the GI membrane to the portal circulation. Microbial translocation causes immune activation leading to end organ damage. Alcohol can cause microbial translocation via zinc deficiency. Zinc deficiency is common among HIV+ heavy drinkers and linked to high mortality rates. Zinc supplementation is affordable, available, does not interfere with ART, and has minimal adverse drug reactions. In animal models zinc reduces ethanol associated microbial translocation. In human studies zinc slows HIV disease progression and reduces levels of inflammatory biomarkers which are strongly linked to mortality. Given zinc's potential efficacy we propose to conduct Zinc for INflammation and Chronic disease in HIV (ZINC HIV), a double-blinded randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of zinc supplementation vs. placebo among 250 HIV+ Russians, who are ART-naive at enrollment and have a recent history of heavy drinking. We will recruit most of our participants from the Russia cohort within the Uganda Russia Boston Alcohol Network for Alcohol Research Collaboration on HIV/AIDS (URBAN ARCH) Consortium study. Our specific aims will test the efficacy of zinc supplementation, compared to placebo to (1) improve markers of mortality as measured by the VACS index; (2) slow HIV disease progression as measured by CD4 cell count; (3) improve markers of AMI risk as measured by the Reynolds risk score; and (4) lower levels of microbial translocation and inflammation as measured by serum biomarkers. We hypothesize that as compared with placebo, patients receiving zinc supplementation will have significantly lower AMI and mortality risk as measured by the VACS index and Reynolds risk scores; higher CD4 cell counts; lower levels of biomarkers for microbial translocation and inflammation. Importantly, if our hypotheses are true, zinc supplementation could ultimately become a standard adjunctive therapy complementing alcohol interventions among HIV+ persons even in resource limited environments.        ","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The combination of heavy alcohol consumption and HIV infection results in serious health problems and an increased risk of death. Although it is not exactly clear how alcohol and HIV do this, inflammation appears to play an important role. Zinc supplementation has anti-inflammatory properties. This study is designed to see if giving zinc supplementation to HIV infected people who are heavy drinkers reduces the risk of serious health problems and death.",

This proposal will assess interventions aimed at preventing CTIBL in postmenopausal breast cancer patients caused by aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy, which results in a 2- to 4-fold increase in bone loss and significantly increase fracture risk in this population. The research project will tet the efficacy of high-dose vitamin D supplementation plus a personalized weight-bearing exercise program to prevent CTIBL. Career Development Plan: Dr. Peppone's previous experience as an epidemiologist specializing in cancer, combined with his ongoing training as a clinical cancer control researcher, makes him well-suited to become a independent researcher with a focus on the pathogenesis and treatment of CTIBL. His training goals will expand upon his knowledge and are divided into three training aims: 1) to develop expertise in the biology, physiology, genetics, and measurement of CTIBL, 2) to gain experience as a PI in the design, conduct, and analysis of Phase II/III randomized controlled clinical trials, and 3) to gain experience in the testing and implementation of a nutritional supplement intervention (vitamin D) and behavioral interventions (exercise) for CTIBL. Dr. Gary Morrow, a leading cancer control researcher for the past thirty years, will serve as Dr. Peppone's principal senior mentor and offer guidance in the area of clinical trial conduct. Co-mentor Dr. Randy Rosier and Advisor Dr. Alissa Huston will provide expertise in the biology, physiology, and contributing factors of CTIBL. Co-mentor Dr. Mary Reid and Advisor Donald Trump offer experience in the efficacy and pharmacology of vitamin D for the management of CTIBL, while co-mentor Dr. Karen Mustian will train Dr. Peppone in the development and implementation of exercise interventions for CTIBL.

Persons with diabetes are at high risk of developing kidney disease, and DKD is both the leading cause of end stage renal disease in the developed world and a potent amplifier of cardiovascular disease risk. Vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids are promising interventions for DKD prevention and treatment, based on results of animal-experimental models and early human studies. Because these interventions are relatively safe, inexpensive, and widely available, they may offer opportunity to substantially reduce the burden of DKD in large populations. We aim to test whether vitamin D3 and/or omega-3 fatty acids prevent progression of albuminuria and loss of glomerular filtration rate, two complementary manifestations of DKD, over 4 years of treatment. To effectively and efficiently test study hypotheses, we propose an ancillary study to the Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial (VITAL), an NIH-funded randomized clinical trial. In VITAL, 20,000 participants (men ages e 60 years, women ages e 65 years) will be randomly assigned in a 2x2 factorial design to vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 1600 IU daily versus placebo, and to eicosapentaenoic acid 500 mg plus docosahexaenoic acid 500 mg daily versus placebo, and followed for a mean of 5 years to assess effects on cardiovascular disease and cancer events. Leveraging the established infrastructure of VITAL, we propose to identify and recruit a sub-cohort of 1,500 VITAL participants with diabetes at baseline and to ascertain effects of study interventions on albuminuria and glomerular filtration rate in this group. Following the simple and cost-efficient design of the parent VITAL trial, biospecimens will be collected locally and delivered to the VITAL central laboratory by mail. First morning voids will be collected at baseline and year 4 for measurement of urine albumin-creatinine ratio. Blood samples will be collected simultaneously for measurement of glomerular filtration rate (using serum creatinine and cystatin C), 25- hydroxyvitamin D, eicosapentaenoic acid plus docosahexaenoic acid, C-reactive protein, and hemoglobin A1c. The proposed studies are designed to determine whether vitamin D3 and/or omega-3 fatty acids have causal and clinically relevant effects on the development and progression of DKD.      ","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a cause of substantial morbidity and mortality. Despite widespread use of intensive glycemic control and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors, renal and cardiovascular consequences of DKD remain common. This study will evaluate whether vitamin D3 and/or omega-3 fatty acids are safe and effective interventions to reduce the burden of DKD among the large and growing diabetic population.

Besecker, M.D. is an Assistant Professor in the Pulmonary and Critical Care Division at The Ohio State University. Dr. Besecker's initial basic science research evaluated zinc's cytoprotective role in lung epithelia. Recently she has been involved in translational research evaluating the role of zinc in bacterial phagocytosis and clearance in sepsis. Dr. Besecker utilizes both an in vitro and murine in vivo model for her zinc-related phagocytosis studies. She has also conducted two observational studies evaluating zinc's relation to the severity of illness and mortality in critically ill septi patients. Dr. Besecker's short term goal is to obtain training in both immunobiology specific to innate immunity/ bacterial clearance and clinical research design and implementation to allow her to transition to an independent translational researcher in the areas of zinc immunobiology and sepsis. A longer term goal is to develop and lead a translational, multi-center research program that focuses on optimizing nutrition to improve patient outcomes in the critically ill. Support from a K23 Mentored Career Development Award would provide the foundation to attain these goals. Career Development: Dr. Besecker's career development/ training will cover 4 Core Areas and include: 1) Laboratory techniques- flow cytometry and animal surgery; 2) Design and management of interventional clinical trials; 3) Project Management/ Organization of Research Programs; 4) Core Knowledge- immunobiology, pharmacology, and biostatistics. Training will also be enhanced by interaction with mentor team members and participation in local and international meetings. Environment: Dr. Besecker's environment is conducive to excellent research. She has the scientific support of five exceptional R01 funded investigators with mentoring experience including Mentor, Dr. Larry Schlesinger and Co-mentor, Dr. Susan Koletar. Dr. Besecker has financial support from her institute, division, mentors, and currently an NIH-funded OSU Center for Clinical and Translation Sciences KL2 award. Research: Sepsis, a systemic inflammatory response to infection, kills over 215,000 patients and costs 16 billion dollars annually. Zinc has immune regulatory and cell protective properties and may be an important therapy for improved survival in patients with sepsis. Central Hypothesis: Zinc supplementation in septic subjects improves monocyte/macrophage (Mo/M¿) phagocytosis and consequently improves bacterial clearance, inflammatory balance, and mortality. Aim 1: Determine whether maximization of Mo/M¿ phagocytosis by zinc supplementation in Zn and ZD septic mice can improve bacterial burden, inflammatory balance, and mortality and determine the contribution of Fc?R and CR3 expression and function to phagocytosis Aim 2: Determine the safety and toxicity profile of zinc supplementation over a range that may impact plasma zinc status, bacterial phagocytosis, and inflammatory balance in patients with severe sepsis        ","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sepsis is the term used to describe the body's response to a serious infection and this condition is the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, killing over 215,000 patients per year. It is not well understood why people die of sepsis and the treatments for this condition are limited. Zinc has known immune regulatory properties, has been shown to decrease the duration of some infections in children, and may be beneficial in treating sepsis. This proposal is designed to answer how zinc may work in this situation and if zinc supplementation is safe in patients with sepsis.",

Alcohol's adverse effects on brain development and cognitive abilities are among the most devastating consequences. Prenatal exposure to alcohol is one of the leading preventable causes of birth defects, intellectual disability, and neurodevelopmental disorders. However, despite extensive public health warnings and prevention efforts, women continue to consume alcohol during pregnancy, particularly in patterns known to be of high risk to the developing fetus. The prevalence of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) is estimated to be as high as 2-5% of young school children in the U.S., placing considerable social and economic burdens on the individual, families, and community. These significant ramifications call for the development of comprehensive treatment programs to ameliorate the adverse consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure. Choline, an essential nutrient, is critical for fetal brain development and studies have shown that early supplementation leads to long-lasting cognitive enhancement. Animal models of FASD have also revealed that choline supplementation can reduce the severity of alcohol-related cognitive impairments, even when given postnatally after alcohol damage has occurred. Given this preclinical evidence, the goal of the current proposal is to translate these findings toa clinical population and determine if choline can effectively reduce neuropsychological impairments in children with FASD. Currently, two clinical studies are examining the effects of prenatal choline supplementation in women drinking alcohol during pregnancy as well as early postnatal supplementation in young children. However, as many children with FASD are not diagnosed until they enter school, it is essential to examine treatment options that can be effective throughout middle and later childhood. Animal data suggest that choline may still be effective even when administered during this later period of development. Thus, this study will determine whether choline can improve cognitive functioning in school age children. The specific aims of the proposal are to investigate whether choline supplementation can reduce the severity of learning and memory, executive function, and attention deficits in children with FASD.        "," Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) is a serious public health concern not only within the U.S. but also throughout the world. Because women continue to drink alcohol during pregnancy despite known risks, there is a need to seek effective treatments that will mitigate developmental alcohol-related deficits. Animal models have demonstrated that the nutritional supplement choline can ameliorate the severity of cognitive deficits associated with developmental alcohol exposure, yet research is only beginning to examine the effectiveness of choline supplementation in a clinical population; thus, the proposed study intends to translate preclinical research of a potential therapeutic in children with FASD.

Dr. Dougherty proposes a comprehensive, interdisciplinary training program that will provide her with the skills and experience necessary to develop into an independent academic patient-oriented investigator in pediatric research, focusing on clinical trials addressing nutrition- and physical activity-related issues affecting children with sickle cell disease (SCD). Her career development will be guided by an accomplished team of investigators in nutrition, growth, chronic disease, stable isotope assessment, ophthalmology, epidemiology / study design and biostatistics. Her primary mentor, Virginia Stallings, M.D. has conducted pediatric clinical nutrition and chronic disease research for the last 27 years and as Director of the Office of Faculty Development at CHOP, has an superb reputation for supporting the development of junior faculty into independent, NIH-funded, clinical investigators. The proposed mentored experience will take place in one of the most outstanding nutrition and SCD clinical research environments in the country. Dr. Dougherty's training will include advanced formal coursework in research design, biostatistics, research ethics and stable isotopes. This training is crucial to build upon the foundations of nutrition and SCD research knowledge that she obtained during her postdoctoral fellowship and UPenn Masters in Translational Research (MTR) thesis work and to prepare her for future R01 submissions to conduct nutrition intervention studies in children with SCD. The proposed research project will focus on suboptimal vitamin A (vit A) status which is prevalent in children with type SS sickle cell disease (SCD-SS) and associated with hospitalizations and poor growth and hematological status. The preliminary data in children with SCD-SS show that vit A supplementation at the dose recommended for healthy children failed to improve vit A status, resulting in no change in hospitalizations, growth or dark adaptation. This indicates an increased vit A requirement most likely due to chronic inflammation, low vit A intake and possible stool or urine loss. The dose of vit A needed to optimize vit A status in subjects with SCD-SS is unknown. The proposed research study will establish the safety and efficacy of vit A supplementation doses (3000 and 5000 IU/d) compared to placebo over 3 months in 66 children with SCD-SS, age 9-to 18-yrs and test the impact of vit A supplementation on the key functional and clinical outcomes. The key safety measures are concurrently elevated serum retinol (age specific) and liver function tests (3x age specific). Efficacy is evaluated by repletion of liver vt A stores using state of the art stable isotope methods. In SCD-SS, total body vit A pool size and liver vit A concentration are assessed before and after the 3 month intervention using the deuterated-retinol-dilution technique. Baseline vit A status will be assessed in similar healthy subjects as a comparison group. Vit A therapy has great promise to safely and economically improve complications and quality of life for patients with SCD. Well-designed trials are urgently needed to determine the clinical impact of vit A supplementation and this study is the next step.                ","Project Narrative Optimal vitamin A (vit A) concentration and metabolism are essential for normal immune function, growth, development, reproduction, muscle function and vision in children, adolescents and adults with type SS sickle cell disease (SCD-SS). The impact of vit A supplementation will be evaluated for safety and efficacy using clinically important outcomes, and this will overcome the critical barrier for use of vit A supplementation in research and clinical care. Inexpensive and easy to administer, vit A supplementation may prove to be an effective and feasible treatment for symptoms and prevention of side effects for people of all ages living with SCD-SS in the US and around the world.",

Heavy alcohol consumption and HIV infection are both causes of microbial translocation, the process by which bacterial products leak across the gastrointestinal membrane with resultant destructive immune activation. Alcohol can lead to microbial translocation directly through zinc deficiency. Low zinc levels, affecting 30-50% of alcohol dependent persons, are associated w ith reduced immune function and HIV disease progression. Among HIV-infected people, high levels of microbial translocation (as measured by soluble CD14) and inflammation/altered coagulation (as measured by D- dimer) are each associated with an increased risk of death. Of importance, among HIV-infected persons, heavy drinking is also significantly associated with higher levels of D-dimer in cross-sectional studies. Of note, initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is associated with a reduction in D-dimer levels. Yet the following is not known: is there a longitudinal relationship between alcohol consumption and these biomarkers independent of ART; and does zinc supplementation improve biomarker levels? Answering these questions requires a setting with prevalent HIV infection, heavy alcohol use and limited current ART use. As Russia has a relatively young, expanding HIV epidemic, a growing HIV treatment infrastructure and enormous per capita alcohol consumption, St. Petersburg is a setting where this research is possibi e. Thus, as part of the Uganda, Russia, Boston Alcohol Network for Alcohol Research Collaboration on HIV/AIDS (URBAN ARCH) Consortium, we seek to create the Russia ARCH cohort from participants of a recently completed NIAAA-funded randomized controlled trial (RCT) of HIV-infected Russian heavy drinkers and perform the following: [1] an assessment of the longitudinal association between alcohol consumption and biomarkers of microbial translocation (sCD14) and inflammation/altered coagulation (D-dimer); [2] implementation of the Zinc Intervention Nested in a Cohort (ZINC) study, a double-blinded, placebo controlled, RCT to determine if short term zinc supplementation results in lower biomarker levels and whether the effects differ based on alcohol consum ption. These studies will clarify the association between alcohol and key biomarkers overtime and evaluate a pragmatic treatment, zinc supplementation, as a therapy in HIV-infected heavy drinkers.       "," The Russia ARCH Cohort and the ZINC study will draw from an established cohort of HIV-infected heavy drinkers to examine alcohol's impact on biomarkers reflecting microbial translocation and inflammation/ altered coagulation and to evaluate a pragmatic treatment: zinc supplementation. With successful completion of the specific aims, the study can clarify the association between alcohol and these biomarkers overtime and assess if zinc merits consideration in larger studies as a therapy in HIV-infected heavy drinkers.

"5","U01","DK097093","A Novel Approach to Phosphorus Lowering in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease","","30-Apr-2018","Ix, Joachim ","UNITED STATES","519335","2014","DK","    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is highly prevalent and strongly associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Because traditional CVD risk factors do not fully explain the link between CKD and CVD, it is likely that 'non-traditional' risk factors that are altered in CKD may be involved. Among such factors, higher serum phosphorus (Pi) levels represent a causal candidate, and may be modifiable.  Higher serum Pi induces arterial calcification, arterial stiffness, and left ventricular hypertrophy in animals. Similar fidings are observed in humans, and higher Pi levels are also associated with the development and progression of CKD, CVD events and mortality in humans. The KDIGO international clinical practice guidelines recommend targeting Pi within the normal range and recommends using oral phosphorus binders (OPBs) to do so. However, since the recommendations were published, studies have consistently shown that OPBs have minimal efficacy for Pi lowering in CKD stage 3-4, even with very high doses and pill burden, and may be associated with harm. In contrast, animal studies and pilot studies in humans show that nicotinamide (vitamin B3) substantially lowers serum Pi levels, and can do so with only 1-2 pills/day. Nicotinamide reduces Pi through a different mechanism. Rather than binding Pi, it blocks intestinal Pi absorption by down-regulating a key intestinal Pi transporter. The lipid drug niacin contains both nicotinamide and nicotinic acid, and we have shown that it lowers Pi in CKD patients. However, nicotinamide alone may have advantages. Unlike niacin, it does not cause flushing, liver test abnormalities, hyperuricemia, or insulin resistance. Nicotinamide has considerable long-term safety data in the general population, is available over the counter as a dietary supplement in the US, and would cost about $2/patient/month. Thus, nicotinamide may provide a readily available, well-tolerated, inexpensive, and convenient method to lower serum Pi levels in patients with CKD.  However, the efficacy of nicotinamide for Pi lowering in CKD stage 3-4 is unknown. Moreover, the effects of nicotinamide on other components of mineral metabolism including urine phosphorus excretion and counter- regulatory hormones FGF23, PTH, and calcitriol are unknown. Changes in these factors may have their own influences on CVD, CKD progression, and bone health. Thus, nicotinamide is not yet ready for widespread clinical use in CKD patients. The efficacy for Pi lowering and effects on other components of mineral metabolism must first be established.  We propose a phase 2, randomized double blind placebo controlled study among 150 patients with eGFR 20-45ml/min/1.73m2 treated with nicotinamide or placebo for 6 months. Our primary aims are to determine (1) the Pi lowering efficacy, (2) the effects of nicotinamide on other components of mineral metabolism including urine phosphorus excretion and Pi regulatory hormones. If effective and well tolerated, this study will rapidly alter the standard of care by introducing icotinamide for Pi lowering in CKD stage 3-4.         ","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Most patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) die of cardiovascular disease (CVD) before they ever progress to kidney failure, retention of serum phosphorus is a potential explanatory factor, and clinical practice guidelines suggest keeping serum phosphorus concentrations within the normal range in CKD patients. Existing therapies to lower phosphorus in CKD are minimally effective, and may cause harm. We have identified an inexpensive, readily available, convenient vitamin (nicotinamide) that substantially lowers serum phosphorus. This study will establish the phosphorus lowering efficacy of nicotinamide, and its effects on other components of mineral bone disease in CKD patients.",

Diet is an important risk factor for CRC and dietary constituents are modified by gut microbial action. Microbial fermentation of dietary fiber and plant lignans in high-fiber foods produces bioactive endproducts, such as butyrate and enterolignans. The enterolignans, enterolactone (ENL) and enterodiol (END) have been associated with lower CRC in some epidemiologic studies. Lignans and dietary fiber have been shown to reduce colon tumors in animal models and butyrate and END and ENL influence cellular pathways important to cancer risk in vitro.   We propose a 3-period randomized, cross-over intervention in 70 healthy men and women (ages 20-45)  with the goal to test the effect of a flaxseed lignan supplement and defatted flaxseed meal (containing  lignans + dietary fiber) as compared to placebo on: 1) host gene expression in epithelial and stromal cells  from colon biopsies and exfoliated colonocytes extracted from feces; 2) gut microbial community  composition, and 3) the interaction of the gut microbiome, enterolignan exposure, and colonic gene  expression in high- and low-ENL excreters. Colon biopsies, stool, and urine will be collected at the end of each of the three 60-day periods to evaluate effects of the lignan treatments. We will use an innovative application of RNA-seq to measure gene expression in human colon cells from biopsy and stool. The gut microbiome will be characterized using pyrosequencing and QPCR of the 16S rRNA gene. Lignans will be measured in urine by GC-MS. Further, using samples from a subset of intervention participants who are low-and high-ENL excreters, we will measure the functional metagenomics of the gut microbiome in vitro.   This proposed project will be the first to integrate and characterize, through a unique interdisciplinary collaboration, the relationships between lignan exposure, gut microbial ecology, and gene expression in cell- signaling pathways. Results of this placebo-controlled intervention will bridge the current knowledge from pre-clinical animal models and epidemiologic studies and will help to inform approaches for CRC prevention.            ","RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Intake of foods high in dietary fiber is associated with lower risk of colorectal cancer.

Research over the past 50 years has shown that both systemic and localized inflammation play an important role in the onset and progression of destructive diseases such as cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome/diabetes and allergic asthma. The overall goal of this Center is to delineate the molecular mechanisms by which botanical oils prevent or impact these diseases with a particular focus on immunity and inflammation. The central hypothesis of the Center is that medium chain poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in botanical oils and their metabolites impact several key mechanisms (including altering pro-and anti-inflammatory mediator production and blocking inflammatory gene expression) that inhibit inflammatory processes. A secondary hypothesis is that that the metabolism and effectiveness of PUFA-based botanical dietary supplements is strongly associated with genetic polymorphisms in the fatty acid desaturase (FADS 1-3) cluster on chromosome 11 in a region known as 11q12-q13. This chromosomal region has repeatedly been linked to pro-inflammatory conditions.

Research over the past 50 years has shown that both systemic and localized inflammation play an important role in the onset and progression of destructive diseases such as cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome/diabetes and allergic asthma. The overall goal of this Center is to delineate the molecular mechanisms by which botanical oils prevent or impact these diseases with a particular focus on immunity and inflammation. The central hypothesis of the Center is that medium chain poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in botanical oils and their metabolites impact several key mechanisms (including altering pro-and anti-inflammatory mediator production and blocking inflammatory gene expression) that inhibit inflammatory processes. A secondary hypothesis is that that the metabolism and effectiveness of PUFA-based botanical dietary supplements is strongly associated with genetic polymorphisms in the fatty acid desaturase (FADS 1-3) cluster on chromosome 11 in a region known as 11q12-q13. This chromosomal region has repeatedly been linked to pro-inflammatory conditions.

"5","R01","AR063910","DBP and the bioavailability and function of vitamin D","","31-May-2018","ADAMS, JOHN S.; HEWISON, Martin ","UNITED STATES","401332","2014","AR","    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the last ten years there has been a remarkable renaissance in vitamin D research. Two key concepts have underpinned this renewed interest in the health benefits of vitamin D. First is the continuing debate on the worldwide prevalence of vitamin D-insufficiency, and how optimal vitamin D status can be safely achieved through conventional exposure to sunlight and dietary intake. Second is the potential for vitamin D to promote health benefits beyond its classical effects on the skeleton. Following a recent data review, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) has issued statements aimed at addressing some of the key questions concerning our new perspective on vitamin D and human health. The Recommended Dietary Allowance of vitamin D for all age groups was elevated based on bone responses to vitamin D. However, the IOM report also recognized the need for further research to better define 'non-classical' health benefits of vitamin D. The long-term impact of these recommendations is crucially dependent on one question - how does one define vitamin D-sufficiency and -insufficiency? The proposed project describes a new paradigm for quantifying optimal vitamin D and its relation to human health. The overall aim is to demonstrate that vitamin D activity is not simply defined by total serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25D) but instead depends on the bioavailability of this metabolite to target cells and its subsequent conversion to active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D) via the enzyme 1¿-hydroxylase (CYP27B1). The proposal hypothesizes that the ability of 25D to access target cells is influenced by its association with the serum vitamin D binding protein (DBP), with 'free' rather than 'DBP-bound' 25D being the bioactive form of this metabolite. The overall objective of the proposal will be to investigate the impact of DBP on the bioactivity of 25D using both mouse and human models. Studies using transgenic, knockout, and humanized mice will investigate how variations in the concentration and vitamin D metabolite binding affinity of DBP affect the response of these mice to 25D and 1,25D under conditions of vitamin D-sufficiency and -deficiency. Data from these experiments will then be related to studies in humans, where DBP concentration and binding affinity are strongly influenced by genetic variations in the DBP gene. Human studies will incorporate analysis of DBP and free 25D/1,25D in a large patient cohort with multiple measures of vitamin D function, but will also involve a pilot supplementation study utilizing parental vitamin D or 25D. These analyses will employ a new mathematical algorithm for determining serum free 25D and 1,25D and will use novel assay technology to physically measure serum levels of free 25D. This model not only puts forward a new paradigm for defining optimal vitamin D status but also aims to highlight a more 'personalized' perspective on vitamin D health that will incorporate both classical and non-classical actions of vitamin D.   .        "," 1. RESEARCH AIMS In recent years there has been considerable discussion about the role of vitamin D in human health. Central to this debate is the definition of 'optimal' vitamin D status - at present determined by the total serum concentration of pro-hormone 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25D). However, this parameter remains controversial with target levels for circulating 25D varying considerably depending on the population and clinical endpoint being studied. The aim of the current proposal is to provide an entirely new paradigm for defining vitamin D status based on the bioactivity of 25D and other vitamin D metabolites. Hypothesis: We propose that the biological activity of vitamin D cannot be defined simply by total circulating levels of pro-hormone 25D and its subsequent conversion to active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D). We contend that the target cell function of vitamin D metabolites will depend on their dynamic association with the vitamin D binding protein (DBP), the key chaperone for serum vitamin D metabolites. We specifically hypothesize that the role of vitamin D in skeletal and extra-skeletal health is more clearly defined by the level of 'free' 25D that is available to target cells. The overall objective of the proposed project is to test this hypothesis, functionally and mechanistically, using a combination of novel transgenic animal models, established human cohort samples, and a pilot vitamin D supplementation trial. Aim 1. Demonstrate that serum levels of DBP modulate free serum 25D and alter vitamin D bioactivity. 1.A. Use knockout and transgenic models to demonstrate the role of serum mouse Dbp concentrations in determining free serum 25D, its accumulation in peripheral tissues and local conversion to 1,25D. 1.B. Determine the effects of Dbp concentration and free/bioavailable serum 25D on vitamin D activity in mice using classical (skeletal) and non-classical (immunological) models of vitamin D-dependent disease. Aim 2. Use humanized mouse models to show that serum free/bioavailable 25D is not exclusively determined by DBP concentration but is also dependent on binding affinity for 25D. 2.A. Rescue of DBP expression in Dbp knockout mice using allele-specific DNA for human DBP will be used to mimic human variations in DBP binding affinity for vitamin D metabolites. 2.B. Humanized transgenic mice will be used to demonstrate the effects of DBP binding affinity on levels of free 25D in serum and peripheral tissues, and the impact of this on classical (skeletal) and non-classical (immunological) models of vitamin D-dependent disease. Aim 3. Show that free/bioavailable 25D is an improved marker for vitamin D function in humans. 3.A. Using MrOS - a large, very well phenotyped population - we will test the hypothesis that a more complete assessment of vitamin D status, including free/bioavailable 25D and 1,25D, will enhance our ability to understand vitamin D effects on classical (skeletal) and non-classical (immunological) outcomes. 3.B. Assess the effects of DBP on vitamin D2, vitamin D3, or 25D3 repletion in deficient subjects, using both classical and non-classical responses to supplementation. Our 21st century view of vitamin D is that many of its important actions on human health are independent of established vitamin D endocrinology, and instead are mediated via local intracrine conversion of 25D to 1,25D. This mode of action requires site-specific activation of 25D - a key focal point of our studies at UCLA. However, the intracrine function of vitamin D is also crucially dependent on another mechanism that has received scant attention over the last 10 years - the delivery of bioavailable 25D to target cells. In addressing this, the proposed project brings together a unique team of researchers with a common interest in vitamin D. The joint PIs, Dr. Hewison and Dr. Adams, have between them over 60 years of clinical and basic science experience that includes seminal studies of both classical and non-classical actions of vitamin D. The project is further enhanced by key collaborations with world renowned researchers: Dr. Philip Liu (UCLA); Dr. Eric Orwoll (Oregon Health and Science University); Dr. Nancy Cooke (The University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine). With this environment in mind, the studies outlined above have the potential to revolutionize our perspective on vitamin D and specifically the concept of vitamin D 'sufficiency' and 'insufficiency'. Successful completion of the project will be underpinned by innovative models and technology, including studies of animal models and human subjects. The overall aim of the proposal will be to re-define our perspective on optimal vitamin D status for human health. !!",

The study will leverage invaluable resources and data from the VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2x2 factorial trial designed to test vitamin D (vitamin D3 [cholecalciferol], 2000 IU/d) and marine omega-3 fatty acid (eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] + docosahexaenoic acid [DHA], 1 g/d) supplements in the primary prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease. The National Institutes of Health (1U01CA138962) is funding the main VITAL trial, which will study 20,000 men aged e60 y and women aged $ e65 y. Beginning in October 2010 and continuing throughout 2011, willing and eligible respondents to an $ invitational mailing will be enrolled in a 3-month run-in, and subsequently those who remain willing and eligible, and who report having taken at least two-thirds of study pills, will be randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups for 5 years: vitamin D3 (2000 IU/d) and fish oil (EPA+DHA, 1 g/d); vitamin D3 and fish oil placebo; vitamin D3 placebo and fish oil; and vitamin D3 placebo and fish oil placebo. At 1-year intervals, participants will receive a new supply of pills and a follow-up questionnaire on compliance, possible side effects, and incidence of endpoints. We propose to ascertain prevalent and incident AMD endpoints in the VITAL cohort in order to study the efficacy of vitamin D3 and fish oil in AMD prevention. The Primary Aims of this ancillary study are to test whether: 1) fish oil supplementation (EPA+DHA, 1g/d) reduces the incidence and progression of AMD and whether 2) vitamin D3 supplementation (2000 IU/d) reduces the incidence and progression of AMD. Secondary Aims will test for synergistic or antagonistic effects of vitamin D3 and fish oil, as well as interactions of vitamin D3 and fish oil with common AMD-associated genetic polymorphisms, and polymorphisms related to pathways involved in vitamin D3 or omega-3 fatty acid metabolic activity. This research is responsive to a program priority of the National Eye Institute's Strategic Plan to develop new treatments for AMD. We believe the timely start of the proposed AMD ancillary to the VITAL trial offers a unique but time-sensitive opportunity to obtain a reliable, efficient, and informative evaluation o the efficacy of two extremely promising preventive agents for AMD at a fraction of the cost of separate trials. Given our success with prior mail-based, large, simple trials and cohort studies, our experience with AMD, and our proposed methodology, we believe the trial will be able to provide either definitive positive or informative null results regarding the study hypotheses.        ","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purported health benefits of vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids are receiving increasing attention in the medical literature and the popular press. However, definitive data on health benefits and risks of these agents are lacking. Findings from this large clinical trial will clarify the role of vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid supplements in he prevention of AMD, the leading cause of blindness in US men and women.

The most likely mechanism underlying this arsenic-induced risk is oxidative stress mediated DNA and cellular damage. To identify an effective preventive approach for this increased risk we established the Bangladesh vitamin E and selenium Trial (BEST)-a 2W2 factorial randomized chemoprevention trial (RCT) for evaluating whether long- term vitamin E or selenium supplementation prevents non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) risk and alters oxidative stress markers in peripheral tissues in a uniquely exposed population. In 2005, we were awarded funding for the first 5 years of this 10-year study. The goal of the first funding period was to design BEST and identify, recruit, and randomize 4,444 individuals with arsenic-related skin lesions into 4 treatment arms: vitamin E only (100 IU/day), L-selenomethionine only (200 5g/day), both vitamin E and selenium, and placebo. To ensure the successful completion of the study, we have exceeded our recruitment target by 80% and randomized 7,000 individuals. In the proposed 5 years of the study (7/1/2010-6/30/2015), we will complete the study through continued intervention for 6 years, follow-up (including a post-intervention period), collection of questionnaire and clinical data, and biological samples at various time points, and finally statistical analyses and report writing of the final dataset. In view of current concerns regarding a possible diabetogenic effect of selenium supplementation, we now include a new specific aim to specifically assess treatment effects on that endpoint, in addition to our originally proposed endpoints of NMSC and mortality. Finally, as an extension of our ongoing evaluation of the current specific aim to examine treatment effects on oxidative stress markers, especially 8-OHdG, in peripheral tissues (blood and urine), we now also include an aim to more comprehensively and specifically evaluate treatment effects on a panel of oxidative stress markers measured in normal skin and NMSC tissues-the target tissues of our primary clinical endpoint. Overall, BEST will be a highly efficient and unique RCT, able to evaluate effects of vitamin E and selenium supplementation on prevention of skin cancer and other health outcomes and will create a valuable research resource for future prevention, clinical and molecular research.      ","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In order to identify effective preventive approach for arsenic-related increased cancer risk we propose to continue our 2W2 factorial randomized chemoprevention trial that we established during the last funding period for evaluating whether long-term vitamin E or selenium supplementation prevents non-melanoma skin cancer risk and alters oxidative stress markers in peripheral tissues in a uniquely exposed population. In addition to the original aims on skin cancer and mortality this current proposal also includes a new aim about the treatment effects on diabetes mellitus.              ",

The mortality in this group of patients is unacceptably high. A majority of the deaths are due to cardiovascular diseases, followed by infectious complications and protein-energy wasting. Strategies to reduce the mortality of MHD patients, including those directed at traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as statins, have largely been ineffective. Inflammation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and protein-energy wasting. Biomarkers of the inflammatory state such as       C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are elevated in MHD patients and are also robust predictors of cardiovascular events and mortality in this patient population. While anti-inflammatory interventions, especially specific anti-cytokin therapies have been used successfully to treat patients with inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, and while encouraging studies have been reported in improving glycemic control and beta cell function in type 2 diabetes, there are only limited studies using these interventions in MHD patients. Our investigative group has performed a series of studies investigating the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of a number of anti-inflammatory therapies in MHD patients, including Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), Fish Oil (EPA+DHA), Vitamin E (gamma-tocopherol), alpha lipoic acid (ALA) and CoEnyzme Q10 in studies ranging from 14 patients to 300 patients. We have shown that amongst these interventions, IL-1ra and Fish Oil therapies have the most significant beneficial effects on inflammatory markers, such as hsCRP and    IL- 6; whereas Vitamin E and ALA therapies do not influence inflammatory state in these patients.

"," 1. SPECIFIC AIMS The mortality of patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) in the United States (US) is unacceptably high1. A majority of the deaths are due to cardiovascular diseases, followed by infectious complications and protein-energy wasting (PEW)2. Strategies to reduce the mortality of MHD patients, including those directed at traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as statins, have largely been ineffective3- 5. Biomarkers of the inflammatory state, such as high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin-1 (IL- 1), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), are elevated in MHD patients and are also robust predictors of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality in this patient population6-8. In addition to its predictive ability, inflammation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic CVD and PEW. There is ample evidence showing that atherosclerosis is an inflammatory process and pro-inflammatory cytokines play a crucial role in its development9. There is also a wealth of data supporting an intimate link between systemic inflammation and 'vascular calcification', the other component of cardiovascular disease in end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients10. Pro-inflammatory cytokines are also known to cause anorexia and skeletal muscle breakdown, leading to PEW, a condition with significant morbidity and mortality risk in ESRD patients11. IL-6 and TNF-alpha have been associated with patient reported outcomes including quality of life and symptom burden in chronic kidney disease (CKD)12. Overall, all the available data indicate a cause and effect relationship between inflammation and death risk in ESRD patients rendering treatment of the inflammatory condition as a critically important target to improve outcomes in this high risk patient population. While anti-inflammatory interventions, especially specific anti-cytokine therapies, have been used successfully to treat patients with inflammatory bowel disease13, psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis14, and while encouraging studies have been reported in improving glycemic control and beta cell function in type 2 diabetes 15, there are limited studies using these interventions in MHD patients. We have performed a series of studies investigating the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of a number of anti-inflammatory therapies in MHD patients, including Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) 16, Fish Oil (EPA+DHA) 17, Vitamin E (gamma-tocopherol), Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA) and CoEnyzme Q10 in studies ranging from 14 to over 300 patients. We have shown that amongst these interventions, IL-1ra and Fish Oil have the most significant beneficial effects on inflammatory markers including hsCRP and IL-6; whereas Vitamin E and ALA therapies do not influence the inflammatory state in MHD patients. This grant application is submitted in response to the recent NIDDK RFA DK-12-010 (Novel Interventions to Reduce Morbidity and Mortality of Hemodialysis Patients - Safety and Other Early Phase Studies) and has the overarching aim to study the safety, feasibility and efficacy of promising pharmacological interventions in maintenance hemodialysis patients through a U01 collaboration mechanism. We hypothesize that 6-month therapy of IL-1ra or Fish Oil is feasible and safe in MHD patients with systemic inflammation. We further hypothesize that these therapies will effectively and persistently improve inflammatory markers when compared to placebo. We will test these hypotheses through the following specific aims. Specific Aim 1: To test the efficacy of IL-1ra and Fish Oil on inflammatory biomarkers over 6 months through two separate randomized clinical trials in maintenance hemodialysis patients; Specific Aim 2: To test the safety and tolerability of IL-1ra and Fish Oil over 6 months through two separate randomized clinical trials in maintenance hemodialysis patients; Specific Aim 3: Create a collaborative network of investigators and dialysis facilities for efficient and swift subject recruitment for pilot and feasibility studies in maintenance hemodialysis patients. The ultimate goal of this application is to obtain critical elements of the study design and suitable intervention for a subsequent full-scale randomized controlled clinical trial in MHD patients testing rigorous clinical outcomes including morbidity and mortality. We propose testing two novel anti-inflammatory interventions, each with supportive preliminary data. Our investigative group has a specific interest and unmatched expertise in the proposed area of research. We also have an extensive track record of collaboration, both within our research group and as participating sites for more than 5 collaborative research agreements in CKD and ESRD patients. We have gathered a large consortium of over 30 dialysis units and 3100 subjects for efficient and rapid subject recruitment for Consortium studies. If awarded, our participating site will abide with U01 Consortium requirements and will attend all required meetings including the Steering Committee meeting scheduled for September 9-10, 2013.",

Animal models and observational studies have suggested that marine-derived n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids [PUFA] such as eicosapentanoic acid [EPA] and docosahexanoic acid [DHA] may reduce the risk of colorectal cancer. In addition, it may be the relative proportion of n-3 to n-6 PUFAs that best determines the chemopreventive effects of fish oils. This ratio is important because the n-6 PUFA, arachidonic acid (ARA), is converted via the cyclo-oxygenase pathway to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), an inflammatory eicosanoid aberrantly produced in colorectal neoplasms while EPA is converted to the anti-inflammatory prostaglandin E3 (PGE3). While the ratio of n-6 to n-3 PUFAs can be manipulated through dietary measures, genetic factors may also influence this ratio. Recent genome-wide association and haplotype studies have demonstrated that up to 28% of the additive variance in tissue levels of ARA is explained by variants in a single gene, fatty acid desaturase 1 (FADS1). FADS1 is the rate-limiting enzyme in the conversion of linoleic acid, the most commonly consumed PUFA, to ARA, and homozygotes for the T allele (population frequency of 13%, HapMap -CEU) in rs174537 have lower fatty acid desaturase activity and subsequently lower tissue levels of ARA. Our hypothesis is that individuals with genetically determined lower activity of FADS1 will derive greater benefit from fish oil supplementation than individuals with higher FADS1 activity because of lower tissue levels of ARA and subsequently a more favorable n-6 to n-3 PUFA ratio. To test this hypothesis we will recruit 150 participants with recently identified adenomatous polyps and conduct a 6-month double blind 3 X 2 factorial randomized controlled trial. Our first factor will be FADS1 genotype (GG, GT, and TT) and our second factor will be fish oil supplementation (fish oil versus placebo). Our primary outcome will be the change in rectal epithelial cell proliferation as measured by Ki-67 labeling and rectal crypt apoptosis as measured by TUNEL. Secondary endpoints will include rectal epithelial cell expression of COX-2 and 15-PGDH, rectal cell production of PGE2 and PGE3, rectal mucosal tissue levels of fatty acids, and changes in biomarkers of inflammation (C-reactive protein), adipokines (leptin, adiponectin), and markers of insulin sensitivity. Our specific aims include: 1) to determine the efficacy of fish oil supplements on rectal epithelial cell proliferation indexes and markers of rectal crypt apoptosis, and 2) to determine the effect of genetically-determined fatty acid desaturase 1 activity on fish oil supplementation for colorectal cancer chemoprevention. Our long-term objectives are to determine genetic factors that might influence the efficacy of fish oil supplementation in order to conduct a more definitive adenoma recurrence trial using marine-derived n-3 PUFAs. We anticipate that fish oil will have anti-neoplastic effect and individuals with low FADS1 activity will have a greater response compared to individuals with high FADS1 activity.      ","  Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality within the United States. Fish oils may be beneficial for cancer chemoprevention through their anti-inflammatory properties, however; variations in genes related to polyunsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis may attenuate these effects. This study will investigate the nutrigenomics of fish oil supplementation in colorectal cancer chemoprevention and may have implications beyond cancer prevention as fish oil is being actively investigated for cardiovascular, psychiatric and metabolic diseases.

Data from laboratory studies, epidemiologic research, small primary prevention trials, and/or large secondary prevention trials strongly suggest that these nutritional agents reduce cancer or CVD risk, but large primary prevention trials with adequate dosing in general populations (i.e., unselected for disease risk) are lacking. Growing enthusiasm for supplemental vitamin D and fish oil underscores the urgent need for a timely initiation of such a trial, before their use becomes so prevalent (through supplements and fortification of the food supply) as to render participant recruitment and hypothesis testing impossible. The proposed trial will be conducted among 20,000 men aged e60 and women aged e65, to be recruited from a mailing to 1.2 million persons, including health and other professionals, members of AARP (formerly known as the American Association of Retired Persons), and others. The mailing will contain a letter describing the trial, an informed consent form, and a questionnaire soliciting information on past medical history, cancer and vascular risk factors, diet, and medication and nutritional supplement use. Willing and eligible respondents will be enrolled in a 3-month run-in, during which they will receive placebos. At the end of the run-in, those who remain willing and eligible, and who report having taken at least two-thirds of the pills, will be randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups for 5 years: vitamin D3 (1600 IU/d) and fish oil (EPA+DHA, 1 g/d); vitamin D3 and fish oil placebo; placebo vitamin D3 and fish oil; and placebo vitamin D3 and placebo fish oil. Blood samples will be collected and stored to allow assessment of effect modification by baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid levels, as well as future ancillary studies of genetic/biochemical hypotheses. At 1-year intervals, participants will receive a new supply of pills and a follow-up questionnaire on compliance, possible side effects, and incidence of endpoints. Endpoints will be confirmed by medical record review. Given our success with prior mail-based large simple trials and cohort studies, as well as results of a pilot study in the intended source population, we believe the trial will be able to provide either definitive positive or informative null results regarding the study hypotheses. "," PROJECT NARRATIVE The purported health benefits of vitamin D and marine omega-3 fatty acids are receiving increasing attention in the medical literature and the popular press. However, definitive data on health benefits and risks of these agents are lacking.

Existing therapies for CKD improve outcomes only modestly. Therapeutic strategies that target novel CKD-specific mechanisms of CVD and CKD progression are desperately needed to improve health. Disordered mineral metabolism is a nearly universal complication of CKD, regardless of its underlying etiology. An elevated level of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is the earliest manifestation of disordered mineral metabolism in CKD. FGF23 rises in response to high phosphate diets and in states of impaired phosphate excretion, such as CKD. Rising FGF23 in CKD maintains normal serum phosphate, but also inhibits renal calcitriol production, which causes secondary hyperparathyroidism, and reduces klotho expression, which accelerates arterial calcification. Elevated FGF23 powerfully predicts ESRD, CVD events and death, and data from our group, validated by new preliminary data, suggest potential underlying pathogenic mechanisms: FGF23 induces left ventricular hypertrophy and accelerates CKD progression, and phosphate excess and klotho deficiency induce arterial calcification independent of FGF23.   Based on these data, FGF23 excess and disordered mineral metabolism are leading candidates to target in an outcomes trial. Our long-term goal is to prove by randomized trial that treatment of FGF23 excess and disordered mineral metabolism with phosphate binders, dietary phosphate manipulation, and active vitamin D, will reduce risks of ESRD, CVD events and death in CKD stages 3-4. In this Clinical Center application, we propose two pilot studies to fill remaining knowledge gaps that will inform the design of an outcomes trial. In Pilot Study 1, we will conduct a 6-month, randomized, 3 x 2 study of 150 CKD stage 3-4 patients of lanthanum versus sevelamer versus. placebo, alone and combined with dietary phosphate manipulation to compare their effects on FGF23, phosphate and other mineral metabolites. The results will define which binder should be advanced to an outcomes trial, and whether it should be accompanied by a dietary intervention. In Pilot Study 2, we will conduct a 12-month, randomized, 2 x 2 study of the 'winning' phosphate binder + diet arm in Pilot Study 1 versus placebo, and calcitriol vs. placebo in 220 CKD stage 3-4 patients to test the hypothesis that combining active  therapies will synergistically improve surrogate markers of CVD and renal risk. A decade of work in the field and extensive preliminary data support our hypotheses. Our team has the requisite clinical research expertise in FGF23 and vitamin D to complete these studies. The University of Miami has a track record of recruiting minority participants in multi-center trials, which is critical in diseases that disproportionately affect minorities, such as CKD.  Backed by a strong institutional environment energized by a new CTSA award, our participation in the U01 Consortium will enrich the diversity of study populations it recruits and allow us to contribute to the collaborative effort aimed at improving dismal clinical outcomes suffered by millions of patients with CKD.                 ","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  A high circulating level of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is the earliest manifestation of disordered bone  and mineral metabolism in chronic kidney disease, and it is a powerful risk factor for kidney failure,  cardiovascular disease and death.

Endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide or LPS) is a component of coarse and fine mode PM, bioaerosols, tobacco and biomass smoke. Ozone (O3) is the most commonly encountered ambient air pollutant in the US. Epidemiological studies have shown that both LPS and O3 are important asthma triggers. In challenge studies of AAs, we have shown that LPS and O3 induces influx of neutrophils (PMNs) and eosinophils in AAs as well as augmenting response to inhaled allergens. O3 is also an oxidant, and both O3 and LPS increase radical production by airway cells, with both nutritional and genetically defined antioxidant deficiencies (such as the GSTM1 null genotype) being associated with increased risk for pollutant-induced asthma exacerbation. In challenge studies, we have reported that LPS and O3 PMN responses are increased in GSTM1 null volunteers. Gamma tocopherol has known antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions. We have shown that ?T prevents allergen, O3 and LPS-induced respiratory tract inflammation in rodents. Our phase I human studies with ?T-mT established a dose which maintains ?T and its anti-inflammatory metabolites, decreases monocyte responses to LPS and IgE-mediated basophil response to allergen. Data from our initial double-blinded, placebo controlled phase IIa study in healthy volunteers demonstrates that ?T-mT inhibits LPS-induced granulocyte influx.

In the U.S., the most common type of UI in older adults is urgency UI and mixed-type UI. The most common type of medication used for urgency and mixed UI is an antimuscarinic drug. However, most patients on UI medications do not become completely dry and medications are often discontinued due to costs, negative side effects, or perceived inefficacy. Clearly, more efficacious treatments for UI are urgently needed. Evidence emerging from epidemiologic and clinical cohort studies indicates that lower vitamin D levels are associated with increased risk for UI suggesting that vitamin D may have a role in maintaining continence in women. Because the potential benefits of vitamin D may extend to several organ systems, it is quite possible that vitamin D may maintain continence by supporting skeletal muscle strength and normal detrusor activity. In the proposed study, we hypothesize that adequate vitamin D supplementation (raising serum levels to 30 ng/mL or above) will improve UI symptoms in older women with vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D serum levels less than 20 ng/mL). The primary aim of the proposed double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot trial is to estimate the effect size of weekly vitamin D supplementation in older women with UI and vitamin D deficiency. The second aim is to evaluate if improving serum 25(OH)D levels affect other urinary and bowel symptoms. The third aim is to identify potential mechanisms that may contribute to improved UI symptoms in a subgroup of women, including increased pelvic floor skeletal muscle strength, decreased detrusor muscle over activity, improved mobility, and inflammatory urinary biomarkers. Post-menopausal women with vitamin D deficiency (n=100) will be recruited and randomized to receive weekly oral placebo or 50,000 IU vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) for 12 weeks. Our treatment regimen is intended to achieve serum 25(OH)D levels of 30 ng/mL or above. Changes in UI-episodes will be assessed by 7-day bladder diary and other validated measures of urinary and bowel symptoms administered at baseline and after 12-weeks of intervention. Serum calcium and 25(OH)D levels will be monitored at: baseline, 6-week visit, and the end of 12 weeks of the intervention. Urodynamic (done in 50% of the study group), an assessment of pelvic floor strength, urinary collection for further testing, and mobility will be performed at baseline and 12-weeks.The expected outcomes will provide new knowledge regarding the impact of vitamin D supplementation on UI symptom improvement and inform a larger, randomized controlled clinical trial involving vitamin D supplementation.        ","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Urinary incontinence (UI) is a common disorder among older women that greatly affects quality of life. Emerging evidence from observational studies links vitamin D insufficiency with UI. Prior to a larger intervention trial of vitamin D among older women with low serum vitamin D levels and urgency UI, we propose a pilot study in 100 older women comparing weekly, oral vitamin D3 50,000 IU to placebo.

Osteoporosis and fractures are major health problems in the U.S. with annual expenditures of $19 billion, and the problem is growing. Our goal is to provide nurses and the wider healthcare community best practice guidelines by contributing evidence as to whether a lifestyle intervention should be implemented for women with low bone mass prior to use of bisphosphonate (BP) medications. In this study, women with low bone mass in the first 5 years of menopause (a time of rapid and significant bone loss) will be randomized to 3 groups (n =103 per group): 1) optimal calcium + vitamin D (optimal CaD) alone (Control); 2) a BP plus optimal CaD (Risedronate); or 3) a three times weekly bone loading exercise program plus optimal CaD (Exercise). Adequate calcium and vitamin D are necessary for bone; however, they frequently are not enough to prevent progression of bone loss in post-menopausal women. Although BPs are indicated for women with osteoporosis, their use is controversial for women with early bone loss. One concern is that long-term use of BPs may increase risk for atypical hip and femur fractures. A bone loading exercise program promotes bone health by improving bone structure and bone formation at sites of mechanical stress as well as by preserving BMD. Comparing effectiveness of exercises with BPs is critical because this will determine whether standard practice should include a trial of exercises prior to BP prescriptions in this at risk population.

Our long-term goal is to identify vulnerable pediatri populations at risk for bone loss in order to improve their bone health through an early intervention. This study focuses on the prevention of bone loss that occurs in children and adolescents treated with hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for hematologic malignancies. An increase in bone resorption that occurs after HCT in these patients offers an opportunity for intervention with an anti-resorptive agent, yet no prospective studies have been performed that examine the effectiveness of any bisphosphonate or other anti-resorptive agent in pediatric HCT recipients. Therefore, we propose to conduct a prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial of calcium and vitamin D plus pamidronate versus calcium and vitamin D alone to prevent bone loss after pediatric HCT. The central hypothesis is that subjects treated with pamidronate and calcium and vitamin D (Pamidronate Group) will have higher bone mineral content (BMC) and BMD measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and by peripheral quantitative CT, respectively, at 1 year post-HCT than subjects receiving calcium and vitamin D alone (Control Group). The rationale for this study is that treatment with pamidronate at the time of peak bone resorption can prevent/reverse bone loss and have a positive long-term impact on bone health in pediatric HCT recipients. We will pursue three specific aims: 1) To determine the impact of calcium and vitamin D plus pamidronate versus calcium and vitamin D alone on BMC and BMD following HCT in 60 recipients aged 1-18 years at HCT; 2) To characterize the time course of changes in cytokine levels (IL-6, IL-7, TNF-a) associated with the activation of osteoclasts after HCT and their association with BMC and BMD; 3) To examine the sequence of changes in markers of bone turnover after HCT and their response to pamidronate treatment. The current study is innovative in that it is the first to prospectively evaluate the effects of an anti- resortive agent administered shortly after HCT on BMC and BMD in children. This study is expected to have an important positive impact on bone health in children and the field of pediatric endocrinology by providing much needed prospective data on the effectiveness of an anti-resorptive agent after pediatric HCT.

Proposed mechanisms have included protection of the colonic epithelium against bile acids, direct effects on the cell cycle, modulation of growth factors signaling, inflammation, and immune function. Based on basic science and limited human evidence, we propose to test a novel hypothesis that calcium and vitamin D supplementation strengthens the gut mucosal barrier as indicated by modulation of cell cycle, cell adhesion, receptors responsive to bacterial components, and markers of intestinal inflammation in humans. We also hypothesize that these changes in the colon will be accompanied by decreases in circulating levels of biomarkers of colonic hyperpermeability and pro-inflammatory cytokines. We will investigate this in an adjunct study to an ongoing multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2 x 2 factorial chemoprevention clinical trial (n = 2,259) of supplemental calcium (1,200 mg elemental calcium daily as calcium carbonate) and vitamin D3 (1,000 IU daily), alone and in combination vs. placebo over 3 - 5 years (the 'parent study'). A sub-set of participants (n = 112) with 'non-prep' biopsies of normal-appearing rectal mucosa taken at baseline and 1-year follow-up sigmoidoscopies is selected for this adjunct study. The primary aims of the proposed study are to 1) obtain preliminary data on the separate and joint effects of calcium and vitamin D3 supplementation on biomarkers of gut barrier function (Ki-67/MIB-1, caspase-3, TLR4, TLR5, ZO-1, claudin-1, occludin, mucin-17, E-cadherin, and beta-catenin) and inflammation (NFkappaB and TNFalpha) in biopsies of normal-appearing rectal mucosa, and 2) investigate whether the findings for the tissue-specific biomarkers are correlated with circulating biomarkers of gut barrier function (specific IgG and IgA to lipopolysaccharide [LPS] and flagellin, LPS binding protein [LBP], and intestinal fatty acid  binding protein [I-FABP]) and inflammation (GM-CSF, IFNgamma, IL-6, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-8, IL- 10, IL-12p70, and TNFalpha). The proposed scope of work is limited to laboratory and statistical analyses using biological samples and questionnaire data from the 'parent study'. This adjunct study offers a unique, cost-effective opportunity in a large, ongoing trial in humans to explore a novel hypothesis that calcium and vitamin D beneficially modulate gut barrier function, and to elucidate the combined effects of calcium and vitamin D on biomarkers of gut barrier function and inflammation.

To fill this knowledge gap, we have been conducting VITAL, a highly innovative, cost-efficient, large-scale, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical tria among 26,000 U.S. men and women without cancer or CVD at baseline, who have been selected only on age (men aged e50 and women aged e55), with an oversampling of blacks (ne5000). In a 2x2 factorial design, participants have been randomized to vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol, 2000 IU/d) and marine omega-3 fatty acids (Omacor(R) fish oil, 1 g/d, containing eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] + docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) supplements (or placebos) independently. Contingent on continued funding, the median treatment period will be 5 years. During the first cycle, we have successfully met or surpassed our recruitment goals, enrolled a racially/ethnically diverse cohort, collected baseline blood/DNA samples on >16,000 participants (with plans for follow-up bloods in 6000), and conducted extensive validation studies of the laboratory assays for vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid measurements in the trial. Annual follow-up questionnaires assess treatment compliance (confirmed by blood samples in a subset of participants), side effects, endpoint occurrence, and cancer and vascular risk factors. Self-reported endpoints are confirmed by medical record review by physicians blinded to treatment assignment, and deaths are ascertained through the National Death Index-Plus and other sources. Our archived blood samples allow assessment of effect modification by baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid levels, changes in biomarkers over time, and testing of genetic/biochemical hypotheses. With our scientific colleagues, we have obtained funding for 18 ancillary studies to evaluate the role of these supplements in preventing other chronic diseases (including diabetes, cognitive decline, depression, and autoimmune disorders), and established an in-clinic component for in-depth phenotyping of a subcohort (n=1000). The trial is expected to provide either definitive positive or informative null results for our primary  hypotheses and will serve as a national resource for research on the health effects of vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids, with opportunities for extensive collaborations. This is a high-impact trial due to the potential for major clinical and public health implications of the findings.          ","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purported health benefits of vitamin D and marine omega-3 fatty acids continue to receive much attention in the medical literature and the popular press. However, definitive data on health benefits and risks of these agents are lacking. Findings from this large clinical trial will clarify the role of vitamin D and marine omega-3 fatty  acid supplements in the primary prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease in men and women.

Infrastructure support is needed to accrue an additional 2,700 new cancer cases over the next five years to accomplish the overall goal of conducting innovative research that evaluates how environmental and lifestyle exposures, and genetic susceptibility together affect cancer incidence, mortality and aging-related outcomes. In addition to collecting questionnaire information, these two Asian cohorts include an established biorepository with blood, buccal and urine samples from more than 50,000 participants. With the vigorous follow-up procedures in place, only 1.5 percent of the original cohort participants have been lost to follow-up. To date, approximately 17 percent of the cohort members were diagnosed with incident cancers; approximately 50 percent of the cancer patients have stored biospecimens. Researches evaluating the unique environmental and lifestyle exposures of the Asian cohort study populations have provided novel findings that contributed to the field of cancer etiology and prevention. These novel findings in part provided the rationale for our current chemoprevention trials in U.S. populations. During the next 5-year study period, we propose to: (1) Conduct core infrastructure activities to maintain and enhance the two Asian cohort databases, including: (a) follow-up for cancer, non-cancer and death outcomes, (b) maintenance of the biorepositories, and (c) management of the databases; (2) Conduct in-person and telephone interviews among cohort participants to update exposure and medical information; (3) Collect blood and urine samples from cohort participants with cancer diagnoses; and (4) Engage in collaborative research projects of the NCI and Asian Consortium Consortia. We anticipate that the established resources of the two Asian cohorts will become even more scientifically valuable over the next five years as the younger members of the cohorts enter into the age of maximal cancer incidence, thereby increasing the number of pre-disease biomarker-based research projects.          RELEVANCE: We are requesting infrastructure support for two established, population-based cancer epidemiology cohorts among Chinese men and women. The unique exposures and cancer risl< profiles of the Asian cohorts have been essential to identifying the protective effect  of specific dietary factors on cancer risk. These important findings have been used as a rationale for conducting cancer chemoprevention trials in U.S. populations.               ","We are requesting infrastructure support for two established, population-based prospective cancer  epidemiology cohorts, the Shanghai Cohort Study (SCS) and the Singapore Chinese Health Study (SCHS).  These Asian cohorts enrolled more than 80,000 Chinese men and women in late 1980s and early 1990s. The  National Cancer Institute (NCI) has funded the subject recruitment, biospecimen collection, biorepository  maintenance, and follow-up activities for the two cohorts since their inception. These Asian cohorts have been  actively followed for the occurrence of cancer and death since they were established over 20 years ago. To  date, over 14,000 or 17% of original cohort participants developed cancer, and over 22,000 or 27% of the  cohort participants died; cancer deaths accounted for 37% of total deaths. Through the tremendous integrated  efforts of our cohort investigator team and highly committed field-work teams, only 1,233, or 1.5% of cohort  participants have been lost to follow-up. The current infrastructure support for the two Asian cohorts is funded  by a Research Project Grant (R01 CA144032) that will end on 12/31/2()14. The unique exposures and cancer  risk profiles of these two Asian cohorts have been essential to the innovative cancer etiology and prevention  research our group has contributed that would have otherwise not been possible to conduct.  By utilizing the extensive resources of the two Asian cohorts, our research team has made important  contributions to the field of cancer etiology and prevention research. These contributions, published in over  150 peer-review articles (see Appendix B. Publication List), include providing key evidence to establish: (1)  dietary aflatoxins as human hepatocellular carcinogens; (2) the protective effect of dietary isothiocyanates on  the development of lung cancer; (3) the protective effect of retinol, choline and vitamin Be on the development  of hepatocellular carcinoma; and (4) the protective effect of green tea polyphenols on the development of  breast and gastric cancer. These important findings could not have been observed among U.S. populations, in  part because of the unique exposure and disease frequencies among the Shanghai and Singapore Chinese  populations. Furthermore, it is important to note that these findings from these two Asian cohort databases  are directly applicable to cancer prevention in U.S. populations. For example, we have launched two  randomized intervention studies in the U.S. to evaluate the efficacy of oral 2-phenethyl isothiocyanate  supplementation on the reduction of risk markers for lung carcinogenesis among smokers (R01 CAI 22244),  and to evaluate the efficacy of oral green tea extract supplementation on the reduction of risk markers for  breast cancer (ROl CA127236). Both of these intervention trials are based on our novel findings from the two  Asian cohorts. In other words, if there had been no such novel findings of protective effects of the two dietary  constituents on these cancers, there would have been no rationale to launch these two intervention studies in  U.S. populations.  We are requesting continued support for maintaining and enhancing the core infrastructure activities of the two  established cancer epidemiology cohorts. We have outlined a broad research agenda that will be achieved  upon receiving the continued support (described in B.4.). In summary, through the accrual of newly diagnosed  cancer patients with available pre-disease biospecimens, we will be able to enhance the established cohort  databases and initiate novel biomarker-based cancer etiologic research, participate in collaborative research in  the NCI cohort consortium and the Asian cohort consortium, and provide a unique resource for training the  next generation of cancer epidemiologists. We propose to accomplish the following specific activities during  the next 5-year study period, with oversight of the NCbl Program Director and members of the External Advisory  Board:  (1) Conduct core infrastructure activities to maintain and enhance the two Asian cohort databases. These  activities include: (a) follow-up for cancer, non-cancer and death outcomes; (b) maintenance of the  biorepositories at each study site; and (c) management of the databases.  (2) Conduct in-person and telephone interviews among cohort participants to update exposure information,  and collect new medical history information including medication use, diagnoses and hospitalizations.  (3) Collect blood and urine samples from cohort participants with recent diagnosis of breast, colorectal or  prostate cancer, and an equal number of control subjects (without cancer) for future research in the  area of cancer and aging.  (4) Engage in innovative research projects that include cohort-specific ancillary projects, as well as those  that involve data sharing activities with the NCI Cohort Consortium and the Asian Cohort Consortium.",

Vitamin D deficiency is widespread among HIV-infected adults and children. This is particularly alarming since there is a higher risk than the general population for complications like osteoporosis, non-AIDS-defining malignancies, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) - all diseases associated with vitamin D deficiency. It is not known how much vitamin D deficiency heightens the risk of complications like CVD, affects immune function and disease progression, or interferes with optimal treatment in the HIV population. The impact of vitamin D deficiency in the HIV population may be compounded even further since the etiology of HIV-related complications like CVD is thought to be related in part to inflammation and detrimental endothelial effects associated with chronic HIV infection-similar proposed mechanisms as vitamin D deficiency. Data suggest that optimal vitamin D status may be protective against these HIV-related complications, and optimizing vitamin D status with oral supplementation in HIV-infected individuals may improve the risk of HIV-related complications by decreasing inflammation and/or improving endothelial dysfunction, and may improve immune function even in individuals on antiretroviral therapy. Developing suitable repletion strategies is crucial to maximizing health status, particularly in HIV-infected children and young adults, where an opportunity exists for disease prevention. However, the best method of vitamin D repletion is not known, and data suggest that some antiretroviral medications interfere with vitamin D metabolism. Thus, we hypothesize that (1) optimizing vitamin D status to the current Institute of Medicine's (IOM) suggested 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration of e20 ng/mL improves CVD risk, inflammation, and CD4 cell counts in HIV-infected individuals, (2) increasing 25(OH)D concentrations to >30 ng/mL improves CVD risk and inflammation to a greater degree than increasing eto 20 ng/mL (the concentration some experts consider optimal for cardiovascular health), and (3) a 'high dose' of oral vitamin D is necessary to achieve 25(OH)D concentrations >30 ng/mL. These hypotheses will be addressed by determining the longitudinal relationships between serum 25(OH)D concentrations, carotid intima-media thickness, pulse wave velocity, pro-inflammatory biomarkers, and CD4 cell counts in HIV-infected children and young adults in a double-blinded, randomized-controlled trial of three different vitamin D dosing regimens given over 24 months in HIV-infected children and young adults (ages 10-25 years) with vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D <20 ng/mL). We will also evaluate the 25(OH)D concentrations from each arm after 6, 12, and 24 months of supplementation, in order to determine a dose-response relationship. These findings could have a sizable impact on health in this population, since vitamin D therapy is inexpensive and associated with few adverse side effects.

She is mentored by a committed, multidisciplinary team of senior investigators with extensive experience in both mentoring and in the research methodologies relevant to this proposal.

"5","R01","MH100219-02","Vitamin-D- PRODH- & DTNBP1-Induced Hyperprolinemia:Schizophrenia Risk & Treatment","","30-Nov-2018","CLELLAND, CATHERINE L","UNITED STATES","438534","2015","MH","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The highest known genetic risk of schizophrenia (SZ) is conferred by hemizygous microdeletion of chromosome 22q11. The proline dehydrogenase gene (PRODH) is located in the common deleted region, and encodes the enzyme that catalyzes proline catabolism. Proline is a neuromodulator at glutamatergic synapses, and the peripheral hyperprolinemia arising from PRODH mutations or CNVs encompassing PRODH, has been associated with cognitive impairment and decreased IQ. We recently reported a highly significant association of hyperprolinemia with SZ. We now provide evidence that two further independent SZ risk factors: Low vitamin-D status, and mutation of the dysbindin gene (Dtnbp1), also cause hyperprolinemia. Our findings suggest convergence of the biological pathways regulated by vitamin-D and DTNBP1, via loss of PRODH expression, with elevated proline as a common SZ endophenotype. Studies have documented the dysfunctional consequences of hyperprolinemia, such as aberrant glutamatergic and dopamine signaling leading to, for example, cognitive deficits and attenuated prepulse inhibition (PPI). Targeting hyperprolinemia in the Dtnbp1 model may therefore positively impact neurotransmitter signaling and restore function. This proposed study is designed to test our hypotheses under the following Specific Aims. Aim 1: To test the relative molecular contributions of low Vitamin D, and PRODH, and DTNBP1 gene variants, to SZ- associated hyperprolinemia. In a SZ patient and control sample (n=250), we will measure plasma proline and Vitamin-D levels, confirming the strong relationship between elevated proline and low Vitamin-D. From our preliminary data, we anticipate that 80% of the measured hyperprolinemia will arise from low vitamin-D, while DTNBP1 and PRODH variants will be responsible for the remaining 20%. Thus, we will perform molecular analyses on our complete study cohort (404 subjects), screening for PRODH, and DTNBP1 variants that alter gene expression, and testing for variant associations, plus interactions with low Vitamin-D, on the outcome of proline elevation. Aim 2: To examine the molecular pathway leading to hyperprolinemia in the Dtnbp1 model. Aim 2A. Molecular analyses will include assay of peripheral and CNS tissue expression of Prodh, p53 regulated genes, and Comt (downstream of Prodh), as well as of cortical, hippocampal and peripheral proline levels. Aim 2B. Utilizing primary neurons and astrocytes from sdy-/- and Prodh+/- mice, we will directly upregulate Prodh expression, via treatment with Vitamin D and the thiazolidinedione drug Rosiglitazone (RZG), testing for restoration of Prodh expression and decreased cellular proline. Aim 3: To target hyperprolinemia in the Dtnbp1 model in vivo. We will examine whether treatment with Vitamin D (Aim 3a), RZG (Aim 3b), and, to seek to reduce the impact of off-target effects, a proline-deficient diet (Aim 3c), compared to vehicle- treatment alone, restores the above pathway in vivo, and prevents or alleviates the Sdy-/- deficit in, for example, PPI and spatial working memory.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An enzyme called 'PRODH', which is encoded by the PRODH gene, normally breaks down the amino acid proline, and we recently found that a large proportion (26%) of people with schizophrenia have 'hyperprolinemia', which is high fasting levels of proline in the blood (and there is evidence that high proline has highly toxic effects in the brain). We have now discovered that two further schizophrenia risk factors- low vitamin-D and mutation of the gene 'DTNBP1', also cause hyperprolinemia, and under this proposed study we will measure the contributions of these risk factors to the development of hyperprolinemia in schizophrenia patients and in a mouse model system that also exhibits hyperprolinemia. We will then test if treatments that turn on the PRODH gene lead to a reduction in proline and rescue the behavioral and learning deficits seen in this mouse model, which if successful would provide compelling evidence for testing whether these treatments also reduce schizophrenia symptoms in this large patient group, and thus has very important public health implications.",

Sarcopenia is one of the largest public health problems facing a rapidly increasing, aging population in the United States and leads to increased incidence of falls, fractures and associated morbidities. Previous observations from our laboratory, as well as from many other laboratories, have demonstrated the efficacy of 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutyrate (HMB) alone or in combination with other amino acids in enhancing muscle strength and function in young athletes. We have recently demonstrated that the combination of HMB with two other amino acids, arginine and lysine, was effective in increasing muscle mass in elderly men and women during a year-long prospective study. When analyzing the data (Preliminary Results), we demonstrated a close correlation between the levels of 25-OH Vitamin D3 in this population and the level of improvement in muscle strength. We noted that individuals with plasma 25-OH Vitamin D3 levels >30 ng/ml manifested muscle strength gains supplemented with HMB and two amino acids, while those with plasma 25- OH Vitamin D3 of <30 ng/ml did not. These data form the basis of our current hypothesis that the combination of HMB and Vitamin D supplementation will be synergistic and will result in significant enhancements in overall muscle strength, function and muscle mass. We propose these Phase I and Phase II studies to prove our hypothesis. The Phase I study will test the short-term (12-wk) efficacy of a combination of HMB and Vitamin D to prevent and reverse muscle sarcopenia and the associated losses of muscular strength and functionality in older adults. We plan to recruit 100 men and women who will be assigned to one of four dietary treatments: (1) Control; (2) HMB (calcium salt), 3.0 g/day; (3) 2,000 IU Vitamin D; and (4) HMB, 3.0 g/d + 2,000 IU Vitamin D. The subjects will undergo a 3-day per week exercise program, and body composition and strength will be measured at four week intervals. We expect to demonstrate the synergy between HMB and Vitamin D in this short study. Phase II will test the long-term (12-mos) efficacy of this synergistic combination of HMB and Vitamin D on the enhancement of muscle strength and functionality in the elderly, thus leading to improved quality of life. Phase II will include an exercise arm just like Phase I, but will also include a non-exercise arm because many elderly adults do not participate in an exercise program. In addition to body composition and function and strength data, muscle biopsies will be obtained and muscle fiber and proteomic analysis will be performed. We anticipate that the data generated will lead to further research looking at mechanism(s) involved in loss of muscle and muscle function in the elderly. Improvement in muscle strength and muscle function as well as improvements in body composition over the year-long study will be used to market a product containing HMB and Vitamin D.      ","Current estimates place a large portion of the older U.S. populous at risk for falls with potential morbidities. A large percentage of these falls are directly related to decreased muscle strength and function. Since a significant portion of the older population is at risk of having a Vitamin D deficiency, a product that corrects such deficiencies and specifically targets muscle strength, function, and mass is likely to produce significant improvements in health, improve the quality of life, and in particular, help to decrease the incidence of falls and injury in this group. Moreover, based upon the incidence of widespread Vitamin D deficiency in all ages, we anticipate the younger population will also benefit from similar supplementation.",

In the US, close to 48 million people contract AGE and 128,000 are hospitalized each year . Episodes of AGE can result in substantial morbidity to children and their families. In addition, the costs to caregivers, the health-care system, and society are significant. At present, treatment options are limited and targeted at symptom management rather than disease modification. Probiotics - live microbial cultures which, when consumed in adequate amounts, confer documented health benefits - may be an ideal solution. They are hypothesized to work via a combination of direct microbiologic and immunologic mechanisms. Probiotics have shown promise in early clinical research in hospitalized children in developing countries. These early efforts are limited by small samples, outcomes lacking relevance to outpatients, poor methodology and absence of side effect reporting; thus, the potential role of probiotics remains poorly defined and practice guidelines do not endorse their use. There are current trends, however, that obligate an urgent assessment of these agents. First, probiotic manufacturers have embarked in aggressive public marketing strategies that make health claims that may not be supported by rigorous research, and the world-wide market for probiotic products is growing steadily (projected growth 2009-2014 12.6% for a total of US $32.6 billion/year). Second, government agencies (US FDA and European Food safety Authority (EFSA)) remain concerned about their value and safety. Third, some institutions are now recommending the use of probiotics based on potentially flawed or limited evidence. Fourth, parents of patients with AGE are often medicating their children without guidance from medical professionals. We are therefore concerned that probiotic consumption is increasing without solid evidence to support its use, which underscores the necessity to conduct a definitive trial without delay. Objectives - The overall objective of this multi-national randomized clinical trial is to determine if a specific probiotic agent, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG(LGG), the most widely available, studied and regulated probiotic in the US, should routinely be administered to outpatient children who are suffering from AGE. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) to determine the clinical effectiveness of LGG and (2) to determine the safety and side effect profile of LGG in children 3-48 months of age presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with AGE. Study Setting & Design - The study will be conducted in 8 US pediatric emergency departments within the federally funded Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN). We will randomize 900 children to receive 5 days of a probiotic agent (LGG 1 x 1010 CFU twice a day) or placebo. The main outcome is the occurrence of moderate-severe disease as defined by the Modified Vesikari Score, a validated clinical severity score, which incorporates the frequency and duration of diarrhea, frequency and duration of vomiting, height of fever, need for future health-care visits and medical interventions provided. We will also assess the occurrence of adverse events and side effects related to the use of LGG. We will collect stool samples to conduct mechanism of action studies as well as economic data to conduct cost effectiveness analyses in the future. Impact - This study will directly inform clinica practice by providing the first definitive evidence to support recommendations for or against the routine use of probiotics in the treatment of pediatric AGE. In addition it will provide health-car practitioners and policy makers with (a) a clear picture on the potential side effects from probiotic use, and with the data collected (b) knowledge on the mechanism of action and (c) of the potential economic impact of probiotic use on health-care systems and society. Thus, the potential clinical and societal impacts of the proposed study are substantial and the results will guide the standard of care: if positive, guidelines will be able to endorse probiotic administratio with important positive consequences for the health of several million US children annually. Moreover, if beneficial the cost savings to the health-care system and society may be substantial. If the results are negative, a firm recommendation against the routine use of probiotics would be justified. Collaborators - This work is collaboration between leaders in multicenter and AGE research (Schnadower, Freedman, Tarr, Gorelick, Mahajan, Stanley, Roskind, Powell, O'Connel, Ruddy Chun, Levine and Casper) in prestigious Children's Hospitals within a federally funded multicenter network (PECARN) with a strong record in conducting high quality, high impact clinical trials.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Gastroenteritis, or intestinal infection, which usually manifests as vomiting and diarrhea, is one of the most common illnesses of childhood. It causes over 1.7 million deaths per year worldwide. In the United States, it is rarely fatal, however it results in .4 million doctor visits and 128,000 hospitalizations per year and constitutes a significant burden for patients, their families and society. Currently, available treatments for this condition are aimed only at the symptoms and complications (e.g. dehydration) and not at modifying the disease process. We propose to study the effectiveness and side effects of a probiotic, LGG, in treating children with gastroenteritis. If successful, this therapeutic intervention would be the frst treatment that actually changes the disease process and would represent an enormous public health advance both in the US, and potentially, globally.",

In the United States, HCV is the most common chronic blood borne infection affecting 1.8% of the population and appears to be the major etiologic factor responsible for the recent doubling of HCC in the United States. Current therapy consists of pegylated interferon-1 (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV). 70% of patients in the United States are infected with genotype 1 for which sustained virologic response (SVR) is only 42-46%. Generally, therapy of all genotypes can be accompanied by adverse effects and contraindications to therapy are not infrequent. For these reasons there is the need to develop additional therapies that are less toxic and result in higher SVR either as adjuncts or replacement therapies. We have identified the heat shock proteins (HSP)s HSP40 and HSP70 in complex with the HCV encoded protein NS5A through mass spectrometric analysis. We confirmed an NS5A/HSP interaction by confocal microscopy and coimmunoprecipitation. HSP40 and HSP70 knockdown both reduced infectious viral particle production in a HCV cell culture system. Treatment with the heat shock protein synthesis inhibitors Quercetin and KNK437 reduced infectious particle production at non-toxic concentrations. This striking inhibition of virus production combined with its known low toxicity and use in previous and ongoing clinical trials serves to motivate this bench to bedside proposal to study treat HCV infected patients with Quercetin. In this proposal, our goals are to further understand the impact of HSP40 and HSP70 and heat shock protein synthesis inhibitors on HCV infection and determine Quercetin's safety and antiviral activity in patients suffering from chronic HCV infection in a phase I clinical trial. To achieve this we propose three interrelated specific aims: 1. We will determine the importance of heat shock proteins 40 and 70 in hepatitis C virus production in the HCVcc model. 2. We will determine the impact of heat shock protein synthesis inhibitors on hepatitis C viral infection in the HCVcc model. We will test the clinical feasibility of the heat shock protein synthesis inhibitor Quercetin on patients with chronic hepatitis C viral infection through a phase I trial. Further understanding of heat shock proteins and heat shock protein synthesis inhibition in HCV infection may allow for successful treatment of chronic hepatitis C and reduce the incidence of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic hepatitis C viral (HCV) infection is the number one causative agent of cirrhosis necessitating liver transplantation and is the major cause of the recent doubling of hepatocellular carcinoma in the United States.

Despite food fortification and dietary supplementation, vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency is still relativly common in the US. Many epidemiologic studies consistently found that low vitamin D status was associated with increased risks of non-skeletal chronic diseases including colorectal cancer (CRC). However, randomized clinical trials generated inconsistent results. One striking observation is that a large portion of the inter-person variation in serum 25- hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels is unexplained. Further, there is a substantial inter-individual variation in serum 25(OH)D in response to the same dose of vitamin D supplementation. Mg plays a critical role in the synthesis and metabolism of vitamin D. The activities of 3 key enzymes determining 25(OH)D level may be Mg-dependent. Further, Mg deficiency has been implicated in 'Mg-dependent vitamin-D-resistant rickets' and Mg supplementation substantially reversed resistance to vitamin D treatment. Very recently, we found intake of Mg significantly interacted with intake of vitamin D in relation to risks of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency. Furthermore, we found the associations of serum 25(OH)D with mortality, including mortality due to CRC, may be modified by Mg intake, and the reduction in risk associated with high serum concentrations of 25(OH)D appeared primarily among those with Mg intake e median. Our novel finding of Mg-vitamin D interaction may explain some of the variability in 25(OH)D levels and may provide another possible interpretation to explain previous inconsistencies. Very recently, an animal study found the Mg-deficient diet significantly reduced the mRNA of the enzyme that primarily converts 25(OH)D to its active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)D), and significantly increased mRNA expression of the enzyme which mainly converts 25(OH)D to 24,25- dihydroxyvitamin D (24,25(OH)D). Further, a randomized clinical trial of vitamin D supplementation observed changes in vitamin D metabolite conversion with a significant increase in conversion of 25(OH)D to 24,25(OH)D. However, the ratio of serum 24,25(OH)D to serum 25(OH)D was only temporarily and slightly affected by vitamin D supplementation. Furthermore, the initial ratio predicted the efficacy of vitamin D treatment (i.e.  rise in 25(OH)D). Based on these findings, we hypothesize that Mg supplementation reduces 24,25(OH)D and the ratio of 24,25(OH)D/ 25(OH)D (two markers of Mg deficiency), and, thus, improves resistance to vitamin D and reduces risk of CRC. To test hypothesis, we propose to measure serum levels of 24,25(OH)D, 25(OH)D, and 1,25 (OH)D in samples collected prior to and at the conclusion of a 12-week Mg intervention in 180 individuals (90 Mg-treatment and 90 placebo). This study will be the first to evaluate the effect of Mg supplementation on resistance to vitamin D and will lay the foundation for future prevention trials.          ","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will investigate the effect of magnesium treatment on change in vitamin D metabolite levels and ratio. This study is very critical to understand whether vitamin D metabolism and vitamin D resistance (i.e. insensitivity to vitamin D supplementation) can be improved by magnesium supplementation and to translate it into a preventive strategy for colorectal cancer and, possibly, other cancers. Thus, the proposed study has profound public health and clinical implications.               ",

Early life and prenatal exposures contribute to the development of these disorders. Pre- and perinatal exposures may confer risk through epigenetic mechanisms, heritable changes in gene expression that occur without directly altering the DNA sequence. While there are several epigenetic mechanisms, DNA methylation is most commonly studied, and the methylation state at certain sites may affect gene activity and expression. Epigenetic patterns are sensitive to environmental exposures and they lie at the interface of the environment and gene expression. It remains unclear, however, whether such changes are causal for disease or whether they are a secondary outcome of the disease. Regardless of mechanisms, finding correlations between disease and methylation patterns on easily accessible materials (such as DNA from cord blood) is important due to the potential utility as biomarkers of disease susceptibility. The overall hypothesis of this application is that DNA methylation changes that occur in early life will affect the risk for developing allergic disorders in childhood, and that epigenetic signatures in cord blood DNA can be used as a biomarker for these childhood outcomes. We will conduct studies to test this hypothesis in a longitudinal birth cohort, Project Viva, in which we have extensive information on prenatal diet and other exposures, cord blood DNA samples collected at birth, and allergic outcomes in childhood. After the screening and validation, we will perform replication studies in two separate birth cohorts: MeDALL(Mechanisms of the Development of Allergy) and Generation R. Our specific aims are: (1) to identify novel regions in the epigenome that are differentially methylated in allergic versus non-allergic children. We will use a high-throughput genome-wide methylation panel and cord blood DNA samples in ~700 subjects from Project Viva and determine regions that are differentially methylated in children with and without allergic outcomes at 7 yrs. of age, and replicate these findings in MeDALL and Generation R. Pyrosequencing will be used to validate associated methylation marks in cord blood, and to assess longitudinal stability of the marks in DNA from ages 3 and 7. (2) To examine whether prenatal exposures such as prenatal diet (antioxidants, primarily vitamin E), maternal smoking, and exposure to ambient air pollution affect differential methylation of genes related to allergic outcomes. (3)To examine whether post-natal exposures such as child's diet, supplement intake, and exposure to air pollution modify the association between differential methylation in cord blood DNA and allergy outcomes in childhood. Our project uses state-of-the-art epigenetic screening methods in 3 prospective longitudinal birth cohorts; such an approach may identify an epigenetic signature programmed in utero that predicts allergic outcomes in childhood, which could allow for more timely and targeted detection and prevention measures.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Environmental exposures have been shown to have a great impact on the development of allergic/atopic disorders and epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation have been proposed as mediators of the environmental effects. In this study, we propose to identify epigenetic markers in cord blood samples that may predict which children will develop allergic disorders. In doing so, we may be able to determine ways in which to prevent the development of allergic disorders.",

A major breakthrough for prevention and cure has been the appreciation that breast cancer is not one disease, rather a collection of cancer subtypes becoming better defined by improved methodologies based upon histopathologic, genetic and molecular signatures. Over time we have applied histological type, grade, tumor size, lymph-node involvement, and estrogen receptor (ER) and HER-2/neu receptor status to help define prognosis and probability of response to therapies, yet these alone have not fully captured the varied behavior of breast cancer. The field is now rapidly progressing with gene expression and proteomic signatures that will help 'personalize' our interventions for individuals. This same concept is relevant to interventions for primary or secondary prevention and is the focus of our translational grant application. Our pre-clinical studies have demonstrated a strong benefit for dietary ω-3 fatty acid rich fish oil for the inhibition of ERPR(-)HER-2/neu(+) mammary tumors in a transgenic mouse model showing decreased tumor incidence, multiplicity and glandular atypia. Thus, our central hypothesis is that the development of aggressive breast cancer sub-types such as of ERPR(-)HER-2/neu(+) or ERPR(-)HER-2/neu(-) (i.e. triple negative) disease may be uniquely responsive to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), the long chain ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) found in fish oil. As a first step towards a future definitive prevention trial in women, we propose to test the efficacy of an ω-3 rich fish il supplement to modulate breast biomarkers indicative of anti-carcinogenic action. We will randomize high risk survivors to a placebo-low dose or high dose ω-3 rich fish oil capsule treatment and employ our breast fine needle aspiration techniques to obtain cells and tissue for analysis of biomarkers of exposure and efficacy. Our multidisciplinary team has developed the following Specific Aims to: (1) Determine the effects of dietary ω-3 fatty acids on biomarkers of exposure and response in women at high risk for recurrent estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor breast cancer +/- HER-2/neu overexpression; and (2) Define the role of dietary ω-3 PUFAs in the epigenetic regulation of the inflammatory responses underlying mammary carcinogenesis as a novel mechanism for the effects of ω-3 PUFAs. Development of these biomarkers of ω-3 PUFA exposure and response will enable the assessment of this bioactive food component in future large-scale prevention trials for women at risk for recurrence of ERPR(-)HER-2/neu(+) or triple negative breast cancer.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The genetic and molecular heterogeneity of breast cancer accounts for wide variability in clinical response and outcome and thus mandates the development of innovative targeted therapies and prevention strategies. The unresolved role of dietary fat content and specifically ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in human breast carcinogenesis, despite compelling pre-clinical studies, raises the possibility that response to dietary fat depends on critical nutrient-gene interactions that may vary between subjects and/or breast cancer subtypes. This study aims to determine the effects of dietary ω-3 fatty acids on biomarkers of exposure and response in women at high risk for recurrent estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor negative breast cancer +/- HER- 2/neu overexpression and their role in the epigenetic regulation of the inflammatory responses underlying mammary carcinogenesis.",

Total body fat will be ascertained by Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry to examine the confounding effects of adiposity on outcome measures. Innovative aspects of this proposal include (1) characterizing the temporal changes in vascular health and cardiometabolic risk outcomes in response to enhancement of vitamin D status in a population of children at high-risk for vascular dysfunction and cardiometabolic risks; and (2) delineating the vitamin D effects on inflammatory markers and adipokines relevant to CVD risk. Establishing the protective benefits of vitamin D would have major public health importance, since optimization of vitamin D status would be an inexpensive primary prevention strategy for improving cardiometabolic health during childhood and for reducing CVD risk during adulthood.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal is relevant to public health because demonstrating the cardiovascular and metabolic benefits of vitamin D status enhancement could have significant public health impact - as vitamin D status optimization could be implemented as an inexpensive primary prevention strategy for improving cardiovascular health.",

A number of factors (metabolism, energy balance, aspirin, vitamin D) have been  associated with CRC risk, and substantial intersections exist between nutrient excess, derangements in  cellular and molecular mediators of inflammation, and vitamin D insufficiency, which jointly appear to drive  CRC development and progression. Nonetheless, there remains a critical need to further investigate these  interventions before clinical translation. We will leverage the resources of 3 unique and rich study populations  to pursue innovative conceptual and technical approaches, which have not been or only rarely used to date to  study CRC. Specifically, using two large cohorts of women (NHS) and men (HPFS) with >35 years of follow-  up, we will examine underlying mechanistic pathways by incorporating metabolomic profiles, tumoral gene  expression and whole exome sequencing data to understand and further define strategies for improving CRC  prevention and treatment. Beyond our hypothesis-based work, we will further leverage these innovative and  novel platforms to systemically identify new targets for prevention and therapy. Moreover, building on our  extensive published observational work in these cohorts assessing the role of vitamin D in colorectal  carcinogenesis, we will now examine the influence of vitamin D supplementation on risk of colorectal adenoma  within a large, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial (RCT; the VITAL study), which oversampled for  African-Americans due to their higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. Finally, among NHS and HPFS  participants diagnosed with CRC, we will examine the relation of these modifiable factors to survival following  CRC treatment. We are uniquely positioned to address these critical research questions in these well-  established study cohorts with long-term follow-up, archived blood and tissue specimens, a validated  metabolomics platform, and the ability to evaluate post-diagnostic exposures while controlling for pre-  diagnostic behaviors. Findings from this novel, comprehensive investigation will substantially enhance our  understanding of CRC etiology, its molecular subtypes, and survival. Identifying modifiable factors to improve  CRC survival has potential translational implications through changes in clinical recommendations.

Vitamin D deficiency is more common among African American (AA) individuals, especially those from urban environments or with obesity. We and others have contributed to increasing evidence that vitamin D insufficiency may contribute to more severe asthma through increased risk of respiratory infection and decreased glucocorticoid sensitivity. Indeed, low vitamin D levels were recently linked with the need for exogenous glucocorticoids and increased asthma severity. Particularly relevant to health disparities, we showed a strong association between vitamin D insufficiency and asthma in urban African American (AA) youth. Because AA youth residing in urban Washington, DC have markedly worse asthma than other racial/ethnic groups (e.g. prevalence rate 20% higher than the national rate 15 and emergency department utilization rates up to 5 times the national rates and nearly 10 times the Healthy People 2010 target rate), we will utilize our access to this population at the extreme of asthma disparities to examine the contribution of vitamin D to disparities in the chronic control and acute severity of asthma. The overall goal of this application is to provide critical epidemiological/molecular information that will inform the interpretation of ongoing and impending randomized clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation in asthma, especially with regard to urban AA youth with asthma. The knowledge generated by the experiments in this application will be crucial to translation of this inexpensive, easily-accessible potential therapy for asthma.

Folate pharmacogenetics, allows us to mechanistically study AAP metabolic complications and develop personalized medicine within clinical practice. The objective of this project is to compare the effect of folate versus placebo on measures of the metabolic syndrome and CVD risk factors. We will evaluate metabolic laboratory components, and endothelial functioning, in schizophrenia patients receiving AAPs, taking into account pharmacogenetic differences related to folate metabolism. Our primary hypothesis is that folate will attenuate metabolic changes associated with AAP use, thereby contributing to improve endothelial functioning. Variation within the genes facilitating folate metabolism (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and catechol-o-methyl transferase (COMT)) modulate these improvements. We have formulated this hypothesis based on our pilot data obtained during R01MH082784 showing AAPs increase metabolic syndrome risk due to an interaction with MTHFR and COMT. We performed an open-label 3-month folate supplement trial and found significant reductions in metabolic measures and significantly reduced the number of subjects meeting endothelial dysfunction criteria. These improvements were modulated through MTHFR and COMT. The specific aims for this proposal are: 1) Evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness of folic acid supplementation (5mg/day) versus placebo for 16 weeks in schizophrenia subjects and measure sustainability of this effect 8 weeks after supplementation withdrawal, 2) Determine the role of MTHFR and COMT variants on endothelial functioning and metabolic improvements seen with folate supplementation. The innovative approach capitalizes upon a novel strategy to reduce AAP metabolic risks using a novel non-invasive endothelial functioning measurement as a biomarker. This allows for an overall CVD risk estimation compared to focusing on solely weight loss and glucose regulation.

Understanding how these spillovers work within the household could enable the design of smarter health policies which take into account households' optimal readjustments. But we cannot fully measure these reallocation responses without data on dietary intake, which is arguably the most important health resource, especially for children in low-income settings. I propose to 1) acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to collect such data, and 2) use it to analyze the effects of nutrition interventions on the intra-household distribution of food and other health resources.  To accomplish the first goal, I will engage in three training activities which will enable me to learn about key concepts in nutritional science and measurement issues in dietary intake assessment in low-income settings: 1) coursework, 2) mentoring meetings, and 3) dissemination of my work. To accomplish the second, I will engage in a research program related to understanding the intra-household spillovers of targeted nutrition interventions, focusing on iodine supplementation.  Iodine deficiency disorder (IDD) has significant and irreversible effects on cognitive development.  One third of the global population has IDD. Low in utero exposure to iodine leads to reduced intelligence quotients, and in severe cases can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm delivery and growth, hearing and speech problems. Iodine supplementation and fortification programs-both in utero and in early childhood-have been proven to increase child health and cognitive ability, and are thus often used as policy tools in affected areas. Supplementation programs are usually targeted towards pregnant women and young children. However, little is known about how these interventions affect other children in the household who are not targeted.  My research program has 3 specific aims: 1) collect novel data which combine socioeconomic and demographic information with dietary intake measurements for every child in the household; 2) document the patterns of intra-household allocation of food and other health resources; and 3) study the effects of fetal and early childhood iodine supplementation interventions on the intra-household distribution of food and other health resources amongst children.  I will accomplish the first aim by designing a dietary intake assessment module and integrating it into a large-scale household panel survey in Ghana. I will accomplish Aim 2 by performing preliminary analyses with these new data. I will accomplish the last aim through two studies. In the first, I will study the effects of a large feta iodine supplementation program in Tanzania using an existing, nationally representative dataset. In this study, I will apply econometric techniques developed for intra-household analyses to examine whether children exposed to more iodine while in utero receive more health resources than their untreated siblings during childhood. In the second study, I will implement and analyze data from a pilot field experiment that will distribute iodine supplements to children under 5 in Ghana. The experiment will run concurrently with the panel survey data collection, allowing me to measure the resulting changes in dietary intake and other health resource allocations.  Without quantifying the household responses to childhood nutrition interventions, particularly in the context of iodine supplementation policies, it is impossible to know the full impact of these programs. Answering this question-are we helping or hurting other children in the household through targeted interventions?-is essential to the design and improved cost-benefit analysis of childhood nutrition programs around the world.

These co-morbidities have been linked to persistently elevated serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines that mimic an aging phenotype known as 'inflamm-aging.' In both  middle-aged HIV+ persons and older HIV seronegative adults, inflamm-aging is associated with more limited  T cell repertoires and increased risk for morbidities and mortality. Our hypothesis is that inflamm-aging is  responsible for the premature immune senescence associated with HIV infection in aging individuals.  Immune senescence, characterized by diminished replicative capacity, has been observed in middle-aged  persons treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (H/VKRT) who achieve immune reconstitution and  undetectable viral loads. Senescent cells are characterized bythe absence ofthe surface marker CD28,  and in advanced senescence express CD57 (CD28-/CD57+ phenotype). Fish oil may be an effective  treatment option for reducing HIV-related inflamm-aging. Cold water fish are rich in the omega-3 fatty acids  eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which have anti-inflammatory effects.. We  propose a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to explore the safety and estimate the  effect size of fish oil to modulate parameters of inflamm-aging and immune senescence in a  well-characterized cohort of 38 HIV+ AA. Participants will be between the ages of 50 and 65, on stable  H/\ART, and with inflammation evidenced by elevated plasma concentrations of interleukln-6 (IL-6) or high  sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). Participants will be recruited from the Rush Center of Excellence on  Disparities in HIV and Aging (Rush CEDHA). Each participant will be randomized to receive either 1.2  grams daily of EPA and DHA (600 mg of EPA and 600 mg of DHA), or a placebo identical in appearance for  12 weeks. We will measure (a) soluble markers of inflammation: TNF-alpha, lL-6, and gamma IFN; and (b)  markers of immune senescence: CD28 and CD57 expression on CD8+ and CD4+ T lymphocyte cells. At  baseline and 4 and 12 weeks post-baseline, we will measure safety parameters.","RELEVANCE (See instructions):  HIV infection is associated with chronic inflammation which can lead to the premature onset of immune aging in middle aged persons.

There is currently no effective treatment. Sirtuin 1 is upregulated in the kidney i murine models of PKD and acts as a deacetylase of retinoblastoma protein (Rb, leading to its phosphorylation) and p53, which together drive uncontrolled epithelial proliferation and cystogenesis. Inhibition of SIRT1 with nicotinamide, a component of vitamin B3, retards progression of PKD in mice. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that nicotinamide can inhibit SIRT1 deacetylase activity and safely and effectively retard cyst enlargement and disease progression in patients with PKD. Nicotinamide is a particularly attractive candidate for treatment of PKD because it has a well-established safety profile and, as a nutritional supplement, it does not require FDA approval. Thus, if it can be proven to be effective, PKD patients would have access to its use immediately.  The goal of this pilot study is to provide initial estimates of the biological and clinical efficacy of nicotinamide in patients with PKD. The  resulting estimates will provide critical information to determine if we can detect any hint of a beneficial clinical effect on cyst progression and provide a plausible range of effect sizes for th design of a subsequent, larger, confirmatory trial. We propose to enroll 30 adult subjects with PKD in a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of nicotinamide, 30 mg/kg/d orally.

Obesity is a complex disorder and there are likely multiple causative factors emerging at various times through life. We have previously demonstrated in preclinical studies that offspring have altered metabolism when the fetuses are exposed to the consequences of maternal obesity in utero. The major effects relate to how the offspring metabolize energy and store excess energy. Offspring of obese women can spare and store more ingested energy as excess fat than offspring of lean women who burn more of their energy. Preliminary data from our ongoing clinical studies show that offspring of overweight women have increased fat mass at age 2 weeks and increased weight at age 2 years. One in two American infants will have been exposed to adverse metabolic conditions while developing in utero, and this increases the risk of developing obesity later in life. Although weight loss prior to pregnancy would be the preferred line of action, in light of the high incidence of unplanned pregnancies and the low success rate of significant weight loss among women, one critical strategy is to develop interventions during pregnancy to prevent childhood obesity.  The objective of this proposal is to test an intervention that would reduce the effect of maternal obesity on the offspring and therefore prevent their risk of developing childhood obesity. The proposed study will test the efficacy of probiotics supplementation during pregnancy on preventing childhood obesity. To test these hypotheses we have designed a prospective randomized double blinded control trial. For this study we will recruit 104 obese women within the first 12 weeks of gestation and follow them throughout pregnancy and during their child's first two weeks of life. The obese women will be randomized to either a placebo (N=52) or to an intervention group (N=52). The intervention group will consist of a daily probiotic supplementation, whereas the control group will be administered a placebo. During the length of the study we will: carefully quantify maternal and child adiposity (fat mass); study maternal metabolism (dietary intake and energy expenditure); acquire dietary intakes and evaluate circulating levels of key metabolic markers. The specific aims will first demonstrate the potential for a probiotic intervention during gestation to improve maternal glucose use in obese women. For this aim, maternal fasting glucose and insulin levels will be assessed throughout pregnancy in the intervention group compared to the placebo group. The specific aims will also test whether a probiotic intervention during pregnancy in obese women alter offspring fat mass and decrease the risk of obesity in the offspring. To answer these questions, placenta, umbilical cord and cord blood will be obtained to study glucose, insulin and gene expression.","No data",

ADT is associated with a 5- to 10-fold greater loss of bone mineral density (BMD), a 7-fold increase in bone fractures, and a significant increase in sarcopenia (muscle mass atrophy) compared to age-matched prostate cancer patients not on ADT and men without cancer. The loss of BMD and muscle mass is associated with a high prevalence of physical deficits such as falls, reduced muscular strength, and decreased balance. Despite the high prevalence of ADT-related side effects, treatment options are limited. Bisphosphonate therapy is an effective treatment for ADT-induced bone loss, but is not indicated for the prevention of bone loss. Vitamin D protects against BMD loss and fractures, but its effects are strongly dose-dependent. Current IOM recommended supplementation (600 IU/day) and serum 25-OH levels (20 ng/mL) are inadequate to protect against bone loss in a high risk population such as prostate cancer patients on ADT, as evidenced by increased BMD with serum 25-OH vitamin D levels e32 ng/mL. In addition, RCT interventions of 400-500 IU/day of vitamin D failed to prevent ADT-induced bone loss. High-dose vitamin D supplementation (e.g., 50,000 IU/week) is a promising intervention that significantly increases 25-OH vitamin D to levels shown to improve BMD. Vitamin D has also been shown to increase muscular strength, reduce falls, and improve balance. Preliminary data from our group in 190 cancer patients demonstrates high-dose vitamin D supplementation (e50,000 IU/week) for 6 months in prostate cancer patients receiving treatment (e.g., ADT,             chemotherapy) is safe and well-tolerated. Other preliminary data from our group also show high-dose vitamin D supplementation (50,000 IU/week) in cancer patients significantly increases 25-OH vitamin D levels while low-dose vitamin supplementation (7,000 IU/week) does not. Based on biological plausibility and our preliminary data, we propose to conduct a two-arm randomized controlled trial in which 76 prostate cancer patients 65 years old and older on ADT will be randomized to receive 1) 50,000 IU/week vitamin D or 2) a matching placebo. All participants will receive a daily multivitamin (600 IU vitamin D) and a 1,000 mg/day calcium supplement to ensure a minimum of 100% RDA.

This study would represent one of first clinical trials to examine the effect of high-dose vitamin D supplementation on ADT-related side effects in older prostate cancer patients.

Sarcopenia is one of the largest public health problems facing a rapidly increasing, aging population in the United States and leads to increased incidence of falls, fractures and associated morbidities. Previous observations from our laboratory, as well as from many other laboratories, have demonstrated the efficacy of 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutyrate (HMB) alone or in combination with other amino acids in enhancing muscle strength and function in young athletes. We have recently demonstrated that the combination of HMB with two other amino acids, arginine and lysine, was effective in increasing muscle mass in elderly men and women during a year-long prospective study. When analyzing the data (Preliminary Results), we demonstrated a close correlation between the levels of 25-OH Vitamin D3 in this population and the level of improvement in muscle strength. We noted that individuals with plasma 25-OH Vitamin D3 levels >30 ng/ml manifested muscle strength gains supplemented with HMB and two amino acids, while those with plasma 25- OH Vitamin D3 of <30 ng/ml did not. These data form the basis of our current hypothesis that the combination of HMB and Vitamin D supplementation will be synergistic and will result in significant enhancements in overall muscle strength, function and muscle mass. We propose these Phase I and Phase II studies to prove our hypothesis. The Phase I study will test the short-term (12-wk) efficacy of a combination of HMB and Vitamin D to prevent and reverse muscle sarcopenia and the associated losses of muscular strength and functionality in older adults. We plan to recruit 100 men and women who will be assigned to one of four dietary treatments: (1) Control; (2) HMB (calcium salt), 3.0 g/day; (3) 2,000 IU Vitamin D; and (4) HMB, 3.0 g/d + 2,000 IU Vitamin D. The subjects will undergo a 3-day per week exercise program, and body composition and strength will be measured at four week intervals. We expect to demonstrate the synergy between HMB and Vitamin D in this short study. Phase II will test the long-term (12-mos) efficacy of this synergistic combination of HMB and Vitamin D on the enhancement of muscle strength and functionality in the elderly, thus leading to improved quality of life. Phase II will include an exercise arm just like Phase I, but will also include a non-exercise arm because many elderly adults do not participate in an exercise program. In addition to body composition and function and strength data, muscle biopsies will be obtained and muscle fiber and proteomic analysis will be performed. We anticipate that the data generated will lead to further research looking at mechanism(s) involved in loss of muscle and muscle function in the elderly. Improvement in muscle strength and muscle function as well as improvements in body composition over the year-long study will be used to market a product containing HMB and Vitamin D.","Current estimates place a large portion of the older U.S. populous at risk for falls with potential morbidities. A large percentage of these falls are directly related to decreased muscle strength and function. Since a significant portion of the older population is at risk of having a Vitamin D deficiency, a product that corrects such deficiencies and specifically targets muscle strength, function, and mass is likely to produce significant improvements in health, improve the quality of life, and in particular, help to decrease the incidence of falls and injury in this group. Moreover, based upon the incidence of widespread Vitamin D deficiency in all ages, we anticipate the younger population will also benefit from similar supplementation.",

The underlying mechanism of salt-sensitivity is not fully understood. The overall objective of the proposed study is to investigate the association of urinary excretion of angiotensinogen (AGT), kallikrein, dopamine, norepinephrine, and albumin with salt-sensitivity and potassium-sensitivity of BP and risk of hypertension. The Genetic Epidemiology Network of Salt Sensitivity (GenSalt) is an NHLBI-sponsored dietary feeding-study conducted among 1,906 participants living in rural China during October 2003-July 2005. The dietary interventions included a 7-day low-sodium feeding (51.3 mmol/day), a 7-day high-sodium feeding (307.8 mmol/day), and a 7-day high-sodium feeding with oral potassium supplementation (60 mmol/day). BP measurements were obtained on each of 3 days during the baseline and each of the 3 intervention periods. Two follow-up examinations to investigate the incidence of hypertension were conducted in the GenSalt study participants during August 2008-December 2009 and August 2011-May 2012. The GenSalt-replication study was conducted among 698 participants living in the same region using an identical study protocol from April to November of 2010.

To achieve these specific aims, we will measure urinary AGT, kallikrein, dopamine, norepinephrine, and albumin in the frozen-stored 24-hour urinary samples from the GenSalt and GenSalt-replication study participants; analyze the association of urinary excretion of biomarkers at baseline and during dietary interventions with BP responses to dietary sodium and potassium interventions in 2,604 GenSalt and GenSalt-replication study participants; and analyze the prospective relationship of urinary excretion of biomarkers at baseline and during dietary interventions with subsequent risk of hypertension in 1,906 GenSalt study participants with follow-up data on BP. The proposed study is very timely and cost-effective, because it uses the rich resources and research infrastructure of the GenSalt study. This study will be the first large investigation to examine th association between multiple urinary biomarkers and risk of salt-sensitive hypertension.

Diabetes affects 1 in 10 persons in the United States and is projected to increase to 1 in 4 persons by 2050. Women with type 2 diabetes have worse outcomes than men with type 2 diabetes. This may be due to depression which affects over 25% of women with diabetes. Depression interferes with self-care behaviors and significantly impacts glycemic control. Antidepressants are effective for the treatment of depression but can disrupt glycemic control and cause weight gain, making diabetes self-management challenging. Research has shown that vitamin D supplementation can improve depressive symptoms in healthy, obese individuals suggesting its use for amelioration of these symptoms in other groups. We recently completed a six month proof of concept study using a one group, pre-post test design to examine the effects of weekly vitamin D supplementation (50,000 IUs weekly) in women with type 2 diabetes who had significant depressive symptoms (a score > 16 on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Tool (CES-D) (NIH 5P60DK020595, pilot project). We found a significant decrease in depression symptoms, improvements in diabetes self- management, and a decrease in systolic blood pressure. Several small studies have shown that vitamin D supplementation may lower blood pressure by direct and indirect vascular effects. We now propose a randomized trial to determine the efficacy of vitamin D3 supplementation on depressive symptoms, self- management, and blood pressure in women with type 2 diabetes who have significant depressive symptoms (n=150). Using a stratified block randomization (strata based on depression symptom severity) women will be assigned to either weekly vitamin D3 supplementation (50,000 IUs) or a matching weekly placebo for a period of six months. Since guidelines recommend assessing vitamin D levels at three months upon initiating this dose, study measurements will be collected at baseline, three, and six months. The following outcomes will be measured: depressive symptoms, diabetes self-management (self-efficacy, diabetes distress, diabetes self- care behaviors), and systolic blood pressure. We hypothesize that women receiving vitamin D3 supplementation will report fewer depressive symptoms, increased diabetes self- management mediated by depression improvement, and have a lower systolic BP compared to those taking placebo. We will also explore a possible mechanistic effect of vitamin D supplementation on depression. Evidence indicates that in depression, pro-inflammatory biomarkers, notably cytokines and C-reactive protein (CRP), are elevated. Some of these inflammatory biomarkers alter the metabolic pathway of tryptophan by shunting it away from serotonin synthesis via stimulation of the enzyme indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO). Several studies (not depression studies) have reported that Vitamin D can decrease levels of inflammatory biomarkers. Thus we will explore whether vitamin D supplementation decreases inflammatory biomarkers (CRP, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor- ¿) providing evidence for a plausible mechanism of antidepressant activity. Vitamin D supplementation has minimal side effects and is low in cost. Thus, the potential for using this therapy is highly significant fr women with type 2 diabetes and other chronic populations who suffer from symptoms of depression which significantly impacts the self-management of their health.          ","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Can the Sunshine Vitamin Improve Mood and Self-Management in Women with Diabetes? Public Information: Vitamin D deficiency is a worldwide problem with research to suggest it may be beneficial to mental well being. Evidence indicates that insufficient levels of vitamin D are associated with depressive symptoms. Women with diabetes are burdened with these symptoms which can significantly affect their diabetes self- management. Women with diabetes also have insufficient levels of vitamin D. This study will determine whether providing vitamin D supplementation can improve mood and subsequently enhance diabetes self-management. If effective, this could be a low cost treatment for women with type 2 diabetes who are at greatest risk for depression and poor glycemic control.                    ",

Traditional CVD risk factors do not completely explain these risks, and therapies with established benefit in the general population have not consistently proven effective in CKD. Animal studies suggest that higher serum phosphate may be a causal risk factor for these outcomes in CKD patients. Similar findings are supported by observational data in humans. Leading international guidelines recommend lowering serum phosphate using binders and dietary phosphate restriction in CKD patients. However, we have recently conducted randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in CKD patients demonstrating that these approaches are minimally effective, difficult for patients adherence, and may cause harm. Novel approaches are needed, and we have identified the lipid drug niacin as a potential therapeutic agent for phosphate lowering. Animal studies demonstrate that niacin blocks intestinal phosphate absorption. Studies in ESRD patients, and our pilot studies in CKD patients, suggest that niacin may substantially lower phosphate levels by approximately 2 to 10 fold more than binders or phosphate restriction. In addition, preliminary data suggest that niacin may slow progression of CKD. Thus, by extension, niacin may ultimately improve fracture, CVD, and ESRD risk in CKD patients. Funded by the NHLBI, AIM-HIGH is a recently completed large RCT of niacin in patients with prevalent CVD, and 12% of AIM-HIGH patients had CKD at baseline. We propose an ancillary study in AIM-HIGH participants with CKD examining the randomized treatment effect of niacin on (1) serum phosphate levels, (2) other measures of mineral metabolism, and (3) change in kidney function over 3 years. This efficient design will provide substantial new insights to treatment of mineral bone disorder in CKD with minimal patient risk, and has the potential to rapidly change clinical practice for the 27 million persons with CKD in the US, and many more worldwide.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic kidney disease is common and strongly linked with risk of fractures, cardiovascular disease, and end stage renal disease.

Despite strong biological plausibility and supportive observational data, the independent and, especially, synergistic anti-neoplastic effects of calcium and vitamin D in humans are not clear. Proposed mechanisms have included protection of the colonic epithelium against bile acids, direct effects on the cell cycle, and modulation of growth factor signaling, inflammation, and immune function. Based on basic science and limited human evidence, we hypothesize that calcium and vitamin D supplementation decrease blood levels of biomarkers of inflammation and colonic permeability in humans. We will investigate this in an adjunct study to an ongoing multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2 x 2 factorial chemoprevention clinical trial (n = 2,259) of supplemental calcium (1,200 mg elemental calcium daily as calcium carbonate) and vitamin D3 (1,000 IU daily), alone and in combination vs. placebo over 3 - 5 years (the 'parent study').

A novel therapeutic target, mitochondrial dysfunction, has been implicated in multiple diseases, including heart failure. However, there currently is no specific treatment for mitochondrial dysfunction in human heart failure or any other disease. Mitochondria-based therapy development has been hampered both by limited understanding of how mitochondrial impairment causes cardiac dysfunction, and by a lack of interventions shown to improve mitochondrial function. Recently, we demonstrated in a murine model, that impaired mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation led to an increased myocardial NADH/NAD+ ratio and increased mitochondrial protein acetylation, without affecting mitochondrial ROS production or ATP synthesis. These changes rendered the heart susceptible to chronic stresses, which accelerated the development of heart failure. We observed a similar increase of NADH/NAD+ ratio and increase in protein acetylation in animal models of heart failure due to chronic pressure overload with no prior mitochondrial dysfunction. Supplying the NAD+ precursor, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), to these mice normalized the NADH/NAD+ ratio, prevented increased mitochondrial protein acetylation and improved cardiac function. Though NMN is not orally bioavailable, we and others have shown that oral supplementation with nicotinamide riboside (NR), the precursor from which NMN is produced, also decreases (normalizes) tissue NADH/NAD+ ratio and improves mitochondrial function in mouse models. These animal model results suggest a conceptually innovative mechanism linking mitochondrial dysfunction to the development and progression of heart failure that is distinct from the existing hypotheses of oxidative stress and energy starvation. Thus, we hypothesize that oral supplementation with NR will improve the NADH/NAD+ ratio caused by mitochondrial dysfunction during chronic stresses, and improve functional capacity and ventricular function in systolic heart failure. We therefore propose a first-in-human, safety and tolerability trial of the nutritional supplement, nicotinamide riboside (NR) in 30 participants wit clinically-stable, systolic heart failure. NR is a relative of niacin, but a closer relative of nicotinamide which, unlike niacin, does not induce flushing or pruritis and has no effect on lipid levels. NR does not induce insulin resistance or dysglycemia in mouse models. Thus, NR would potentially be cheap, safe, well-tolerated and readily available. The application is in response to  the program announcement of 'Nutrition and Diet in the Causation, Prevention, and Management of Heart Failure' as NR has recently been approved for human use as a health supplement. As NR has not been used therapeutically in heart failure patients, we will utilize the R21 mechanism to support a pilot study with the following aims: 1) to determine the safety and tolerability of NR in patients with clinically-stable, systolic heart failure (LVEF <40%); 2) to determine whether, at the doses employed, NR has measureable effects on leukocyte NAD+ level and NADH/NAD+ ratio; and 3) to explore the potential range of effects of NR supplementation on heart failure surrogate endpoints.          ","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this research project is to develop innovative approaches for heart failure care by translating the laboratory findings in mitochondrial biology and function. We will test a strategy of protecting the heart from mitochondrial dysfunction by increasing NAD+ level in patients with heart failure via dietary supplementation of nicotinamide riboside (NR). The proposed study will determine the safety and tolerability of NR in heart failure  patients.               ",

Obesity is a state of high adipose-tissue renin-angiotensin system (RAS) activity, hypoadiponectinemia, and vitamin D deficiency. These intertwined metabolic abnormalities contribute to increased cardiovascular risk in obesity. The applicant's prior data support the hypothesis that vitamin D therapy may be an effective strategy to lower adipose-tissue RAS activity and raise circulating adiponectin in obesity; these favorable metabolic profiles could reduce cardiovascular risk in obesity.  The applicant proposes to study 60 obese human subjects in a well-controlled physiologic experimental protocol that is designed to test whether the active vitamin D metabolite, calcitriol, can modulate adipose-tissue RAS activity and influence circulating adiponectin levels in obesity. The specific aims of this project are designed to test: 1) whether calcitriol interacts with the vitamin D receptor to reduce adipose-tissue renin expression in obesity; and 2) whether calcitriol therapy raises circulating adiponectin in obesity. Although each aim addresses a specific relevant metabolic question, both utilize the same study population and core study design to maximize efficiency and resources. Study subjects will be randomized to calcitriol therapy or placebo for two weeks. Aim 1 will evaluate adipose-tissue renin expression before and after intervention, and whether the effect of calcitriol is influenced by genetic variation at Fok1: a functional polymorphism of the vitamin D receptor gene. Aim 2 will assess circulating adiponectin before and after intervention.  The demonstration that vitamin D therapy modulates the expression of hormones that mediate vascular disease (the RAS and adiponectin) is crucial to the current medical debate surrounding vitamin D and its potentially therapeutic properties; it would strongly support the role of vitamin D supplementation in obesity. This is particularly relevant since obesity and vitamin D deficiency are epidemics that occur in tandem, and are the focus of large-scale NIH funded prospective randomized trials. In this regard, the applicant's results could serve as an important physiologic mechanism to explain the results of these concurrent trials; an issue of high relevance for the NIH and NHLBI. The applicant has a long track-record of success in academic research, and extensive experience conducting human physiology studies investigating vitamin D, the RAS, and adiponectin biology in obesity. The NIH has awarded him the NIH F32 (NRSA) and Loan Repayment Awards for his related projects. His research and mentoring environment are strongly suited to successfully complete the proposed research, and he has assembled an experienced team of senior investigators to enhance his training plan and support his future endeavor of becoming an independent investigator.","PROJECT NARRATIVE Obesity, excess adipose-tissue renin-angitoensin system (RAS) activity, and the deficiencies of vitamin D and adiponectin are all unfavorable metabolic profiles that aggregate in tandem, and are all associated with increased cardiovascular risk. The applicant's preliminary data support vitamin D therapy as a potential method to reduce adipose-tissue RAS activity and raise circulating adiponectin in obesity; thus, potentially reducing cardiovascular risk. This research plan proposes to conduct a prospective study to evaluate whether vitamin D therapy lowers adipose-tissue RAS activity and raises adiponectin in obese humans; this demonstration would be of major public health relevance, and in line with the missions of the NIH and NHLBI.",

We recently showed that daily oral treatment with low levels of quercetin decreases oxidative stress, inflammation and prevents progression of lung disease in mice which display typical features of chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) Our pilot studies also suggest that quercetin inhibits replication of rhinovirus, a major cause of COPD exacerbations. Finally, large epidemiological studies have suggested that a high- quercetin diet decreases the risk of COPD. Together, these data suggest that quercetin would be beneficial in the treatment of COPD. Nevertheless, key methodologic issues have not been resolved, including the dosage and frequency of supplementation, bioavailability, safety, dose-response relationship, or the appropriate biomarkers which reflect clinical outcomes in this disease. The overall goal of this application is to obtain the information necessary for large clinical trials in COPD. To accomplish this goal, we propose the following Specific Aims. 1. Determine if once-daily doses of quercetin are safe, acceptable and reach therapeutic concentrations in the plasma of patients with COPD. Using a quercetin formulation that has been 'generally recognized as safe' by the FDA (Quercegen Pharma, Sudbury, MA), we will test the hypotheses that: 1) dietary flavonoid intake can be accurately monitored by questionnaire; and 2) daily supplementation of quercetin increases plasma quercetin levels in COPD patients; and 3) quercetin can be administered to patients with COPD of varying severity without adverse side effects. 2. Determine the effect of quercetin on oxidative stress, lung inflammation and pulmonary function in patients with COPD. We hypothesize that: 1) oxidative and inflammatory biomarkers can be safely and accurately measured in the serum and sputum of patients with COPD; 2) daily treatment with quercetin will reduce plasma and sputum markers of oxidative stress and inflammation; 3) daily treatment with quercetin will improve pulmonary function in patients with COPD. Results from these studies will provide data on the quercetin dosage and biological endpoints needed to carry out large clinical trials examining the efficacy of quercetin in COPD.","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death in the U.S. Current treatment regimens for COPD are only partially effective, expensive, and often not adhered to by patients. In contrast to standard medications, natural products may have fewer side effects and be easy and inexpensive to use. Quercetin, a dietary chemical found in foods such as apples and onions is a natural product with anti- oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Our preliminary data and published studies suggest that quercetin may be useful in the treatment of COPD. The goal of this proposal is to perform a pilot study of quercetin in patients with COPD. The information gained from this study, including the correct dosage of medication and safety profile, will enable researchers to plan a large clinical trial of quercetin in the future.",

Once established, AF is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and current treatment options are associated with limited long term success rates and significant risks. In this application, we propose to evaluate the balance of benefits and risks of marine omega-3 fatty acid (840 mg eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] + docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) and vitamin D3 (2,000 IU/day cholecalciferol) on AF incidence in the setting of an NIH-funded large-scale clinical trial, the Vitamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL). VITAL is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2x2 factorial trial specifically designed to evaluate the efficacy of vitamin D3 and marine omega-3 fatty acid supplements in the primary prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease among 20,000 men (aged 50+ years) and women (aged 55+ years). Based upon data in cellular, animal, and human studies, both of the study agents have the potential to influence arrhythmic risk in general and AF risk specifically, both positively and negatively. However, definitive data from randomized trials are lacking, particularly with respect to primary prevention. In this application, we propose an ancillary study to ascertain and adjudicate AF outcomes for the primary aim of testing whether omega-3 fatty acid and/or vitamin D3 supplementation influences AF risk in an older population, where the incidence of AF is growing substantially. Case validation of incident AF will involve systematic ascertainment of physician diagnoses of AF on annual study questionnaires supplemented by CMS linkage followed by collection of detailed diagnostic information from outpatient and inpatient medical records. An endpoint committee composed of cardiologists will confirm incident AF events based on medical record review. As a secondary aim of the proposal, electrocardiograms will also be obtained at baseline and again after two years of treatment and follow-up among a sub-cohort of 1000 patients evaluated at the VITAL Clinical and Translational Science Center to assess whether and to what extent vitamin D3 or omega-3 supplementation might impact electrocardiographic parameters, which could serve as intermediate phenotypes for heart rhythm disorders. To address tertiary aims, detailed information on timing and mechanism of death will also be collected in the entire cohort to explore treatment effects on arrhythmic death, and EPA/DHA along with 25(OH) vitamin D levels will be measured in baseline blood samples in a nested case-cohort design to explore if baseline levels modify treatment effects on AF incidence. In summary, we propose a timely and cost-effective strategy that takes advantage of the enormous investment of resources and infrastructure in the VITAL trial to provide much needed data on the summation of benefits and risks of these agents on AF incidence as well as other arrhythmic endpoints. If either agent significantly lowers AF risk, then these agents would represent one of the first therapies proven effective for the primary prevention of this growing morbid disease.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained heart rhythm disturbance and accounts for approximately 15% of strokes and is associated with doubling of mortality. Once established, atrial fibrillation is difficult to treat; and therefore, research directed at prevention of atrial fibrillation is essential. Existing biologic and observational evidence supports potential health benefits of marine omega-3 fatty acids and Vitamin D which might prevent atrial fibrillation. However, due to lack of definitive data from large-scale clinical trials, it remains unclear whether AF can be delayed or prevented by use of these supplements. Findings from this proposed study conducted within a large clinical trial will clarify whether vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid supplementation reduces risk of developing AF and provide important data that will be applicable to public health and clinical guidelines for AF prevention.",

Gut-derived endotoxins normally penetrate the gut epithelium in only trace amounts due to tightly regulated intestinal barrier function. However, endotoxin leakiness is increased under pathological conditions, including alcohol abuse. The barrier function of intestinal epithelium Is provided in part by paracellular apical junction complexes, including tight and adherens junctions, and by a mucus layer.  In our initial systems biology approach to ALD, we found that intestinal trefoil factor (ITF) was by far the most altered (~50-fold down regulated) protein in the liver following chronic alcohol feeding in rats, and subsequent studies also showed marked down regulation of ITF mRNA and protein in the intestines of alcohol fed mice. ITF plays a critical role in the formation and stabilization of intestinal mucus barrier and enhancement of rapid intestinal repair 'restitution'. Formation and restitution ofthe barrier is also dependent on uninterrupted mucosal blood flow. Intestinal epithelial cells are positioned between an anaerobic lumen and a highly metabolic lamina propria forming a steep physiologic oxygen gradient. Increased hypoxia- inducible factor (HIF) signaling represents a major adaptive response to hypoxic stress by upregulating a variety of gene products, such as ITF and mucins, to form an integrated epithelial barrier. Our preliminary studies demonstrated that chronic alcohol administration decreases intestinal HIF-2a, ITF and tight junction protein expression resulting in increased endotoxemia and ultimately liver injury. Moreover, supplementation with a probiotic strain, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), increased intestinal HIF-2a and ITF expression, decreased endotoxemia and attenuated alcohol induced liver injury. We hypothesize that alcohol exposure causes detrimental metabolic changes favoring intestinal oxidative stress, inflammation, and alterations of HIF responsive signaling with decreased ITF, leading to intestinal barrier dysfunction, blood endotoxemia and ALD. We postulate that probiotic supplementation will attenuate alcohol-induced intestine and liver injury, in part by increasing HIF-mediated expression of mucus protective factors such as ITF in the intestine. We test our hypothesis with 4 specific aims using in vitro, animal, and human studies approaches. Our ultimate goal is the development of new therapies for ALD. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Alcohol overuse/abuse induces organ injury in multiple organs. This translational research project will examine the mechanisms of the beneficial effects of probiotics on the intestine and the liver in an experimental mouse model of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and in mild human alcoholic hepatitis (AH).","No data",

Anemia of any degree is recognized as a significant independent contributor to morbidity, mortality, and frailty in the elderly. Furthermore, race appears to be an important variable affecting anemia prevalence, with African-Americans displaying significantly higher rates of anemia than whites. As the number of elderly individuals is expected to reach unprecedented levels in the 21st century, anemia represents an emerging global health problem negatively impacting quality of life in the elderly population and requiring ever increasing allocation of health care resources. The pathogenesis of anemia in the elderly remains poorly studied and, as a consequence, there is a lack of proven preventive therapies. We recently showed that vitamin D deficiency is independently associated with a higher prevalence of anemia in the elderly, particularly among those with anemia of inflammation. We will take advantage of the VITAL study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial analyzing the role of vitamin D3 and marine omega-3 fatty acid (ω-3 FA) supplements in the primary prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease among 20,000 US men and women aged > 60 and > 65 years, respectively, to test the hypothesis that these interventions will ameliorate the development of anemia in the elderly. In addition, using a sub-sample of the VITAL cohort, we will investigate whether vitamin D and/or ω-3 FA influence erythropoiesis via hepcidin- and/or erythropoietin (EPO)-dependent pathways. We aim to determine whether vitamin D and/or w-3 FA supplements reduce the incidence of diagnosed anemia through the use of medical record review and supplementary questionnaires completed by participants' physicians. In our sub-study, fresh samples will be collected pre- and post-intervention from 900 subjects who will be evaluated at the Boston Clinical and Translational Science Center (CTSC). Using serial measurements of hemoglobin (HgB), red blood cell (RBC) indices, hepcidin, and erythropoietin, we will determine whether vitamin D and/or w-3 FA moderate inflammation-mediated effects on Hgb levels and erythropoietic pathways. The research infrastructure of the parent VITAL trial will provide a unique and cost-effective framework that will allow us to examine the potential benefits of vitamin D and/or w-3 FA supplementation in decreasing anemia in an elderly population. In order to complete baseline (pre-randomization) assessments of Hgb and erythropoietic pathways on fresh samples that will be collected from participants at the Boston CTSC site, it is critically important that this proposl begin in parallel to the 1-year enrollment period for the parent VITAL trial (1U01CA138962), scheduled to begin November 2011.","Vitamin D and omega-3s appear to have favorable effects on chronic inflammation, but their impact on the risk and pathogenesis of anemia, which is often inflammation-related, remains largely unknown.

Endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide or LPS) is a component of coarse and fine mode PM, bioaerosols, tobacco and biomass smoke. Ozone (O3) is the most commonly encountered ambient air pollutant in the US. Epidemiological studies have shown that both LPS and O3 are important asthma triggers. In challenge studies of AAs, we have shown that LPS and O3 induces influx of neutrophils (PMNs) and eosinophils in AAs as well as augmenting response to inhaled allergens. O3 is also an oxidant, and both O3 and LPS increase radical production by airway cells, with both nutritional and genetically defined antioxidant deficiencies (such as the GSTM1 null genotype) being associated with increased risk for pollutant-induced asthma exacerbation. In challenge studies, we have reported that LPS and O3 PMN responses are increased in GSTM1 null volunteers. Gamma tocopherol has known antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions. We have shown that γT prevents allergen, O3 and LPS-induced respiratory tract inflammation in rodents. Our phase I human studies with γT-mT established a dose which maintains γT and its anti-inflammatory metabolites, decreases monocyte responses to LPS and IgE-mediated basophil response to allergen. Data from our initial double-blinded, placebo controlled phase IIa study in healthy volunteers demonstrates that γT-mT inhibits LPS-induced granulocyte influx.

Despite current available medical and surgical therapies, patients with PAD continue to be at an unacceptably high risk for cardiovascular events and death. Accordingly, interventions to improve morbidity and mortality are critical. Emerging research demonstrates the inter-related effects of inflammation, vascular function and outcomes in PAD. Lifestyle modifications, including exercise and diet, may potentially improve symptoms, as well as modulate factors that influence disease progression and long-term outcomes in these patients. Fish oil has long been recognized to have beneficial effects on cardiovascular health, despite recent controversy. Recent studies have emerged on the role of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) present in fish oil in the termination of inflammation. This role offers new perspectives on the benefits of fish oil consumption. Furthermore, our group recently demonstrated that the omega-3 index, a measure of n-3 PUFA content in red blood cells, is inversely related to inflammation in patients with PAD, and others have shown that n-3 PUFA supplementation can improve vascular function. Hence, overall evidence suggests that fish oil could play a key role in the regulation of inflammatory processes and vascular dysfunction that characterize PAD. My long-term goal is to increase our understanding of how nutritional and lifestyle modifications can reduce the burden of disease in PAD. Accordingly, my goal with the present study is to determine if high-dose n-3 PUFA oral supplementation will improve systemic inflammation, vascular function, and the walking ability of patients with PAD. This will be evaluated using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 70 patients aged e 50 with PAD receiving 4.4 g/day of n-3 PUFA for 3 months. Specific measurements will include markers of both inflammation and termination of inflammation, measures of vascular function, and a walking test.  The study proposed here has the potential to provide important new insights on the role of nutritional interventions in PAD, as well as to improve our understanding of the effects of fish oil supplementation in cardiovascular diseases. It will support the goal of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute of reducing the burden of heart, lung, and blood diseases worldwide.

A recent Institute of Medicine Report notes that air pollution exposure may be a  significant cause of prematurity, but most published studies are based on population birth registries and lack  the individual, clinical data needed to elucidate possible biological mechanisms mediating these  epidemiological associations. This proposed work presents a unique opportunity to study those mechanisms  in a new cohort of 800 pregnant women residing in diverse regions of Mexico City, a mega-city with high air  pollution levels. We will advance understanding of prematurity by investigating how air pollution and  inflammation may act together to influence the outcome of pregnancy, and whether certain periods of gestation  represent critical time windows and opportunities for preventive interventions, both clinical and environmental.  We will obtain biomarkers relevant to inflammation and preterm delivery (IL-1ß, IL-1rα, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α)  in cervico-vaginal exudate provided by participants monthly during their pregnancies, along with information on  infections, health history, clinical characteristics, diet and time-activity patterns. We will use state-of-the-art  exposure assessment techniques to evaluate spatial and temporal variability in air pollution exposure using  data from the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA) air quality monitoring network (PM2.5, PM10, ozone,  nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide), matched to locations of participants' homes. At birth, DNA  samples from mother and infant will be used to type three genetic cytokine polymorphisms (TNF-α, IL-1ß, IL-  1rα) that have been associated with enhanced risk of preterm birth. We will evaluate whether ambient pollution  is associated with preterm birth, controlling for other risk factors; whether they are associated with cytokines  during pregnancy, and which time windows are most relevant. We will examine effect modification by intake of  antioxidant vitamins (E and C) and cytokine polymorphisms. Finally, we will complement this epidemiological  study with a parallel toxicology in-vitro study which will involve collecting and characterizing air pollution  particle samples (PM10 and PM2.5) on a monthly basis from five zones in MCMA and exposing a monocytic cell  line (J774A.1) to evaluate expression of the same cytokines. Any coherence between the human and in vitro  evidence for a mechanistic association between pollution and these mediating molecules will guide future  studies. This multi-disciplinary, global health collaboration will evaluate potential environmental and clinical  determinants of preterm delivery, with the goal of developing unique knowledge with far-reaching prevention  implications.","Project Narrative  Relevance to public health: This research investigates how air pollution influences the risk for preterm  birth, with a focus on elucidating the potential role for inflammatory mechanisms. The goal is to develop  knowledge to support 1) policy-makers who set and enforce health-protective air pollution standards; 2)  scientists involved in multi-disciplinary studies to understand environmental contributions to infant health,  and 3) clinicians interested in prevention of preterm birth.",

In 2011, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) concluded that while scientific evidence supports a role of vitamin D for bone health, compelling evidence was lacking for non-bone health outcomes such as neuromuscular function due to the paucity of randomized trials. The IOM committee also concluded that 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D)  concentrations e20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) were sufficient for bone and overall health. This conclusion has sparked  controversy as a large volume of observational research has found that 25(OH)D concentrations e30 ng/mL  (75 nmol/L) are beneficial for non-bone health outcomes. The resolution of this controversy is important since  almost 20 million older adults (or one-half of the older U.S. adult population) have 25(OH)D concentrations  between 20 and 30 ng/mL. There is growing evidence that vitamin D's effect on reducing falls is mediated by  improvements in neuromuscular function. Observational studies show associations between 25(OH)D  concentrations and muscle strength and physical performance measures associated with fall risk (e.g., gait,  balance). Results from previous vitamin D supplementation trials on changes in muscle strength and physical  performance have been equivocal, however. Moreover, the underlying mechanisms for vitamin D's effect on  neuromuscular function are lacking. We propose to: 1) determine whether increasing 25(OH)D concentrations  to e30 ng/mL will improve neuromuscular function in older adults with initial 25(OH)D concentrations of 20-<30  ng/mL~ and 2) examine potential underlying mechanisms by which vitamin D supplementation may enhance  muscle physiology and performance. To achieve these goals we will conduct a 12-month, double-blind  randomized placebo controlled trial in 200 older (70-89 yrs) men and women with 25(OH)D concentrations of  20-<30 ng/mL to determine the effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on 1) change in neuromuscular functions  that are established risk-factors for falls in older adults (Aim 1)~ and 2) changes in the underlying physiological  mechanisms over 4 months in a subset of 40 randomly selected participants (Aim 2).

In order to meet these goals we are proposing a  gold standard  investigation with a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.  Briefly, we will enroll 2300 HIV-infected pregnant women at 12-27 weeks gestation who are enrolled in the Management and Development for Health (MDH) President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) program in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania. HIV-infected mothers who consent for enrollment in the trial will be randomized to receive an oral supplement regimen of one of two groups: (a) vitamin D3 oral supplements containing 3,000 IU taken daily until 12 months post-partum or (b) placebo supplements taken daily until 12 months post- partum. HIV-infected women and children will be followed at regular study visits and during labor and delivery to assess the primary trial endpoints (a) maternal HIV progression, (b) small- for-gestational age infants, and (c) child stunting at 1 year of age. Secondarily, we will also assess the effect of vitamin D3 on (i) maternal CD4 T-cell reconstitution, (ii) preterm birth, (iii) low birth weight (<2500 g), (iv) mother to child transmision of HIV, and (v) maternal and child parathyroid hormone levels (PTH). Evidence from this randomized trial is urgently needed since ART coverage is rapidly expanding globally for HIV-infected women, particularly due to expansion of Option B+, and treatment programs are in need of interventions to prolong and improve the quality of life for HIV-infected pregnant women and their children.

Emerging biologic and epidemiologic data suggest antimicrobial benefits from vitamin D supplements, and possibly marine omega-3 fatty acids (I-3 FA). However, large, long-term prevention trials with adequate dosing in general populations are not available. The IOM recently called for more research on vitamin D. We propose to take advantage of a large NIH-funded study - the VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) - to examine the short- and long-term effects of vitamin D and I-3 FA supplements on infection. We also will examine the effect of vitamin D on plasma levels of human cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide (hCAP18), a potential mechanism for the hypothesized antimicrobial benefits of vitamin D. VITAL is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2x2 factorial trial with 20,000 participants (men age e60y; women e65y). Starting in April 2011 and continuing through July 2012, subjects will be enrolled in a 3-month run-in, during which they will receive placebos. At the end of the run-in, those who remain willing and eligible, and who report having taken at least two-thirds of pills, will be randomly assigned to one of four groups for 5 years: vitamin D3 (2000 IU/d) and fish oil (EPA+DHA, 1 g/d); vitamin D3 and fish oil placebo; placebo vitamin D3 and fish oil; and placebo vitamin D3 and placebo fish oil. At 1-year intervals, participants will receive a new supply of pills and a follow-up questionnaire on compliance, possible side effects, and incidence of endpoints. Primary aims of this ancillary study will address upper respiratory infections (URIs) and require the timely creation of a subcohort (10% sample, n=2,000) in early 2012. This URI subcohort will receive special mailings in Feb/Mar 2012 (baseline), Oct/Nov 2012, and Feb/Mar 2013 (same season, 1 year later). The latter mailings will collect details about recent URIs (e.g., severity, duration of illness, treatments). We will collect baseline and 1-year follow-up blood specimens to test for changes in 25(OH)D, I-3, and hCAP18 levels. These data will answer several questions, including whether vitamin D increases hCAP18 levels, and whether this change mediates the hypothesized reduction in URIs. Secondary aims will examine several other types of infections (pneumonia & influenza, urinary tract infections, skin, any antimicrobial-treated infection, infection-related hospitalizations/sepsis), which we will confirm by CMS linkage. In a subset of 250 cases of each outcome, we will further confirm endpoints by supplemental questionnaire. Long-term follow-up will allow us to address the emerging concern that an early beneficial effect could be followed by a weakening or even reversal of benefit with prolonged supplementation. The current study presents a highly efficient and innovative strategy to evaluate vitamin D and I-3 FA supplementation for short- and long-term prevention of infectious diseases, and to test hCAP18 as a potential mechanism. The findings may have direct clinical and public health impact for the prevention of infections in older adults.","The purported health benefits of vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids are receiving increasing attention in the medical literature and popular press. However, definitive data on the health benefits and risks of these agents are lacking. Findings from this large clinical trial will clarify the role of vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid supplements in the prevention of respiratory infections and other major infectious diseases in men and women.",

But during this life-cycle stage children living in poverty are often vulnerable to negative influences including malnutrition, illnesses, an un-stimulating environments, possibly preventing them from reaching their full potential and perpetuating poverty across generations. Small-scale studies have demonstrated that offering stimulation and nutrition to young children can have positive effects on short and long-term outcomes, such as cognition, self-esteem, depression and other important measures. However it has not yet been demonstrated that these interventions can be scaled-up to form the basis of sustainable and effective policy towards child development. The project will introduce a stimulation program, coupled with micronutrient supplementation, to improve interactions between mothers and their young children with the aim of achieving better child outcomes. The program will follow a systematic weekly curriculum based on the natural developmental stages of the child. It will be implemented in rural communities of Odisha in India, an area where poverty and malnutrition are prevalent. It will be delivered by women from within the communities, which will have been trained for this purpose, in the following forms: (i) weekly individual home visits to the child and its main caregiver/mother, or (ii) in a suitably modified way, within the context of weekly main caregiver/mother and child group meetings. The intervention will be accompanied by an evaluation based on a randomized control trial with five variants including a control group. Data will be collected on child developmental outcomes and detailed maternal- and household-level data before the start, halfway through and at the end of the intervention. Having local women deliver the intervention is key to designing low-cost and sustainable policies. The formation of groups could further reduce costs and enhance the dissemination of good child rearing practices. The aim is to test for effectiveness and to understand the pathways through which these interventions achieve their outcomes. As such the project relates directly to the NIH mission of applying knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce the burdens of illness. The research will be disseminated through presentations at academic conferences, to policy makers and stakeholders at specially designed meetings and will form the basis for submission to top peer-reviewed Journals such as the Lancet and the American Economic Review. Results will be posted on a dedicated website.          ","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: By identifying cost-effective and scalable early-years interventions, our research has the potential to revolutionize early childhood development (ECD) policies and contribute to breaking the intergenerational cycle of poverty. If the interventions we  propose to test prove to be successful, our findings can form a blueprint for ECD strategies that will be applicable in poor communities, based on local resources and empowerment and capable of changing the developmental trajectories of children in a substantive way.

We propose to take advantage of a disorder, neural tube defects (NTDs), in which the existing mouse models closely parallel the human disease and in which several lines of evidence indicate a strong influence in both mouse and man of epigenetic modifications regulating disease expression. We will combine proof of principle studies in the mouse with investigations of human NTD cohorts to examine the relationship between DNA/chromatin methylation and the expressivity of NTDs in genetically susceptible individuals.  The study of epigenetic events contributing to NTDs has multiple distinct advantages over epigenomic investigation of other human diseases, as more than 200 genes are implicated in NTDs by human or animal studies. These provide critical clues to molecular pathways important for normal neurulation. Supporting the existing clinical data, we discovered several NTD-prone mouse mutant lines in which NTD occurrence is sensitive to folic acid supplementation. Folate metabolism is the source of al S-adenosyl methoinine (SAM), which is the primary methyl donor for methylating nucleic acids, proteins and lipids. Providing methyl donors is thought to be a major route through which folate supplementation exerts its beneficial effects on neurulation. We will use cutting edge and emerging technologies applied to mouse and human patient material to interrogate genome wide methylation and chromatin remodeling interactions, correlated with individual genotype, to examine epigenetic effects on the transcriptome and on phenotypic outcome.  This proposal tests the hypothesis that epigenetic modifications in DNA and chromatin in the setting of prenatal supplementation that modulates DNA and chromatin methylation will impact a recognizable pattern of gene expression to either favor or impair neurulation in a manner that can be predicted based on individual genotype. Moreover, we hypothesize that certain patterns will be evident not only in the developing neural tube but also in the peripheral blood and so will be useful in evaluating risk and optimal NTD prevention in a clinical setting. We predict that some DNA and chromatin methylation signatures acquired in utero wil persist postnatally, regardless of whether supplementation continues after birth.

Dr. Sen previously identified the importance of oxidative stress in the causative pathway of intergenerational obesity in an animal model, and her pilot data shows that oxidative stress is markedly increased, and anti-oxidant defenses markedly depleted, in obese pregnant women. This trial is a logical extension of this previous work. Her central hypothesis is that obese pregnancy is characterized by an oxidant/anti-oxidant imbalance, which increases inflammation and adversely impacts maternal health and neonatal outcome. Restoring oxidant/anti-oxidant balance with a body mass index-based prenatal micronutrient supplement will decrease oxidative stress and inflammation and improve both maternal and neonatal outcomes in obese pregnancy. This hypothesis will be tested in a randomized controlled trial in obese pregnant women. Given its overwhelming current and future impact, innovative approaches to diminish the effect of maternal obesity on future generations are of paramount public health importance.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: One out of three pregnant women is obese, predisposing the next generation to obesity and metabolic dysregulation. Interventions to ameliorate the adverse effects of obese pregnancy are of paramount importance in arresting the propagation of this vicious cycle. Since oxidant/antioxidant balance appears to play a critical role in transgenerational obesity, a BMI-based antioxidant vitamin supplement will be given to obese mothers during pregnancy and biochemical and clinical outcomes will be followed, making the proposed study a safe and inexpensive approach to significantly impact a condition that the WHO has stated is the most important public health problem facing the world today.",
"5","R01","AR063910-03","DBP and the bioavailability and function of vitamin D","","31-May-2016","Adams, John S; HEWISON, Martin ","UNITED STATES","401332","2015","AR","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the last ten years there has been a remarkable renaissance in vitamin D research. Two key concepts have underpinned this renewed interest in the health benefits of vitamin D. First is the continuing debate on the worldwide prevalence of vitamin D-insufficiency, and how optimal vitamin D status can be safely achieved through conventional exposure to sunlight and dietary intake. Second is the potential for vitamin D to promote health benefits beyond its classical effects on the skeleton. Following a recent data review, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) has issued statements aimed at addressing some of the key questions concerning our new perspective on vitamin D and human health. The Recommended Dietary Allowance of vitamin D for all age groups was elevated based on bone responses to vitamin D. However, the IOM report also recognized the need for further research to better define 'non-classical' health benefits of vitamin D. The long-term impact of these recommendations is crucially dependent on one question - how does one define vitamin D-sufficiency and -insufficiency? The proposed project describes a new paradigm for quantifying optimal vitamin D and its relation to human health. The overall aim is to demonstrate that vitamin D activity is not simply defined by total serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25D) but instead depends on the bioavailability of this metabolite to target cells and its subsequent conversion to active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D) via the enzyme 1�-hydroxylase (CYP27B1). The proposal hypothesizes that the ability of 25D to access target cells is influenced by its association with the serum vitamin D binding protein (DBP), with 'free' rather than 'DBP-bound' 25D being the bioactive form of this metabolite. The overall objective of the proposal will be to investigate the impact of DBP on the bioactivity of 25D using both mouse and human models. Studies using transgenic, knockout, and humanized mice will investigate how variations in the concentration and vitamin D metabolite binding affinity of DBP affect the response of these mice to 25D and 1,25D under conditions of vitamin D-sufficiency and -deficiency. Data from these experiments will then be related to studies in humans, where DBP concentration and binding affinity are strongly influenced by genetic variations in the DBP gene. Human studies will incorporate analysis of DBP and free 25D/1,25D in a large patient cohort with multiple measures of vitamin D function, but will also involve a pilot supplementation study utilizing parental vitamin D or 25D. These analyses will employ a new mathematical algorithm for determining serum free 25D and 1,25D and will use novel assay technology to physically measure serum levels of free 25D. This model not only puts forward a new paradigm for defining optimal vitamin D status but also aims to highlight a more 'personalized' perspective on vitamin D health that will incorporate both classical and non-classical actions of vitamin D.   .","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vitamin D has been linked to a wide range of human health benefits, but the optimal level of vitamin D required for these effects is far from clear. We have hypothesized that rather than simply measuring total serum concentrations of vitamin D, it is more biologically and clinically relevant to determine free or bioactive levels of serum vitamin D metabolites. To demonstrate this, the proposed project will utilize in vivo mouse and human models in which free serum vitamin D is altered as a consequence of variable expression of the serum vitamin D binding protein, with the overall aim of the project being to present an entirely new paradigm for defining optimal vitamin D status in humans. .",

Program Summary/Abstract: Botanical Core  The Botanical Core of the Botanical Dietary Supplement Research Center facilitates the work of the three  primary Research Projects, the Integrative Biology Core (IBC) as well as Pilot Research and Training  Programs. The complex nature of botanicals dictates that the genetic makeup of the plant, the growing  conditions and the method of botanical preparation all have significant effects on the overall composition of and  biological effect of the botanical product. Moreover, the effect of botanicals to convey a biological response,  such as enhancing basic resiliency, is likely the result of the complex interactions of multiple bioactive  compounds. To address this complexity, the Botanical Core uses state-of-the-art phytochemical discovery,  characterization, standardization and production approaches and modern greenhouse facilities to perform its  mission which include the following specific aims:  Aim 1. The Botanical Core prepares and provides specific botanical materials for the Center's research  projects (Artemisia sp, Trigonella foenum gracecum [fenugreek], Moringa oleifera Lam., and Momordica  charantia [bitter melon]), pre-clinical, clinical and pilot studies, activity-guided isolation of bioactives and  characterization of their interactions, analytical and structural chemistry support for the research activities,  quality control and botanical authentication when necessary.  Aim 2. The Botanical Core collaborates with each project, pilot projects and the IBC to examine the  bioaccessibility and bioavailability of botanical bioactives. Bioavailability and pharmacokinetic parameters will  be measured using currently utilized analytical techniques.  Aim 3. The Botanical Core assists in design and conduct of pilot studies and in the education and training of  new investigators for biobotanical research, providing specific recommendations and/or evaluations of the  quality and sourcing of botanical materials to be used for proposed studies.

We will perform a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial of 128 patients comparing the effects of calcitriol versus cholecalciferol in stage IIIB and stage IV CKD patients with vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency on conduit artery endothelium- dependent dilation (EDD) measured by brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD). The primary outcome is the difference between the calcitriol and cholecalciferol groups in 6 month FMD in response to treatment. Secondary aims are focused to explore whether vitamin D improves vascular endothelial function through decreases in inflammation by determining the effects of calcitriol versus cholecalciferol on plasma concentrations of CRP, IL-6 and endothelial cell expression of NF-κB. Subjects will have these measurements performed at baseline and at 6 months and will have calcium and phosphorus drawn monthly to assess safety. This study will answer the important clinical question of whether nutritional (i.e., cholecalciferol) or active (i.e., calcitriol) vitamin D supplementation improves vascular endothelial function in moderate to severe CKD in a direct head to head comparison.

This research proposal will focus on another epidemic in kidney disease patients, vitamin D deficiency, which may be a contributing cause to their increased vascular damage and cardiovascular disease. Vitamin D deficiency has been linked with bone disease as well as diabetes, hypertension, myocardial infarctions, heart failure and arterial dysfunction. This proposal will examine if vitamin D supplementation (nutritional or active vitamin D) improves arterial function in patients with moderate to severe kidney disease.

While much research has focused on the dysmorphological and neurological features of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), there is a critical gap in the literature with regard to our understanding of the nutritional and immunological mechanisms whereby postnatal growth and performance deficits in children affected by alcohol are initiated and subsequently persist throughout childhood, and therefore might be targets for postnatal intervention. Based on preliminary data from an ongoing clinical trial in Ukraine, conducted in a sample of moderate to heavy alcohol-consuming pregnant women, a multimicronutrient supplementation (multiple-vitamin-mineral supplement with or without additional choline) given during pregnancy is associated with a marked reduction of alcohol-related growth and neurocognitive deficits in infants at 6 and 12 months of age. These promising initial findings could have worldwide public health impact if demonstrated to persist. The primary goal of the current application is to investigate the persistence of the beneficial effects of multimicronutrient supplementation on growth and development through preschool age in an established longitudinal sample of children in Ukraine. Secondary goals of this application are to evaluate postnatal factors, including nutritional status of the child and marker of immune function and oxidative stress, that may contribute to persistent deficits among alcohol-exposed children in the context of prenatal nutritional factors. The proposed study will build on the strengths of an established Ukrainian cohort of well- characterized children, now between 2 and 5 years of age: a) to assess the impact of known prenatal alcohol exposure, with or without a past prenatal nutritional intervention, on the child's growth and neurobehavioral function through 5 years of age, and b) to determine the antecedents of an alcohol-affected child's postnatal nutritional and immunologic status and the contribution of this postnatal environment to persistent neurobehavioral and growth deficits.","Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are thought to be the most common developmental disabilities worldwide. The goal of this study is to investigate the beneficial effects of prenatal vitamin supplements on growth and development of alcohol-exposed children through preschool age, and to examine the role of childhood nutrition in the growth and learning deficits seen in FASD.

Anemia which does not respond to treatment with erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA) is common in clinical practice. Much evidence points to adverse health effects associated with escalation of ESA therapy in CKD patients with treatment resistant anemia. However, little progress has been made toward identifying other mechanisms which contribute to anemia in CKD in order to identify safe and effective adjunctive treatments. Hepcidin, an anti-microbial peptide produced by the liver, whose production is stimulated by inflammation, interferes with the utilization of iron stores for erythropoiesis. The specific contribution of hepcidin to the development of anemia in children with CKD has not been explored in a prospective manner. In addition, emerging evidence suggests that 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25D) deficiency is a novel risk factor for anemia in CKD, which may be due to 25D-dependent immunomodulation. Interruption of the inflammatory stimuli which increase hepcidin production could make the management of CKD-associated anemia with iron supplementation and ESAs more effective. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to define the contribution of hepcidin mediated mechanisms to the anemia of early CKD, and to understand whether hepcidin production may be modified by a therapeutic intervention. The Specific Aims of this project are to (1) define how elevated serum levels of hepcidin are associated with hemoglobin and ESA hypo-responsiveness within the established NIH funded Chronic Kidney Disease in Children (CKiD) prospective cohort study, and (2) to evaluate the effects of ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) supplementation on serum levels of hepcidin, hemoglobin, and ESA dose in a prospective interventional trial in children with pre-dialysis CKD. Our central hypothesis is that in mild to moderate CKD, elevated serum hepcidin is associated with anemia (as defined by low hemoglobin). Furthermore, we hypothesize that in the setting of CKD, supplementation with ergocalciferol will be associated with a decrease in serum hepcidin and increase in hemoglobin. Our hypotheses have been formulated on the basis of an extensive review of the literature on vitamin D, hepcidin and anemia, and our own preliminary data produced by measuring serum hepcidin values in 124 children enrolled in CKiD, in whom higher hepdidin levels are associated with anemia, and preliminary study of normal children showing low 25D levels associated with anemia. The rationale for the combination of observational and interventional approaches proposed is to accelerate our understanding of the biologic mechanisms contributing to the anemia of CKD and simultaneously to develop new and innovative interventions to treat this common co-morbidity in childhood CKD.","Anemia affects more than half of the over 10 million Americans with chronic kidney disease (CKD), and is associated with poor health outcomes including heart disease and death. Anemia in CKD is often resistant to current treatments, suggesting that there may be other causes of anemia in CKD that have yet to be identified. Definition of the relative contributions of specific pathways to anemia in CKD will identify future treatments for this anemia, with the long term goal of improving quality of life, and decreasing both overall illness and the cost of anemia treatment in the CKD population.",

Proposed mechanisms have included protection of the colonic epithelium against bile acids, direct effects on the cell cycle, modulation of growth factors signaling, inflammation, and immune function. Based on basic science and limited human evidence, we propose to test a novel hypothesis that calcium and vitamin D supplementation strengthens the gut mucosal barrier as indicated by modulation of cell cycle, cell adhesion, receptors responsive to bacterial components, and markers of intestinal inflammation in humans. We also hypothesize that these changes in the colon will be accompanied by decreases in circulating levels of biomarkers of colonic hyperpermeability and pro-inflammatory cytokines. We will investigate this in an adjunct study to an ongoing multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2 x 2 factorial chemoprevention clinical trial (n = 2,259) of supplemental calcium (1,200 mg elemental calcium daily as calcium carbonate) and vitamin D3 (1,000 IU daily), alone and in combination vs. placebo over 3 - 5 years (the 'parent study'). A sub-set of participants (n = 112) with 'non-prep' biopsies of normal-appearing rectal mucosa taken at baseline and 1-year follow-up sigmoidoscopies is selected for this adjunct study. The primary aims of the proposed study are to 1) obtain preliminary data on the separate and joint effects of calcium and vitamin D3 supplementation on biomarkers of gut barrier function (Ki-67/MIB-1, caspase-3, TLR4, TLR5, ZO-1, claudin-1, occludin, mucin-17, E-cadherin, and beta-catenin) and inflammation (NFkappaB and TNFalpha) in biopsies of normal-appearing rectal mucosa, and 2) investigate whether the findings for the tissue-specific biomarkers are correlated with circulating biomarkers of gut barrier function (specific IgG and IgA to lipopolysaccharide [LPS] and flagellin, LPS binding protein [LBP], and intestinal fatty acid binding protein [I-FABP]) and inflammation (GM-CSF, IFNgamma, IL-6, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-8, IL- 10, IL-12p70, and TNFalpha). The proposed scope of work is limited to laboratory and statistical analyses using biological samples and questionnaire data from the 'parent study'. This adjunct study offers a unique, cost-effective opportunity in a large, ongoing trial in humans to explore a novel hypothesis that calcium and vitamin D beneficially modulate gut barrier function, and to elucidate the combined effects of calcium and vitamin D on biomarkers of gut barrier function and inflammation. Understanding the role of vitamin D and calcium in gut barrier function is of great importance, not only to colorectal neoplasm chemoprevention, but also to the prevention of multiple pathological conditions of the gastrointestinal tract.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will test in humans at increased risk for colorectal cancer whether calcium and vitamin D can strengthen colorectal barriers against bacteria and reduce inflammation, which could lead to lower risk for colorectal tumors. To do this we will use blood and rectal biopsy samples and data from a large clinical trial of supplemental vitamin D and calcium in persons who have had pre-cancerous colon polyps. If our ideas are correct, it would be like proving that blood cholesterol and pressure can be treated with simple dietary changes and lead to preventing heart disease.",

Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) has a high morbidity and mortality. In VA Cooperative Studies in which liver biopsies were performed, only 35% of patients with AH and underlying cirrhosis, and 60% of those with AH alone (no cirrhosis) were alive at the end of four years, with most deaths occurring early in the study. There is no FDA-approved therapy for any stage of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). The most widely-used (off-label) drug therapies for AH are glucocorticoids and pentoxifylline. Both agents have anti-inflammatory activities and downregulate proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Unfortunately, an important subset of AH patients treated with glucocorticoids have 'steroid resistance', and some patients have contraindications to steroid therapy. Studies on pentoxifylline in AH are limited, and efficacy appears highest in preventing/treating the hepatorenal syndrome. Thus, new therapies as well as a better understanding of mechanisms/biomarkers for severity of disease and response to therapy are necessary. Our research team has been a leader in defining mechanisms of alcohol-induced liver injury using in vitro and animal models of ALD, and in translating basic findings into the clinical setting. Our group is the first to describe dysregulated cytokine metabolism in AH. We have a long-standing interest in mechanisms of inflammation and liver injury. We also have extensive experience in the gut-liver axis and AH, as well as in the development of novel therapies for AH. Building on the above translational research strengths of our program which focus on the gut-liver axis and inflammation in ALD, we propose three highly translational Specific Aims, which all relate to and utilize samples from our proposed UO1 clinical trial. Aim 1 will evaluate novel mechanisms for alcohol-induced alterations in gut integriy leading to endotoxemia and AH. We will study the therapeutic efficacy of both live probiotics and probiotic supernatants. Aim 2 will study the role of specific PDE4 inhibition in AH using animal models and our AH clinical patient population. There are recent data in the pulmonary literature showing that specific PDE4 inhibitors are effective in steroid resistant patients which may translate to AH. Lastly, Aim 3 evaluates mechanisms for steroid resistance using both specimens from patients in our clinical trial and in vitro data. All three of our specific aims utiize specimens obtained from our U01 clinical trial, and our protocol interacts with the two other translational protocols in our U01 consortium. Our goal is not only to better understand mechanisms for AH, but also to develop new therapies (including those already available for other diseases) for AH, either immediately transforming clinical practice or providing novel therapies for our clinical trial consortium.","This is a translational application portion of an overall UO1 application.

Despite over 40 years of research on AH, there is still no FDA approved treatment for this disease. The most commonly used off-label drugs for AH are corticosteroids and pentoxifylline. Unfortunately, even patients with AH treated with corticosteroids have a 6 month mortality of 40%. These poor clinical outcomes are due, in large part, to an incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of alcohol-mediated liver injury. Therefore, there is an urgent need for effective new therapies for this pernicious disease. This multicenter study will be a collaborative effort of four medical centers (Cleveland Clinic, University of Louisville, UT Southwestern, and University of Massachusetts) with its ultimate goal of transforming the clinical treatment of AH by rapidly translating novel and innovative basic science discoveries into clinical practice. In the first 2.5 years of the grant, two clinical trials will test the hypohesis that disruption of the normal gut-barrier function, over-activation of the inflammatory cascade, and innate immune activation are the primary elements of the complex pathogenesis of AH. In patients with severe AH, the first trial will compare a novel drug combination of anakinra (an inhibitor of IL-1 activity), pentoxifylline (a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that suppresses the inflammatory cytokine cascade), and zinc (which improves gut-barrier function) with the current standard of care therapy of treatment with corticosteroids. The second trial will compare probiotics (to improve gut-barrier function) to placebo in patients with moderate AH. The primary outcomes of both clinical trials will be 6 month mortality. Both trials will also supply specimens o the translational/basic science components of this UO1 consortium to identify novel biomarkers and altered pharmacogenetics that predict disease severity and response to pharmacologic therapy as well as to identify unique drug targets for novel treatments for AH. These new discoveries will then be translated rapidly to clinical testing in the last 2.5 years of the grant.A biorepository of the collected clinical data and patient samples will also be established that will be an important national resource for transforming clinical practice for the treatment of AH.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Animal studies have increased the knowledge of mechanisms of alcohol induced liver injury. Despite this knowledge, the morbidity and mortality of AH has not improved and there remains a pressing need for new therapeutic strategies and prognostic indicators. Translational studies between basic science and clinical testing have been lacking.

Reducing AAP linked metabolic risks may help cut the 30 years of life lost within this population. Supplemental folate may be a cost effective and low risk method to reduce AAP CVD morbidity and mortality. Folate pharmacogenetics, allows us to mechanistically study AAP metabolic complications and develop personalized medicine within clinical practice. The objective of this project is to compare the effect of folate versus placebo on measures of the metabolic syndrome and CVD risk factors. We will evaluate metabolic laboratory components, and endothelial functioning, in schizophrenia patients receiving AAPs, taking into account pharmacogenetic differences related to folate metabolism. Our primary hypothesis is that folate will attenuate metabolic changes associated with AAP use, thereby contributing to improve endothelial functioning. Variation within the genes facilitating folate metabolism (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and catechol-o-methyl transferase (COMT)) modulate these improvements. We have formulated this hypothesis based on our pilot data obtained during R01MH082784 showing AAPs increase metabolic syndrome risk due to an interaction with MTHFR and COMT. We performed an open-label 3-month folate supplement trial and found significant reductions in metabolic measures and significantly reduced the number of subjects meeting endothelial dysfunction criteria. These improvements were modulated through MTHFR and COMT. The specific aims for this proposal are: 1) Evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness of folic acid supplementation (5mg/day) versus placebo for 16 weeks in schizophrenia subjects and measure sustainability of this effect 8 weeks after supplementation withdrawal, 2) Determine the role of MTHFR and COMT variants on endothelial functioning and metabolic improvements seen with folate supplementation. The innovative approach capitalizes upon a novel strategy to reduce AAP metabolic risks using a novel non-invasive endothelial functioning measurement as a biomarker. This allows for an overall CVD risk estimation compared to focusing on solely weight loss and glucose regulation. The inclusion of pharmacogenomics allows for potential innovative translation of personalized medicine outcomes into practice. Our expected outcomes will demonstrate folate's effectiveness in attenuating metabolic syndrome measures and improvements in endothelial functioning in AAP users with a randomized double blind longitudinal treatment design. Our follow up visit will allow for measurement of any sustained folate effects leading to future dose ranging studies. Successful completion of our pharmacogenetic analyses can be expected to provide a greater mechanistic understanding of AAP metabolic risks. The primary positive impact of our anticipated findings will be an evidence-based scientific framework for folate intervention development for AAP metabolic complications, which can be directly translated into clinical practice.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health relevance of this proposed research is that its successful completion can be expected to provide a cost effective intervention that can be used to significantly reduce the risk of development of cardiovascular problems for patients taking antipsychotic medications to treat their serious mental illness.

Experimental studies suggest that inadequate vitamin D and I-3 fatty acid (FA) levels may be involved in the pathogenesis of HTN through multiple biological mechanisms. Observational studies have shown inverse associations of plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels and dietary I-3 FA intake with blood pressure (BP) and HTN. Small intervention trials of vitamin D and fish oil rich in I-3 FA suggest possible BP-lowering effects; however, larger trials using adequately high doses of vitamin D and I-3 FA for the primary prevention of HTN are lacking. The VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL), an NIH-supported, large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2x2 factorial trial, will test 2000 IU/day of vitamin D (as vitamin D3 [cholecalciferol]) and 1 g/day of marine I-3 FA (eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] + docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) supplements on incident cardiovascular disease and cancer in 20,000 multiethnic men and women with 5 years of treatment and follow-up. VITAL provides an optimal cost-effective setting to examine the effects of both interventions on changes in BP and incident HTN. Further, as this project would begin in parallel with enrollment into the parent VITAL trial, pre-randomization assessments of BP and biomarkers will be possible. In this proposed ancillary study, we will recruit a representative subcohort of 1,000 VITAL participants without baseline HTN from 5 major US metropolitan areas to conduct home-based examinations at baseline and 2 years follow-up through Examination Management Services, Inc (EMSI). We will obtain 24-hour ambulatory BP (ABP), fasting bloods, 24-hour urines, and other clinical assessments in this EMSI subcohort. We will also ascertain incident HTN cases in the overall VITAL trial. We will test the following hypotheses: (1) whether vitamin D and fish oil supplementation lowers 24-hour ABP compared to placebo in the EMSI subcohort of 1,000 participants; (2) whether vitamin D and fish oil supplementation reduces the risk of incident HTN compared to placebo among all randomized VITAL participants without baseline HTN; and (3) whether vitamin D and fish oil supplementation favorably changes HTN-related biomarkers that are putative mechanistic mediators linking vitamin D and I-3 FAs with HTN compared to placebo. This proposed study will provide definitive evidence to support or refute the potential preventive roles of vitamin D and I-3 FA on BP and the development of HTN.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prior research suggests that vitamin D and fish oil (which contains nutrients called omega-3 fatty acids) might help lower blood pressure and prevent hypertension; however, this remains unproven because large and more definitive research studies have not been done. This proposed study will be a large-scale and long-term randomized trial that will demonstrate whether taking vitamin D or fish oil supplements can lower someone's blood pressure or prevent the development of hypertension. Because high blood pressure is responsible for one out of every six deaths in the United States, the results of this study could possibly improve the health of many people.",

Gut-derived endotoxins normally penetrate the gut epithelium in only trace amounts due to tightly regulated intestinal barrier function. However, endotoxin leakiness is increased under pathological conditions, including alcohol abuse. The barrier function of intestinal epithelium Is provided in part by paracellular apical junction complexes, including tight and adherens junctions, and by a mucus layer.  In our initial systems biology approach to ALD, we found that intestinal trefoil factor (ITF) was by far the most altered (~50-fold down regulated) protein in the liver following chronic alcohol feeding in rats, and subsequent studies also showed marked down regulation of ITF mRNA and protein in the intestines of alcohol fed mice. ITF plays a critical role in the formation and stabilization of intestinal mucus barrier and enhancement of rapid intestinal repair 'restitution'. Formation and restitution ofthe barrier is also dependent on uninterrupted mucosal blood flow. Intestinal epithelial cells are positioned between an anaerobic lumen and a highly metabolic lamina propria forming a steep physiologic oxygen gradient. Increased hypoxia- inducible factor (HIF) signaling represents a major adaptive response to hypoxic stress by upregulating a variety of gene products, such as ITF and mucins, to form an integrated epithelial barrier. Our preliminary studies demonstrated that chronic alcohol administration decreases intestinal HIF-2a, ITF and tight junction protein expression resulting in increased endotoxemia and ultimately liver injury. Moreover, supplementation with a probiotic strain, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), increased intestinal HIF-2a and ITF expression, decreased endotoxemia and attenuated alcohol induced liver injury. We hypothesize that alcohol exposure causes detrimental metabolic changes favoring intestinal oxidative stress, inflammation, and alterations of HIF responsive signaling with decreased ITF, leading to intestinal barrier dysfunction, blood endotoxemia and ALD. We postulate that probiotic supplementation will attenuate alcohol-induced intestine and liver injury, in part by increasing HIF-mediated expression of mucus protective factors such as ITF in the intestine. We test our hypothesis with 4 specific aims using in vitro, animal, and human studies approaches. Our ultimate goal is the development of new therapies for ALD. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Alcohol overuse/abuse induces organ injury in multiple organs. This translational research project will examine the mechanisms of the beneficial effects of probiotics on the intestine and the liver in an experimental mouse model of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and in mild human alcoholic hepatitis (AH).","No data",

It is predictive of breast cancer risk for at least 10 years in the futue and has been suggested as a surrogate marker of breast cancer risk. Several states now mandate release of mammographic density data to women. However, except for anti-hormonal therapies (e.g., tamoxifen), no interventions have been proven to reduce breast density. Thus, testing promising, well-tolerated interventions that might affect mammographic density is of substantial interest. Several lines of evidence suggest that vitamin D may play a role in breast density and breast carcinogenesis. Vitamin D reduces proliferation and promotes differentiation and apoptosis in breast cells in culture. However, no large-scale randomized studies have examined the impact of vitamin D on mammographic density. We propose to examine the randomized effects vitamin D3 on mammographic breast density in the NIH sponsored VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL), an ongoing randomized, double blind, trial testing vitamin D3 (2,000 IU/day cholecalciferol) and omega-3 fatty acids (840 mg eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA]+ docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) in the primary prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease in a multi-ethnic population of over 24,000 men and women. In this ancillary sub study, mammograms will be obtained on 4000 women age 55-67 years (25% African-American), from baseline (pre-randomization) and after 1 and 4 years of randomized therapy. Centrally processed quantitative mammographic density and texture variation will be measured. We will determine if randomized vitamin D treatment is associated with change in mammographic features, and whether effects are modified by baseline mammographic density, and baseline 25(OH) vitamin D levels. In addition, tissue samples from women in VITAL undergoing breast biopsy/surgery, for both nonmalignant and malignant conditions, will be collected. Quantitative morphological measures, as well as gene expression assays targeting vitamin D activation and breast carcinogenesis pathways, will be performed on collected tissues among women on randomized vitamin D3 compared with placebo. This ancillary study provides a timely opportunity to test comprehensively the effects of vitamin D3 on mammographic features and breast tissue biology in a randomized setting at minimal additional cost.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Thus far, only hormonal therapies such as tamoxifen have been shown to reduce breast density, and these are associated with a high side effect burden. We propose to examine the randomized effects of vitamin D on mammographic breast density and texture in the ongoing, already-funded VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) study. We will collect baseline (pre-randomization), 1-year and 4-year follow-up mammograms, as well as tissue specimens from women undergoing breast biopsy/surgery for malignant and nonmalignant disease, to further elucidate the role of vitamin D on mammographic features and breast tissue biology. Identifying well-tolerated, promising nutritional agents that could reduce breast density would have important public health implications for women at high risk of breast cancer.",

Notably, the placenta is emerging as a possible source and regulator of circulating maternal vitamin D metabolites because it expresses all components of the vitamin D metabolic pathway and can produce 1,25[OH]2D which doubles during this reproductive state. Nonetheless, few studies have investigated the modulatory role of the placenta on maternal circulating vitamin D metabolites. In addition, although vitamin D is known to influence bone health in the nonpregnant state, it is unclear whether maternal vitamin D status influences maternal and fetal bone health during pregnancy. Animal studies have shown normal bone health outcomes in fetuses from severely vitamin D deficient mice while data from human studies are mixed possibly due to differences among studies in the dietary intakes of calcium, phosphorous, and other nutrients that impact bone health. This study seeks to advance understanding of vitamin D metabolism and requirements during pregnancy by measuring a comprehensive panel of vitamin D biomarkers from pregnant and nonpregnant control women who participated in a feeding study and consumed equivalent intakes of vitamin D and other related nutrients. The Specific Aims are as follows: Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that pregnancy alters blood biomarkers of vitamin D metabolism including 25(OH)D,1,25(OH)2D, 24,25(OH)2D and vitamin D binding protein (DBP). Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that placenta metabolizes vitamin D and contributes to the changes in maternal circulating vitamin D metabolites including 1,25(OH)2D. To achieve this aim, we will measure placental gene and protein expression levels of the megalin-cubilin receptor, 25-hydroxylase (CYP2R1), 1-hydroxylase (CYP27B1), and 24-hydroxylase (CYP24A1) as well as placental metabolite concentrations of 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)2D, 24,25(OH)2D, and DBP. Relationships between placental and maternal biomarkers of vitamin D will be examined and a human placental cell culture model will be employed to investigate vitamin D metabolic flux and guide interpretation of the placental tissue experiments. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that maternal serum 25(OH)D levels associate with maternal and fetal markers of bone metabolism. To achieve this aim, we will examine correlations between maternal markers of vitamin D status (i.e., 25[OH]D and 1,25[OH]2D) and maternal/cord blood levels of biochemical markers of bone health (e.g., parathyroid hormone).           ","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite growing evidence linking vitamin D to maternal and fetal health outcomes during pregnancy, very little is known about the effect of pregnancy on vitamin D metabolism and requirements. The proposed study will address fundamental biological questions on vitamin D metabolism during pregnancy and is expected to advance current understanding of the relationship between maternal vitamin D status and maternal and fetal bone health. The findings from this study offer the exciting potential of being immediately translatable into maternal vitamin D intake recommendations that will promote optimal health in the population-at-large.

ALD is an inherited paroxysmal disease characterized by fatty acid accumulation and subsequent oxidative stress. Forty percent of ALD boys develop inflammatory cerebral demyelination (cerALD) in their first decade of life. Unfortunately, we have no means of identifying boys at risk for cerALD nor do we have any means of preventing the onset of cerebral ALD. These limitations represent enormous gaps in our standard of care for these patients.  To address these limitations, the candidate and his collaborators consider the relationship of several key areas of current knowledge in cerALD: (1) ALD results from a peroxisomal gene defect that causes an accumulation of fatty acids which expose cells to lipid peroxides and other mediators of oxidative stress, (2) monocyte-lineage cells dominate the leading edge of the demyelinating lesions and (3) the lesions shares histologic features with multiple sclerosis lesions, a disease that has been linked to vitamin D insufficiency.  Armed with this knowledge, the candidate has generated preliminary data showing that (1) low serum 25-OH vitamin D levels predict the onset of cerALD; (2) monocytes and brain myelin in ALD males have low glutathione levels compared to controls; (3) the spinal fluid from cerebral ALD boys shows a cytokine expression profile consistent with oxidative stress in monocyte-lineage cells; and lastly, (4) that oral vitamin D3 supplementation in a murine model of autoimmune demyelination significantly reduces clinical disease and increases intracellular glutathione levels in monocytes.  The candidate proposes a pilot trial to study the effect of oral vitamin D3 supplementation on blood and brain biomarkers of oxidative stress in 20 ALD boys who have not yet developed cerebral ALD. In Aim 1 the candidate will use MRI techniques to monitor brain biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation in response to rising vitamin D levels. In Aim 2, the candidate will use 12-color flow cytometry and tandem mass spectrometry to study the effect of oral vitamin D3 supplementation on markers of oxidative stress in the specific immune cell subsets of study participants. In Aim 3, the candidate  will use bio banked ALD monocytes to define the metabolic and immunologic pathways linking vitamin D exposure with glutathione and cytokine modulation. The candidate's long term goal is to develop treatments and biomarkers for the prevention of cerebral ALD. The addition of ALD to universal newborn screening panels in an increasing number of US states bolsters the project's immediate relevance.          ","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) affects an estimated 1:17,000 individuals with men more severely affected than women. Nearly 40% of ALD boys develop severe inflammatory cerebral demyelination (cerebral ALD) during the first decade of life, a complication that is often fatal. There is no available treatment for preventing the onset f cerebral ALD. The proposed work expands on the candidate's observation that low pre- morbid serum vitamin D levels with later onset of cerebral ALD. It specifically examines the effect of ora vitamin D3 supplements on markers of oxidative stress in ALD boys. This has implications for the use of vitamin D3 supplements as a preventive therapy for cerebral ALD, which in turn has implications for newborn screening for ALD.                    ",

As life expectancy increases, co-morbidities such as CF-related diabetes (CFRD) become more prevalent. It is thus increasingly important to identify pathophysiologic pathways that will inform nutritional therapies for adult patients with CF. Recent advances in metabolomics analysis provide a novel opportunity to broadly explore metabolism and underlying pathways relevant to disease exacerbation and recovery in CF. The PI, Jessica A. Alvarez, PhD, RD, will use high-resolution, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomics methods as a tool to interrogate the plasma metabolome in cohorts of adult CF patients, with or without CFRD, in collaboration with a multidisciplinary team of expert mentors (including Lead Mentor Dr. Thomas R. Ziegler and Co-Mentors Drs. Dean P. Jones, Vin Tangpricha, Arlene A. Stecenko, and Nael A. McCarty). Based on preliminary clinical and metabolomics research findings by the PI and the mentoring team, the working hypotheses of this project are: 1) aminothiol redox imbalance in CF contributes to impaired fatty acid �-oxidation, and 2) vitamin D supplementation normalizes the redox system and, subsequently, �-oxidation. Specific Aim 1 is to confirm a defect in �- oxidation in adult CF subjects using high-resolution targeted plasma metabolomics analysis and complementary in vivo bioenergetic assessment methods (indirect calorimetry,31phosphorus-magnetic resonance spectroscopy) in a cross-sectional study of adult subjects with CF compared to healthy, age matched controls.

However, because of potential confounding in observational studies and lack of data from adequately powered trials designed for glycemic and other metabolic outcomes, it remains unclear whether vitamin D has a clinical role in patients with established t2DM. The goal of this renewal application for a New Investigator R01, which directly extends our work in this area conducted during the first funding cycle, is to evaluate whether vitamin D is an effective non-pharmacologic nutritional intervention for t2DM. The central hypothesis is that suboptimal vitamin D status worsens glycemia in t2DM and that raising one's 25OHD concentration with vitamin D supplementation improves glycemia and other metabolic outcomes in patients with established t2DM, through improvements in insulin secretion and sensitivity. A secondary hypothesis is that the effect of vitamin D is modified by specific Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) polymorphisms. We plan to test our central hypothesis and accomplish the goals of this application by conducting a 1-year long randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D3 supplementation in persons with established t2DM of mild/moderate severity. Declining vitamin D status is a consequence of our altered lifestyle and its strong association with t2DM, after adjusting for other lifestyle factors (weight, diet), makes the proposed study very important and timely and also consistent with national research priorities as the study is expected to fill a fundamental knowledge gap which fuels the current intense controversy in relation to the development of recommendations for vitamin D supplementation for non-skeletal medical conditions.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance of the proposed project to public health: The proposed study addresses alternative therapeutic options for an important public health problem, type 2 diabetes. If the favorable association between vitamin D status and type 2 diabetes that have been reported in observational studies is confirmed in the clinically relevant trial, we propose, vitamin D can assume its proper role alongside established therapies to treat type 2 diabetes in the more than 26 million Americans with the disease. Relevance of the proposed project to the mission of the NIH (NIDDK and the Office of Dietary Supplements [ODS]): The research addresses important health issues of relevance to both NIDDK and ODS. Nutrition and type 2 diabetes are two obvious areas of interest to NIDDK while vitamin D is a nutrient of significant interest to ODS. Indeed, as stated in its strategic planning for 2010-14, te ODS is leading a Vitamin D Initiative, which is an evolving partnership with NIH institutes and centers and other federal agencies to fund research that address gaps in knowledge, as identified by the 2011 Institute of Medicine report on Dietary Reference Intakes for calcium and vitamin D.",

Despite enthusiasm for the use of vitamin D for bone health, there are limited data on the effects of high-dose vitamin D supplements vs. placebo on bone health and body composition outcomes. Previous data support a positive relationship between 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH) D] levels and bone mineral density (BMD). However, results from clinical trials that test vitamin D supplementation alone on areal BMD (aBMD) are sparse and inconsistent, and it is not known whether vitamin D can prevent or reverse the structural deterioration characteristic of osteoporosis. Recent advances in bone imaging make it possible to assess volumetric BMD (vBMD), structure, and micro- architecture non-invasively with high-resolution peripheral computed tomography (HR-pQCT). In addition, observational studies show an inverse relationship between 25(OH) D levels and body mass index (BMI). Since vitamin D is stored in fat, new dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measures of adiposity can advance understanding of this relationship and determine whether or not supplemental vitamin D has effects on body composition. We propose an ancillary study to the NIH-sponsored, Vitamin D and OmegA-3 Trial (VITAL) (U01 CA138962), an ongoing, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol, 2000 IU/d) and/or marine omega-3 fatty acids (1 gm/d) in 20,000 men and women, to test the effects of vitamin D3 on BMD, geometry, architecture, and body composition. In a sub-cohort of 600 participants recruited from the NIH-sponsored Clinical and Translational Science Center (CTSC) in Boston, we seek to test the following hypotheses, with measures at baseline and year 2: Aim 1: High-dose vitamin D3 will (a) produce small increases in aBMD at the spine, hip, forearm and total body, as assessed by DXA and (b) improve balance of bone remodeling through decreases in bone turnover; Aim 2: High-dose vitamin D3 will improve: vBMD and bone structure and architecture at the distal radius and tibia, as assessed by HR-pQCT and bone strength estimates; Aim 3: High-dose vitamin D3 will result in lower (a) total body fat and fat mass index (FMI-fat mass/height2) and/or b) regional fat measures, as assessed by DXA. For each Aim, we will determine whether effects vary with (a) baseline 25(OH) D levels, (b) gender, (c) race/skin pigmentation, and (d) BMI or FMI. We will also define how the 25(OH) D levels corresponding to high-dose vitamin D supplementation affects these bone health and body composition outcomes. In order to complete pre-randomization testing in this sub-cohort, it is critical that this ancillary study be undertaken during the CTSC baseline visits, which begin December, 2011 and extend to early 2013. The proposed studies will provide positive or informative negative results about effects of vitamin D3 alone on bone health and body composition, and enhance understanding of the skeletal mechanisms through which vitamin D may affect fracture outcomes evaluated in a separate study (AR060574). Findings from this proposal will fill gaps in knowledge and inform clinical and public health recommendations.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purported health benefits of vitamin D are receiving wide attention in the medical literature and the popular press. While some data support a benefit of vitamin D on fracture reduction, there is no information on the effects of high-dose vitamin D on bone structure and architecture and the effects of adiposity on these relationships. Findings from these clinical studies including advanced imaging techniques will elucidate the role of vitamin D on bone mass, architecture and body composition in men and women enrolled in the VITAL study.",

The study builds on extensive epidemiological and experimental data indicating that both vitamin D and calcium have anti-neoplastic effects in the large bowel and that these agents interact, each requiring the other for full effect. Despite the strong supporting data, randomized trials are needed to confirm the purported efficacy of vitamin D, clarify its persistence, and assess the possible interaction with calcium. Experience with previous candidate chemopreventive agents for large bowel neoplasia shows that observation of a single colonoscopic surveillance cycle provides an incomplete evaluation of efficacy. Some agents have shown maximal effects only with longer follow-up; others have shown 'rebound' increases in adenoma risk after treatment ends.  Eligible subjects for the trial had a recent adenoma and no known polyps remaining in the large bowel. A total of 2259 subjects have been randomized to calcium carbonate (1200 mg calcium/day), vitamin D (1000 IU/day), both agents, or placebo. Women were offered the choice of being randomized to calcium alone or calcium plus vitamin D. Colonoscopic follow-up is either 3 years or 5 years after the qualifying exam, as planned by each subject's gastroenterologist. The main endpoint of the study is one or more neoplastic polyps of the bowel on follow-up; advanced lesions and multiple lesions are secondary endpoints. After completion of study treatment, subjects are followed for one subsequent colonoscopic surveillance cycle.  The study has successfully met its milestones during the first 10 years of funding. Enrollment proceeded according to schedule and subjects have shown very good compliance with study procedures and agents. Recruitment into the post-treatment follow-up has been excellent.  We now request funds for the final phases of the study: completion of treatment for a few subjects, post- treatment follow-up, and analyses of on-treatment and post-treatment adenoma occurrence.  In our main analyses, we will assess the effect of vitamin D alone vs. placebo and that of vitamin D + calcium vs. calcium alone and also test whether there is a 'rebound' in adenoma risk after cessation of vitamin D treatment. Under conservative assumptions, we will have greater than 95% power to detect a 20% reduction in adenoma recurrence with vitamin D vs. placebo, 89% power to detect a 25% reduction with calcium plus vitamin D vs. calcium alone and 80% power to reject a non-inferiority hypothesis regarding vitamin D vs. placebo, with an inferiority margin of 0.065 during post-treatment follow-up. Our secondary analyses will address advanced and multiple lesions, the interaction of calcium and vitamin D, and the modifying effects of baseline 25-OH vitamin D levels and polymorphisms in the vitamin D receptor on vitamin D treatment effects.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers in the U.S. This study aims to confirm in a clinical trial that supplementation with calcium or vitamin D can reduce the risk of colorectal adenomas, benign tumors that can evolve into cancer if left in place.

The trial began recruitment in 1985 and was halted in January 1996, 21 months ahead of schedule, with the twin conclusions of no benefit and substantial evidence of a harmful effect of the intervention on both lung cancer incidence and total mortality. Participants were followed for over nine years post-intervention, with updated lung cancer incidence and cardiovascular disease mortality findings published in 2004. On June 30, 2005, CARET stopped active follow-up of participants. During the active intervention phase of CARET, serum, plasma, whole blood, and lung tissue specimens were collected. These biospecimens make up the CARET biorepository which is the focus of this UMl application. The CARET biorepository is a key tool in studying disease development and progression and is an invaluable legacy of the parent trial and has been open to any investigator with a hypothsis driven project.

We have recently developed and validated a two-compartment model of individual subject ozone exposure-response. The first compartment represents the delay to or cumulative dose of ozone at the onset of physiologic response. The second compartment is a fixed volume with a constant rate of elimination of a bioactive substance that activates the deep lung neural receptors that induce rapid shallow breathing and reductions in inspiratory capacity (ie decreased FEV1). The output of these two serially linked compartments is then multiplied by a proportionality coefficient A. Our central hypothesis is that vitamin C and uric acid contained within the respiratory tract lining fluid contributes to the antioxidant capaciy of the airway and the delay in onset of ozone-induced reflex decrements in pulmonary function and subjective symptoms. Our goal is a better understanding of the role of soluble antioxidants in determining ozone exposure response kinetics. These findings will provide further insight into how vitamin C and uric acid dietary modulation reduces the risk of developing pulmonary function decrements in individuals exposed to ambient levels of ozone. We will focus on individual subject ozone exposure-response kinetics and how they are altered by dietary modulation of vitamin C and uric acid. The systems biology approach of combining modeling of individual subject ozone exposure-response kinetics with vitamin C and uric acid dietary modulation will improve the integrated understanding of ozone-induced responses in humans. The proposed experiments will measure the system and its key responses while the computational model will be used to integrate the information to test our hypothesis. We expect that vitamin C and uric acid dietary modulation while attenuating ozone-induced decrements in FEV1 will also increase the number of subjects with a dose of onset in excess of the total cumulative dose of exposure and as a result have no pulmonary function or subjective symptom response with ozone exposure.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ozone-induced physiologic and symptomatic responses can be viewed as being the result of a complex cascade of events. This cascade is composed of multiple interrelated stages. The goal of this application is to use a systems biology approach to examine the role of soluble antioxidants in determining ozone exposure response kinetics. These findings will provide further insight into how vitamin C and uric acid dietary modulation reduces the risk of developing pulmonary function decrements in individuals exposed to ambient levels of ozone.",

Recently, the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency was recognized to be very high in the US pediatric population and low serum vitamin D were found to be strongly and independently associated with hypertension, hyperglycemia, and metabolic syndrome, independent of adiposity or other CVD risk factors. As HIV-infected children are expected to live several decades, issues of long- term toxicities, such as CVD and diabetes become increasingly important in the management of HIV. The central hypothesis of our proposed studies is that, vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor for the development of subclinical atherosclerosis and insulin resistance in HIV infected children/young adults, and that the risk is mediated by changes in systemic inflammation. To strengthen the findings from the observational study, we will conduct an interventional study, in which we hypothesize that high doses of vitamin D given to HIV-infected children/young adults with low vitamin D levels will increase 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels at a lower extent than in a matched healthy HIV-negative control group, specifically in patients treated with NNRTI, and will reduce inflammation, insulin resistance and dyslipidemias. Detailed measures of vitamin D pathways will also be determined. The use of vitamin D has the potential to have a significant impact on prevention of HIV cardiovascular and metabolic co-morbidities especially given that the intervention can be implemented easily and inexpensively in clinical practice.","Children living with HIV are surviving through adulthood; however they are suffering from several complications of HIV and its therapy, including increased risk of heart disease and diabetes. Vitamin D can positively modify inflammation, a known risk factor for heart disease and diabetes, and as such has been shown in the general population to improve cardiovascular risk. This study will examine the relationship between vitamin D levels and cardiovascular and metabolic complications and the interplay of inflammation. We will also study the effect of vitamin D supplementation in HIV infected children/youths on cardiac and metabolic morbidities. Lastly, a detailed assessment of the effect of HIV therapies on vitamin D metabolism will be undertaken.",

Heavy alcohol use and HIV infection are both causes of microbial translocation, the process by which bacterial products from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract leak across the GI membrane to the portal circulation. Microbial translocation causes immune activation leading to end organ damage. Alcohol can cause microbial translocation via zinc deficiency. Zinc deficiency is common among HIV+ heavy drinkers and linked to high mortality rates. Zinc supplementation is affordable, available, does not interfere with ART, and has minimal adverse drug reactions. In animal models zinc reduces ethanol associated microbial translocation. In human studies zinc slows HIV disease progression and reduces levels of inflammatory biomarkers which are strongly linked to mortality. Given zinc's potential efficacy we propose to conduct Zinc for INflammation and Chronic disease in HIV (ZINC HIV), a double-blinded randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of zinc supplementation vs. placebo among 250 HIV+ Russians, who are ART-naive at enrollment and have a recent history of heavy drinking. We will recruit most of our participants from the Russia cohort within the Uganda Russia Boston Alcohol Network for Alcohol Research Collaboration on HIV/AIDS (URBAN ARCH) Consortium study. Our specific aims will test the efficacy of zinc supplementation, compared to placebo to (1) improve markers of mortality as measured by the VACS index; (2) slow HIV disease progression as measured by CD4 cell count; (3) improve markers of AMI risk as measured by the Reynolds risk score; and (4) lower levels of microbial translocation and inflammation as measured by serum biomarkers. We hypothesize that as compared with placebo, patients receiving zinc supplementation will have significantly lower AMI and mortality risk as measured by the VACS index and Reynolds risk scores; higher CD4 cell counts; lower levels of biomarkers for microbial translocation and inflammation. Importantly, if our hypotheses are true, zinc supplementation could ultimately become a standard adjunctive therapy complementing alcohol interventions among HIV+ persons even in resource limited environments.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The combination of heavy alcohol consumption and HIV infection results in serious health problems and an increased risk of death. Although it is not exactly clear how alcohol and HIV do this, inflammation appears to play an important role. Zinc supplementation has anti-inflammatory properties.

"5","U01","DK097093-03","A Novel Approach to Phosphorus Lowering in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease","","30-Apr-2016","Ix, Joachim H","UNITED STATES","511543","2015","DK","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is highly prevalent and strongly associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Because traditional CVD risk factors do not fully explain the link between CKD and CVD, it is likely that 'non-traditional' risk factors that are altered in CKD may be involved. Among such factors, higher serum phosphorus (Pi) levels represent a causal candidate, and may be modifiable.  Higher serum Pi induces arterial calcification, arterial stiffness, and left ventricular hypertrophy in animals. Similar fidings are observed in humans, and higher Pi levels are also associated with the development and progression of CKD, CVD events and mortality in humans. The KDIGO international clinical practice guidelines recommend targeting Pi within the normal range and recommends using oral phosphorus binders (OPBs) to do so. However, since the recommendations were published, studies have consistently shown that OPBs have minimal efficacy for Pi lowering in CKD stage 3-4, even with very high doses and pill burden, and may be associated with harm. In contrast, animal studies and pilot studies in humans show that nicotinamide (vitamin B3) substantially lowers serum Pi levels, and can do so with only 1-2 pills/day. Nicotinamide reduces Pi through a different mechanism. Rather than binding Pi, it blocks intestinal Pi absorption by down-regulating a key intestinal Pi transporter. The lipid drug niacin contains both nicotinamide and nicotinic acid, and we have shown that it lowers Pi in CKD patients. However, nicotinamide alone may have advantages. Unlike niacin, it does not cause flushing, liver test abnormalities, hyperuricemia, or insulin resistance. Nicotinamide has considerable long-term safety data in the general population, is available over the counter as a dietary supplement in the US, and would cost about $2/patient/month. Thus, nicotinamide may provide a readily available, well-tolerated, inexpensive, and convenient method to lower serum Pi levels in patients with CKD.  However, the efficacy of nicotinamide for Pi lowering in CKD stage 3-4 is unknown. Moreover, the effects of nicotinamide on other components of mineral metabolism including urine phosphorus excretion and counter- regulatory hormones FGF23, PTH, and calcitriol are unknown. Changes in these factors may have their own influences on CVD, CKD progression, and bone health. Thus, nicotinamide is not yet ready for widespread clinical use in CKD patients. The efficacy for Pi lowering and effects on other components of mineral metabolism must first be established.  We propose a phase 2, randomized double blind placebo controlled study among 150 patients with eGFR 20-45ml/min/1.73m2 treated with nicotinamide or placebo for 6 months. Our primary aims are to determine (1) the Pi lowering efficacy, (2) the effects of nicotinamide on other components of mineral metabolism including urine phosphorus excretion and Pi regulatory hormones. If effective and well tolerated, this study will rapidly alter the standard of care by introducing icotinamide for Pi lowering in CKD stage 3-4.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Most patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) die of cardiovascular disease (CVD) before they ever progress to kidney failure, retention of serum phosphorus is a potential explanatory factor, and clinical practice guidelines suggest keeping serum phosphorus concentrations within the normal range in CKD patients. Existing therapies to lower phosphorus in CKD are minimally effective, and may cause harm. We have identified an inexpensive, readily available, convenient vitamin (nicotinamide) that substantially lowers serum phosphorus. This study will establish the phosphorus lowering efficacy of nicotinamide, and its effects on other components of mineral bone disease in CKD patients.",

This proposal will assess interventions aimed at preventing CTIBL in postmenopausal breast cancer patients caused by aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy, which results in a 2- to 4-fold increase in bone loss and significantly increase fracture risk in this population. The research project will tet the efficacy of high-dose vitamin D supplementation plus a personalized weight-bearing exercise program to prevent CTIBL. Career Development Plan: Dr. Peppone's previous experience as an epidemiologist specializing in cancer, combined with his ongoing training as a clinical cancer control researcher, makes him well-suited to become a independent researcher with a focus on the pathogenesis and treatment of CTIBL. His training goals will expand upon his knowledge and are divided into three training aims: 1) to develop expertise in the biology, physiology, genetics, and measurement of CTIBL, 2) to gain experience as a PI in the design, conduct, and analysis of Phase II/III randomized controlled clinical trials, and 3) to gain experience in the testing and implementation of a nutritional supplement intervention (vitamin D) and behavioral interventions (exercise) for CTIBL. Dr. Gary Morrow, a leading cancer control researcher for the past thirty years, will serve as Dr. Peppone's principal senior mentor and offer guidance in the area of clinical trial conduct. Co-mentor Dr. Randy Rosier and Advisor Dr. Alissa Huston will provide expertise in the biology, physiology, and contributing factors of CTIBL. Co-mentor Dr. Mary Reid and Advisor Donald Trump offer experience in the efficacy and pharmacology of vitamin D for the management of CTIBL, while co-mentor Dr. Karen Mustian will train Dr. Peppone in the development and implementation of exercise interventions for CTIBL. Advisor Dr. Godfrey will provide training in genetic analysis and Advisor Dr. Heckler will offer statistical training. Research Plan: The proposed pilot RCT, based upon both biological plausibility and feasibility data, is a three-arm study that tests two interventions for the prevention of cancer-treatment-induced bone loss in 105 moderately vitamin D deficient (11-32 ng/ml) postmenopausal breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant AI therapy. The proposed clinical trial aims to evaluate the efficacy of: 1) high-dose vitamin D supplementation, 2) high-dose vitamin D supplementation plus an individually tailored home-based weight-bearing aerobic (walking) and progressive resistance exercise program, compared to 3) low-dose vitamin D supplementation on bone metabolism and bone mineral density.

In this application, we propose to examine the role of the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin, and its primary regulator vitamin D, in lung function impairment, respiratory infections and acute exacerbations of COPD as well as evaluate the effect of oral vitamin D supplementation on lung cathelicidin levels in humans. Cathelicidin has bactericidal and inflammatory activities in the lung and is regulated by vitamin D levels. Our hypothesis is that reduced cathelicidin levels are associated with accelerated lung function decline though a pathway partially mediated by increased infections and COPD exacerbations. We hypothesize the effect of cathelicidin on lung function is greater in those with vitamin D insufficiency and that oral vitamin D supplementation will raise cathelicidin levels in the pulmonary compartment, thereby restoring lung cathelicidin deficiency. Specifically, through longitudinal investigation nested within an ongoing cohort study of urban, predominantly African-American individuals at high risk for development of OLDs, we will characterize the rate of lung function decline in 380 participants followed with serial spirometry measures for up to six years. Baseline and repeated measures of cathelicidin and vitamin D will be examined as independent predictors of lung function decline and respiratory infections. Separately, using longitudinal data from 2100 participants enrolled in the Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study (SPIROMICS) study with established COPD, baseline measures of blood cathelicidin and vitamin D will be examined as an independent predictor of longitudinal FEV1 decline and COPD exacerbations over three years. In both cohorts, concurrent vitamin D measurements will permit evaluation of antecedent and modifier on the cathelicidin-lung outcomes relationships. Finally, we will measure blood and lung lavage cathelicidin levels in 40 vitamin D insufficient individuals before and after eight weeks of oral vitamin D supplementation to determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on cathelicidin levels. Completion of these aims will provide a robust determination of the role of  cathelicidin in lung function decline and adverse pulmonary outcomes in unique populations of at-risk and diseased individuals. Moreover, the aims of this application directly or indirectly wor towards ultimately understanding if a readily measurable blood marker, cathelicidin, can inform who may benefit from vitamin D supplementation to prevent chronic lung disease. The results from this application would lead to a therapeutic intervention study that will provide further opportunities to improve our understanding of the relationship between vitamin D, cathelicidin and lung function.          ","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal will evaluate a potential mechanism of increased risk of lung function impairment, as well as determine if vitamin D replacement can alter this pathway. This application will improve the understanding of factors which can lead to chronic lung disease.

The study will leverage invaluable resources and data from the VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2x2 factorial trial designed to test vitamin D (vitamin D3 [cholecalciferol], 2000 IU/d) and marine omega-3 fatty acid (eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] + docosahexaenoic acid [DHA], 1 g/d) supplements in the primary prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease. The National Institutes of Health (1U01CA138962) is funding the main VITAL trial, which will study 20,000 men aged e60 y and women aged $ e65 y. Beginning in October 2010 and continuing throughout 2011, willing and eligible respondents to an $ invitational mailing will be enrolled in a 3-month run-in, and subsequently those who remain willing and eligible, and who report having taken at least two-thirds of study pills, will be randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups for 5 years: vitamin D3 (2000 IU/d) and fish oil (EPA+DHA, 1 g/d); vitamin D3 and fish oil placebo; vitamin D3 placebo and fish oil; and vitamin D3 placebo and fish oil placebo. At 1-year intervals, participants will receive a new supply of pills and a follow-up questionnaire on compliance, possible side effects, and incidence of endpoints. We propose to ascertain prevalent and incident AMD endpoints in the VITAL cohort in order to study the efficacy of vitamin D3 and fish oil in AMD prevention. The Primary Aims of this ancillary study are to test whether: 1) fish oil supplementation (EPA+DHA, 1g/d) reduces the incidence and progression of AMD and whether 2) vitamin D3 supplementation (2000 IU/d) reduces the incidence and progression of AMD. Secondary Aims will test for synergistic or antagonistic effects of vitamin D3 and fish oil, as well as interactions of vitamin D3 and fish oil with common AMD-associated genetic polymorphisms, and polymorphisms related to pathways involved in vitamin D3 or omega-3 fatty acid metabolic activity. This research is responsive to a program priority of the National Eye Institute's Strategic Plan to develop new treatments for AMD. We believe the timely start of the proposed AMD ancillary to the VITAL trial offers a unique but time-sensitive opportunity to obtain a reliable, efficient, and informative evaluation o the efficacy of two extremely promising preventive agents for AMD at a fraction of the cost of separate trials.

Our long-term goal is to broaden the knowledge to improve HF outcomes, quality of life and prognosis of HF patients with MDD, and to reduce the economic burden resulting from these conditions. Depression is a serious public health concern that contributes to significant morbidity and mortality in patients with cardiac diseases. While only SSRIs, among a broad range of antidepressants on the market, are considered a safe type of antidepressant for patients with cardiac diseases, sertraline failed to show superiority over placebo in reducing depression or cardiac outcomes in the recently completed, well designed and conducted SADHART-CHF trial consisting of among 469 HF patients with MDD. The SADHART-CHF biomarker substudy demonstrated that Omega 3 is low and associated with increased mortality in the SADHART-CHF participants. This biomarker study indicates that within the context of low omega 3, SSRI may be detrimental for HF patients. Omega 3 supplements improve CV prognosis in HF patients but whether it improves depression for the depressed HF patients is unknown. Based on a thorough literature review and the opinion of experts, we chose to investigate in a placebo controlled trial, the antidepressant effects of two omega 3 supplements, 400/200 EPA/DHA Fish Oil capsule X4 and almost pure EPA 2g, taken daily (12-weeks) for patients with HF and moderate-to-severe MDD. We will assess the omega 3 concentration prior to and after 12 weeks of supplementation in order to assess how changes in omega 3 relate to treatment responses. The results of this multi-site pilot study will provide data to allow an accurate sample calculation in a subsequent RCT and guidance on selection of psychiatric and biological outcomes for use in a subsequent clinical trial and the clinical value of measuring omega 3 concentrations to guide omega 3 supplementation for individualized care. .

Low bone mineral density (BMD) in childhood increases the risk of early osteoporosis and bone fracture later in life, which has serious individual and societal implications due to the impaired mobility, the associated morbidity and even mortality in older adults. Our long-term goal is to identify vulnerable pediatri populations at risk for bone loss in order to improve their bone health through an early intervention. This study focuses on the prevention of bone loss that occurs in children and adolescents treated with hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for hematologic malignancies. An increase in bone resorption that occurs after HCT in these patients offers an opportunity for intervention with an anti-resorptive agent, yet no prospective studies have been performed that examine the effectiveness of any bisphosphonate or other anti-resorptive agent in pediatric HCT recipients. Therefore, we propose to conduct a prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial of calcium and vitamin D plus pamidronate versus calcium and vitamin D alone to prevent bone loss after pediatric HCT. The central hypothesis is that subjects treated with pamidronate and calcium and vitamin D (Pamidronate Group) will have higher bone mineral content (BMC) and BMD measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and by peripheral quantitative CT, respectively, at 1 year post-HCT than subjects receiving calcium and vitamin D alone (Control Group). The rationale for this study is that treatment with pamidronate at the time of peak bone resorption can prevent/reverse bone loss and have a positive long-term impact on bone health in pediatric HCT recipients. We will pursue three specific aims: 1) To determine the impact of calcium and vitamin D plus pamidronate versus calcium and vitamin D alone on BMC and BMD following HCT in 60 recipients aged 1-18 years at HCT; 2) To characterize the time course of changes in cytokine levels (IL-6, IL-7, TNF-a) associated with the activation of osteoclasts after HCT and their association with BMC and BMD; 3) To examine the sequence of changes in markers of bone turnover after HCT and their response to pamidronate treatment. The current study is innovative in that it is the first to prospectively evaluate the effects of an anti- resortive agent administered shortly after HCT on BMC and BMD in children. This study is expected to have an important positive impact on bone health in children and the field of pediatric endocrinology by providing much needed prospective data on the effectiveness of an anti-resorptive agent after pediatric HCT. The preventive intervention that this project seeks to examine is likely to have an impact on current clinical practice. While biomarkers of bone turnover have been used in adult studies, there is a striking paucity of data on the clinical applicability of these markers in children and adolescents. Evaluating changes in these markers and cytokines after HCT will provide insight into the underlying mechanisms of bone loss.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hematopoietic cell transplantation is being utilized for an increasing number of both malignant and non- malignant disorders and the overall success rates of the procedure continues to improve. Therefore we are now seeing more and more patients who are survivors, but also more who face the long-term consequences of this very intensive form of therapy. Low bone mineral density is increasingly being recognized as a common consequence of bone marrow transplantation. Since childhood and adolescence are critical time periods for establishing peak bone mass for the rest of the adult life, it is importat to intervene early to prevent bone loss and reduce the risk of early osteoporosis and fracture later in life, which can have a significant impact on functional outcomes, ability to work, as well as quality of life.",

Heavy alcohol consumption and HIV infection are both causes of microbial translocation, the process by which bacterial products leak across the gastrointestinal membrane with resultant destructive immune activation. Alcohol can lead to microbial translocation directly through zinc deficiency. Low zinc levels, affecting 30-50% of alcohol dependent persons, are associated w ith reduced immune function and HIV disease progression. Among HIV-infected people, high levels of microbial translocation (as measured by soluble CD14) and inflammation/altered coagulation (as measured by D- dimer) are each associated with an increased risk of death. Of importance, among HIV-infected persons, heavy drinking is also significantly associated with higher levels of D-dimer in cross-sectional studies. Of note, initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is associated with a reduction in D-dimer levels. Yet the following is not known: is there a longitudinal relationship between alcohol consumption and these biomarkers independent of ART; and does zinc supplementation improve biomarker levels? Answering these questions requires a setting with prevalent HIV infection, heavy alcohol use and limited current ART use. As Russia has a relatively young, expanding HIV epidemic, a growing HIV treatment infrastructure and enormous per capita alcohol consumption, St. Petersburg is a setting where this research is possibi e. Thus, as part of the Uganda, Russia, Boston Alcohol Network for Alcohol Research Collaboration on HIV/AIDS (URBAN ARCH) Consortium, we seek to create the Russia ARCH cohort from participants of a recently completed NIAAA-funded randomized controlled trial (RCT) of HIV-infected Russian heavy drinkers and perform the following: [1] an assessment of the longitudinal association between alcohol consumption and biomarkers of microbial translocation (sCD14) and inflammation/altered coagulation (D-dimer); [2] implementation of the Zinc Intervention Nested in a Cohort (ZINC) study, a double-blinded, placebo controlled, RCT to determine if short term zinc supplementation results in lower biomarker levels and whether the effects differ based on alcohol consum ption.

Besecker, M.D. is an Assistant Professor in the Pulmonary and Critical Care Division at The Ohio State University. Dr. Besecker's initial basic science research evaluated zinc's cytoprotective role in lung epithelia. Recently she has been involved in translational research evaluating the role of zinc in bacterial phagocytosis and clearance in sepsis. Dr. Besecker utilizes both an in vitro and murine in vivo model for her zinc-related phagocytosis studies. She has also conducted two observational studies evaluating zinc's relation to the severity of illness and mortality in critically ill septi patients. Dr. Besecker's short term goal is to obtain training in both immunobiology specific to innate immunity/ bacterial clearance and clinical research design and implementation to allow her to transition to an independent translational researcher in the areas of zinc immunobiology and sepsis. A longer term goal is to develop and lead a translational, multi-center research program that focuses on optimizing nutrition to improve patient outcomes in the critically ill. Support from a K23 Mentored Career Development Award would provide the foundation to attain these goals. Career Development: Dr. Besecker's career development/ training will cover 4 Core Areas and include: 1) Laboratory techniques- flow cytometry and animal surgery; 2) Design and management of interventional clinical trials; 3) Project Management/ Organization of Research Programs; 4) Core Knowledge- immunobiology, pharmacology, and biostatistics. Training will also be enhanced by interaction with mentor team members and participation in local and international meetings.

Research: Sepsis, a systemic inflammatory response to infection, kills over 215,000 patients and costs 16 billion dollars annually. Zinc has immune regulatory and cell protective properties and may be an important therapy for improved survival in patients with sepsis. Central Hypothesis: Zinc supplementation in septic subjects improves monocyte/macrophage (Mo/M�) phagocytosis and consequently improves bacterial clearance, inflammatory balance, and mortality. Aim 1: Determine whether maximization of Mo/M� phagocytosis by zinc supplementation in Zn and ZD septic mice can improve bacterial burden, inflammatory balance, and mortality and determine the contribution of Fc?R and CR3 expression and function to phagocytosis Aim 2: Determine the safety and toxicity profile of zinc supplementation over a range that may impact plasma zinc status, bacterial phagocytosis, and inflammatory balance in patients with severe sepsis","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sepsis is the term used to describe the body's response to a serious infection and this condition is the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, killing over 215,000 patients per year.

Heavy alcohol use and HIV infection are both causes of microbial translocation, the process by which bacterial products from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract leak across the GI membrane to the portal circulation. Microbial translocation causes immune activation leading to end organ damage. Alcohol can cause microbial translocation via zinc deficiency. Zinc deficiency is common among HIV+ heavy drinkers and linked to high mortality rates. Zinc supplementation is affordable, available, does not interfere with ART, and has minimal adverse drug reactions. In animal models zinc reduces ethanol associated microbial translocation. In human studies zinc slows HIV disease progression and reduces levels of inflammatory biomarkers which are strongly linked to mortality. Given zinc's potential efficacy we propose to conduct Zinc for INflammation and Chronic disease in HIV (ZINC HIV), a double-blinded randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of zinc supplementation vs. placebo among 250 HIV+ Russians, who are ART-naive at enrollment and have a recent history of heavy drinking. We will recruit most of our participants from the Russia cohort within the Uganda Russia Boston Alcohol Network for Alcohol Research Collaboration on HIV/AIDS (URBAN ARCH) Consortium study. Our specific aims will test the efficacy of zinc supplementation, compared to placebo to (1) improve markers of mortality as measured by the VACS index; (2) slow HIV disease progression as measured by CD4 cell count; (3) improve markers of AMI risk as measured by the Reynolds risk score; and (4) lower levels of microbial translocation and inflammation as measured by serum biomarkers. We hypothesize that as compared with placebo, patients receiving zinc supplementation will have significantly lower AMI and mortality risk as measured by the VACS index and Reynolds risk scores; higher CD4 cell counts; lower levels of biomarkers for microbial translocation and inflammation.

Her research is focused on the extra-skeletal actions of vitamin D and the unique challenges of managing vitamin D deficiency in patients with glomerular diseases complicated by nephrotic-range proteinuria. Vitamin D deficiency may be an important modifiable risk factor for renal disease progression and complications in these patients. Many small studies documented very low total 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels in nephrotic patients, but the underlying pathophysiology is poorly understood. Further, the safety and efficacy of supplementation in this sizeable patient population must be determined in order to prevent both potential toxicity and under-treatment. The candidate's preliminary work demonstrated that glomerular disease, particularly focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), was an independent risk factor for low total and free 25(OH) D levels and vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) in children with chronic kidney disease. These findings implicate impaired tubular reabsorption of 25(OH) D-DBP complexes and/or increased vitamin D catabolism. The proposed project comprises: (1) an ancillary cross-sectional study of 450 participants in the NIH-funded Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE) and (2) a pilot study of cholecalciferol supplementation in 35 children and young adults with FSGS. Leveraging NEPTUNE's unique repository of standardized histopathology data, this work will be the first to determine the association between tubulointerstitial injury an vitamin D metabolites and to delineate the impact of fibroblast growth factor 23-promoted catabolism on vitamin D levels in these patients. The supplementation study will address the safety and efficacy of calciferol supplementation in proteinuric FSGS patients and use novel translational measures of innate immunity and intra-renal inflammation to assess the response to supplementation. The findings of this work will be critical to the design and conduct of subsequent vitamin D trials, and to the development of supplementation guidelines.

The mortality in this group of patients is unacceptably high. A majority of the deaths are due to cardiovascular diseases, followed by infectious complications and protein-energy wasting. Strategies to reduce the mortality of MHD patients, including those directed at traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as statins, have largely been ineffective. Inflammation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and protein-energy wasting. Biomarkers of the inflammatory state such as       C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are elevated in MHD patients and are also robust predictors of cardiovascular events and mortality in this patient population. While anti-inflammatory interventions, especially specific anti-cytokin therapies have been used successfully to treat patients with inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, and while encouraging studies have been reported in improving glycemic control and beta cell function in type 2 diabetes, there are only limited studies using these interventions in MHD patients.

At 1-year intervals, participants will receive a new supply of pills and a follow up questionnaire on compliance, side effects, and incidence of health endpoints. We propose to ascertain prevalent (pre-randomization) and incident (post-randomization) DED endpoints in the VITAL trail. The primary Specific Aims of VITAL-DED are to test whether omega-3 FA supplementation: 1) reduces the incidence of DED, 2) improves the natural history of DED by relieving symptoms and other impacts on quality of life. Secondary Aims will estimate the incidence of DED in the US, prospectively examine the natural history of DED, explore factors that could modify or influence the impact of omega-3 FA supplementation, evaluate the inter-relationship of DED and depression, and test for possible independent or joint effects of vitamin D3 supplementation in the incidence and natural history of DED. This research is responsive to a program priority of the National Eye Institute's Strategic Plan to improve our understanding of and develop preventive strategies for inflammatory corneal and ocular surface diseases; and also addresses several issues identified in the recent 2010 NEI Workshop on Ocular Pain and Sensitivity. The hypotheses are supported by a compelling biological rationale and strong preliminary data from our prior epidemiological studies, as well as from laboratory investigations and small randomized trials, which suggest that omega-3 FA supplementation, could prevent DED and improve its natural history. We believe the timely start of VITAL-DED offers a unique but time-sensitive opportunity to obtain a reliable, efficient, and informative evaluation of the efficacy of the most promising preventive agent for DED. Given our success with prior large simple trials, our experience with DED, and our proposed methodology, we think VITAL-DED will provide definitive results to guide public health and clinical recommendations for DED prevention and management.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to accelerate the identification and availability of a safe and effective strategy to prevent dry eye disease (DED) and improve its natural history. This is important because DED is very common among older Americans, causing chronic ocular pain, an increased risk of infection, and problems with activities such as reading and driving. Existing evidence points to omega-3 fatty acids as the most promising agent to test for DED prevention and therapy, and we will take advantage of the incomparable opportunity offered by the VITAL trial (VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL), a large randomized trial of 20,000 older men and women to evaluate whether a supplement of omega-3 fatty acids versus a placebo can prevent DED and improve people's quality of life.",

Diet is an important risk factor for CRC and dietary constituents are modified by gut microbial action. Microbial fermentation of dietary fiber and plant lignans in high-fiber foods produces bioactive endproducts, such as butyrate and enterolignans. The enterolignans, enterolactone (ENL) and enterodiol (END) have been associated with lower CRC in some epidemiologic studies. Lignans and dietary fiber have been shown to reduce colon tumors in animal models and butyrate and END and ENL influence cellular pathways important to cancer risk in vitro.   We propose a 3-period randomized, cross-over intervention in 70 healthy men and women (ages 20-45)  with the goal to test the effect of a flaxseed lignan supplement and defatted flaxseed meal (containing  lignans + dietary fiber) as compared to placebo on: 1) host gene expression in epithelial and stromal cells  from colon biopsies and exfoliated colonocytes extracted from feces; 2) gut microbial community  composition, and 3) the interaction of the gut microbiome, enterolignan exposure, and colonic gene  expression in high- and low-ENL excreters. Colon biopsies, stool, and urine will be collected at the end of each of the three 60-day periods to evaluate effects of the lignan treatments. We will use an innovative application of RNA-seq to measure gene expression in human colon cells from biopsy and stool. The gut microbiome will be characterized using pyrosequencing and QPCR of the 16S rRNA gene. Lignans will be measured in urine by GC-MS. Further, using samples from a subset of intervention participants who are low-and high-ENL excreters, we will measure the functional metagenomics of the gut microbiome in vitro.   This proposed project will be the first to integrate and characterize, through a unique interdisciplinary collaboration, the relationships between lignan exposure, gut microbial ecology, and gene expression in cell- signaling pathways. Results of this placebo-controlled intervention will bridge the current knowledge from pre-clinical animal models and epidemiologic studies and will help to inform approaches for CRC prevention.","RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Intake of foods high in dietary fiber is associated with lower risk of colorectal cancer. Gut bacteria convert  constituents of plant foods, sugh as lignans and dietary flber, to biologically active compounds that in animal  models prevent the development of colon cancer. In a human dietary intervention, we will study how these  biologically active compounds affect colon cell-signaling pathways important to colorectal cancer risk.",

Obese children (BMI 95th percentile) and overweight children (BMI 85th-94th percentile) exhibit CVD risk factors and a relatively high prevalence of hypovitaminosis D, and their atherogenic risks track from childhood to adulthood. Therefore, vitamin D replenishment in vitamin D-deficient obese and overweight children has the potential to improve their cardiometabolic health and reduce their risk of CVD later in life. In this proposa, we will test the central hypothesis that enhancement of vitamin D status in such children will improve their vascular health and their CVD and metabolic syndrome risk profile. Our primary objective is to determine, in obese and overweight children aged 10 to 18 years with vitamin D deficiency (defined as serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <20 ng/mL), the efficacy of enhanced vitamin D3 supplementation in improving vascular endothelial function, arterial stiffness, insulin sensitivity, and metabolic syndrome risk status; and to assess whether these effects are dose- dependent. As a secondary objective, we will examine the vitamin D supplementation-induced effect on adipokines and inflammatory markers relevant to CVD risk. In a double-masked, controlled trial, we will randomize 252 eligible children to receive either 600 IU (conventional supplementation), or 1000 IU or 2000 IU (enhanced supplementation) of vitamin D3 daily for 6 months. Study outcome measures, assessed at baseline, 3 and 6 months, will include (1) brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) as a measure of vascular endothelial function; (2) pulse wave velocity as a measure of arterial stiffness; (3) surrogate estimates of insulin sensitivity (fasting glucose/fasting insulin ratio or Homeostasis Model of Assessment - Insulin Resistance [HOMA-IR]); (4) metabolic syndrome risk factors (blood pressure, waist circumference, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and fasting blood glucose); (5) inflammatory markers (e.g. CRP, IL-6, TNF-alpha); (6) adipokines (leptin and adiponectin); and (7) nitric oxide metabolites. Brachial FMD at 6 months will be the primary outcome measure. We will assess the safety of enhanced vitamin D3 supplementation by measuring serum calcium at the 3- and 6-month-follow-ups. Total body fat will be ascertained by Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry to examine the confounding effects of adiposity on outcome measures. Innovative aspects of this proposal include (1) characterizing the temporal changes in vascular health and cardiometabolic risk outcomes in response to enhancement of vitamin D status in a population of children at high-risk for vascular dysfunction and cardiometabolic risks; and (2) delineating the vitamin D effects on inflammatory markers and adipokines relevant to CVD risk. Establishing the protective benefits of vitamin D would have major public health importance, since optimization of vitamin D status would be an inexpensive primary prevention strategy for improving cardiometabolic health during childhood and for reducing CVD risk during adulthood.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal is relevant to public health because demonstrating the cardiovascular and metabolic benefits of vitamin D status enhancement could have significant public health impact - as vitamin D status optimization could be implemented as an inexpensive primary prevention strategy for improving cardiovascular health.",

Asthma often coexists with COPD in adults and worsens COPD progression. The current modalities for treatment of COPD are limited, and prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is high. COPD lung disease (COPD, asthma, airflow obstruction), and most COPD additional co-morbidities responsible for COPD progression (e.g., respiratory infections/pneumonia, muscle weakness, cardiac failure) may benefit from vitamin D supplementation therapy but this requires rigorous testing. Marine omega-3 fatty acids work through different pathways from vitamin D to modulate inflammation. We have carefully evaluated the dose of each of these supplements to achieve the best balance of efficacy and safety. Observational studies and clinical trials suggest that fish consumption and EPA or DHA may protect against COPD, asthma or pneumonia, but data are not consistent. Thus there is a compelling rationale for a clinical trial to evaluate the potential benefits or risks of vitamin D and marine omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on COPD and asthma exacerbations, airflow obstruction and decline of lung function, and risk of pneumonia. We propose to take advantage of a large-scale randomized clinical trial-the VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL), whose endpoints are primary prevention of cancer and cardiovascular diseases-to conduct the first major evaluation of the role of vitamin D and long-chain marine omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] plus docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) supplementation on obstructive and infectious respiratory disease outcomes. VITAL is a cost-effective, randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled clinical trial among 20,000 men and women without cancer or CVD at baseline, who are selected on age only (men aged e60 and women aged e65), with an oversampling of blacks. In a 2x2 factorial design, participants will be randomized to moderate-to-high dose vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol; 1600 IU [40 5g]/d) and fish oil (EPA [500 mg/d] + DHA [500 mg/d]) supplements (or placebos) independently. We hypothesize that Vitamin D3 and marine omega-3 fatty acid (EPA+DHA) supplementation will result in reduction of COPD and asthma exacerbations; in reduction in decline of lung function; in improvement of airway obstruction and asthma control; and in reduction of pneumonia in adults.  To test our Lung VITAL hypotheses it is essential to complete pre-randomization assessment of baseline respiratory symptom status, COPD and asthma exacerbations in the past year; asthma control and use of controller and rescue medication; pulmonary function; and baseline vitamin D and fatty acid levels. Thus it is critically important that this ancillary study be undertaken in parallel to the enrollment period for the parent VITAL trial (Appendix B), which is scheduled to begin in January 2010.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) and pneumonia are leading causes of death in United States and world-wide. COPD, which is also a significant source of disability, is increasing in prevalence. Approximately 14 million adults have asthma, which leads to approximately 12 million missed work days per year in the United States. In adults, COPD and asthma often coexist. If vitamin D or marine omega-3 fatty acid supplementation reduce COPD and asthma exacerbations, reduce decline of lung function, improve asthma control and/or reduce pneumonia risk, this would be of great benefit to public health.",

Folic acid appears to protect against ASD especially in mothers and children who are genetically susceptible to inefficient folate-dependent one-carbon and methylation metabolism, but this finding needs replication. In addition to being essential for neurodevelopment, folate is a primary methyl-donor for methylation reactions, including DNA methylation. The time near conception is an especially critical period for adequate methyl supply during cycles of active demethylation and re-methylation of the genome during embryogenesis. Our preliminary data show that folic acid supplementation is associated with even greater reductions in ASD risk, by 75%, in younger siblings of children with ASD. In addition, we found DNA methylation differences associated with no maternal use of folic acid supplements in birth tissues (placenta and cord blood) for genes with nuclear regulatory and brain development functions that could have implications for ASD.  The goal of the proposed work is to leverage data and samples from mother-child pairs in two large prospective pregnancy cohorts of high-risk infant siblings to examine specific pathways for prevention of ASD through maternal dietary and supplemental folate intake. This work will build on previous studies by examining exposures collected prospectively, with more accuracy in terms of timing and dose. We will be first to examine whether other methyl-donor B-vitamins have associated effects. We will include information on dietary and supplemental folate and B-vitamin intake from validated instruments, and measurements from maternal first trimester serum, cord blood, and fetal placental tissue. We will examine folic acid interactions with genetic  susceptibility factors. Finally, we will increase understanding of the underlying mechanisms by identifying DNA methylation changes associated with folate status, and investigate whether these changes overlap with methylation patterns observed in autistic brains, using innovative methods, multiple platforms, and replication across tissue type and study population, to address challenges associated with DNA methylation measurement. Through completion of the proposed project, we will gain a better understanding of how strongly folic acid is associated with reduced risk of ASD in high-risk families, when intake is most associated and at what levels, how this association differs based on genetic susceptibility, and whether maternal folic acid intake alters DNA methylation profiles in ways that could decrease ASD risk.

Individual variation in metabolism is critical to consider when interpreting associations between dietary exposures and subsequent disease risk, and may partly explain inconsistencies in studies of diet and breast cancer. In fact, accumulating evidence supports the hypothesis that the effect of a dietary component, e.g. lignans, may be expressed differentially for individuals possessing specific variation in genes involved either in the metabolism of the dietary component and/or that of the non-dietary metabolic target. Also, to become physiologically active, plant lignans require transformation by the mammalian gut bacteria. These bacteria are numerous, diverse, and essential to the metabolism of dietary components; thus, gut bacterial composition is becoming a target for examination as an important contributor to and modifier of dietary exposures. Finally, race may also be an important effect modifier, as the concept of race incorporates genetic diversity, microbial diversity, and lifestyle factors including diet. The objective in the present study is to determine how variation in gut microbial community composition and in steroid hormone and xenobiotic metabolizing genes affects the metabolism of mammalian lignans and steroid hormones at baseline and after exposure to a lignan-rich food (flaxseed), and how these associations differ for African American and Caucasian women. Humans are, in fact, superorganisms with a diverse genetic background that is augmented by diverse and metabolically active bacterial communities, the composition of which can be modified by specific dietary exposures. Our central hypothesis is that the metabolic response to a dietary component results from the combined effects of an individual's genetic makeup and the particular composition of that individual's gut bacterial communities. Elucidation of interactions between the gut microbiome, host genetics, and diet will have a positive impact on development of improved targeted dietary interventions to reduce cancer risk.","Previous studies of diet and cancer have often produced inconsistent results, possibly because an individual's response to dietary exposures might be determined by their individual differences in metabolism.

This career training award would allow her to pursue formal training through a Master's degree in Clinical and Translational Research, with a focus on designing interventions and conducting clinical trials to improve maternal and neonatal outcomes in obese pregnancy. She will benefit from the experience of an expert mentoring team. Her primary mentor will be Dr. Simin Meydani, Professor of Nutrition and Immunology at Tufts University and a renowned expert in micronutrient intervention studies. Her co-mentors will be Dr. Marlene Goldman, an expert in antioxidant interventions and reproductive health, Dr. David Greenblatt, an expert in pharmacologic interventions and obesity and Dr. Norma Terrin, an expert in clinical trial design.

The proposed research project, 'BMI-based prenatal vitamins to ameliorate oxidative stress in obese pregnancy,' is a novel intervention aimed at decreasing oxidative stress and inflammation, key abnormalities in the intrauterine milieu of obese pregnancy. Dr. Sen previously identified the importance of oxidative stress in the causative pathway of intergenerational obesity in an animal model, and her pilot data shows that oxidative stress is markedly increased, and anti-oxidant defenses markedly depleted, in obese pregnant women. This trial is a logical extension of this previous work. Her central hypothesis is that obese pregnancy is characterized by an oxidant/anti-oxidant imbalance, which increases inflammation and adversely impacts maternal health and neonatal outcome. Restoring oxidant/anti-oxidant balance with a body mass index-based prenatal micronutrient supplement will decrease oxidative stress and inflammation and improve both maternal and neonatal outcomes in obese pregnancy. This hypothesis will be tested in a randomized controlled trial in obese pregnant women. Given its overwhelming current and future impact, innovative approaches to diminish the effect of maternal obesity on future generations are of paramount public health importance.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: One out of three pregnant women is obese, predisposing the next generation to obesity and metabolic dysregulation.

Our previous work has revealed a new immunologic paradigm which underscores the importance of adequate circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25D) levels for human host defense against microbial infection. We demonstrated that in human macrophages: innate and adaptive mechanisms activate different receptors but converge on a common vitamin D receptor (VDR)-driven antimicrobial pathway against M. tuberculosis (mTB) involving the induction of IL-15 and the the vitamin D-1�-hydroxylase (CYP27b1), which converts 25D to the active metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D). Subsequent activation of the VDR induces downstream genes coding for the antimicrobial peptides cathelicidin and DEFB4, together with induction of autophagy, result in antimicrobial activity. Strikingly, this antimicrobial pathway was dependent on levels of 25D, which also correlate with susceptibility to tuberculosis in humans. Our central hypothesis is that adequate circulating 25D levels are critically required for effective innate and adaptive immune responses against mTB, which we will test according to the following specific aims: 1) define the distinct and interactive roles of IL-15 and IL-32 in the induction of the 25D-dependent antimicrobial pathway, 2) investigate counter-regulation of antimicrobial activity by Type I IFNs; and 3) determine the effects of 25D availability on dendritic cell (DC) function.

While vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids have been hypothesized to be protective dietary factors for T1D, the evidence supporting their role is either contradictory or lacking. Many nutrition epidemiology studies rely on self-reported dietary intake information, which can be subjective and inaccurate, making it difficult to understand the role of diet in disease development. There exists a critical need for independent assessment of dietary intake via metabolomics profiling and for reliable predictors that connect nutrient metabolism with the etiology of the disease process. Metabolomic profiling can be used as an independent marker of dietary intake and metabolism within the body. T1D is a complex chronic disease, with multiple genetic and environmental risk factors influencing critical time-points in the disease's natural history; therefore, it is necessary to combine prospectively-collected dietary data with dietary biomarkers, metabolites, genetic variants, DNA methylation and gene expression data in order to more fully understand the pathways involved. For example, it is not known whether omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D interact with genetic variants (nutrigenetics), or whether they alter gene expression, via epigenomic changes (nutrigenomics), to reduce risk for islet autoimmunity (IA), the pre-clinical phase that precedes T1D, and T1D itself. The Diabetes Autoimmunity Study in the Young (DAISY) cohort of 2,547 children at increased T1D risk has made substantial progress in elucidating the nutritional etiology of IA and T1D, although this has highlighted the complexities of the relationships and limitations of the tools of associational epidemiology. We propose to conduct a nested case-control study using the prospectively collected data in DAISY. The overall aim of the study is to elucidate the nutrition epidemiological findings regarding vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids and risk of IA and T1D using cutting-edge metabolomics, nutrigenetic and nutrigenomics techniques. We propose to further explore the nutrition epidemiology of T1D by supplementing existing nutrition and biomarker data with vitamin D binding protein (in order to calculate free 25[OH]D), and metabolites related to vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid pathways, in order to obtain an assessment of intake and nutrient metabolism, independent of self-reported intake. We will then explore the nutrigenetics of T1D by examining whether the effect of vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids on IA and T1D differs by genetic variation. Finally, we will explore the nutrigenomics of T1D by investigating whether vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid intake alter gene expression, via epigenetic changes, to influence predisposition to T1D. There are significant gaps in understanding the biologic mechanisms underlying the association between vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids and the development of IA and T1D. Elucidating these mechanisms is critical for the development of prevention and treatment strategies aimed at reducing the burden of T1D.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) affects 1.4 million people in the U.S. and its incidence has doubled over the past 20 years.

Vitamin D can influence the regulation of genes responsible for metabolism and transport processes that mediate xenobiotic clearance. This is highly relevant since vitamin D treatment is common, as deficiency (total 25(OH)D level <30 ng/mL) is observed in up to 90% of CKD cohorts. Previous published research by the Principal Investigators and others has shown that renal and nonrenal xenobiotic clearance pathways mediated by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and transporters is altered in CKD. Given the 24 M US citizens with CKD are prescribed an average of 10-12 different medications daily, the clinical realities of altered xenobiotic clearance in CKD (drug interactions, side effects, altered efficacy, and confusion for clinicians prescribing and/or monitoring treatments) are not trivial. Importantly, increasing evidence indicates that vitamin D deficiency is a significant non-traditional cardiovascular risk factor, and vitamin D is important or bone and musculoskeletal health, kidney protection, cancer prevention, and decreased severity or risk of autoimmune and infectious diseases. In this proposal, we developed a translational study employing in vivo and in vitro studies to investigate how vitamin D alters the activity of drug metabolism and transport pathways in CKD. We propose to characterize the in vivo activity of xenobiotic metabolism and transport pathways in CKD patients and healthy controls under the opposing influences of vitamin D deficiency and repletion. Moreover, physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models will explore mechanisms for vitamin D and uremia on variations in drug metabolism and transport using data derived from the planned in vivo and in vitro studies. Our central hypothesis is that vitamin D status independently affects metabolism and transport function in CKD patients. An over-arching goal of this proposal is to make drug therapies safer and more effective to reduce the significant morbidity and mortality in patients with CKD. Three independent Specific Aims comprised of in vivo and in vitro studies were formulated to address the key hypotheses: 1) The in vivo function of individual pathways of xenobiotic metabolism and transport are affected by vitamin D status and by CKD, 2) CKD alters the activity of individual CYPs responsible for vitamin D metabolism, leading to modified pharmacokinetics of cholecalciferol, and 3) Vitamin D treatment and simulated CKD differentially alter the expression and function of drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters in kidney and liver cells. These studies will be central to determine where more scrutiny is warranted in evaluating clinical risks for drug interactions, altered efficacy and toxicity of therapies, and for guidance on appropriate vitamin D deficiency and maintenance regimens. Long term benefits of this research are improvements in medication management, drug dosing guidelines, and corresponding outcomes in targeted organs and/or diseases for vitamin D treated patients. The proposed research would have high impact through the public health benefit of improving care provided to CKD patients, serving as a basis for future study of alterations in drug metabolism and transport, and provision of much needed information on vitamin D metabolism and pharmacokinetics in CKD.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patients with chronic kidney disease have alterations in the way the body handles medications.

In addition to collecting questionnaire information, these two Asian cohorts include an established biorepository with blood, buccal and urine samples from more than 50,000 participants. With the vigorous follow-up procedures in place, only 1.5 percent of the original cohort participants have been lost to follow-up. To date, approximately 17 percent of the cohort members were diagnosed with incident cancers; approximately 50 percent of the cancer patients have stored biospecimens. Researches evaluating the unique environmental and lifestyle exposures of the Asian cohort study populations have provided novel findings that contributed to the field of cancer etiology and prevention. These novel findings in part provided the rationale for our current chemoprevention trials in U.S. populations. During the next 5-year study period, we propose to: (1) Conduct core infrastructure activities to maintain and enhance the two Asian cohort databases, including: (a) follow-up for cancer, non-cancer and death outcomes, (b) maintenance of the biorepositories, and (c) management of the databases; (2) Conduct in-person and telephone interviews among cohort participants to update exposure and medical information; (3) Collect blood and urine samples from cohort participants with cancer diagnoses; and (4) Engage in collaborative research projects of the NCI and Asian Consortium Consortia. We anticipate that the established resources of the two Asian cohorts will become even more scientifically valuable over the next five years as the younger members of the cohorts enter into the age of maximal cancer incidence, thereby increasing the number of pre-disease biomarker-based research projects.        RELEVANCE: We are requesting infrastructure support for two established, population-based cancer epidemiology cohorts among Chinese men and women. The unique exposures and cancer risl< profiles of the Asian cohorts have been essential to identifying the protective effect of specific dietary factors on cancer risk. These important findings have been used as a rationale for conducting cancer chemoprevention trials in U.S. populations.","We are requesting infrastructure support for two established, population-based cancer epidemiology cohorts  among Chinese men and women.

Osteoporosis and fractures are major health problems in the U.S. with annual expenditures of $19 billion, and the problem is growing. Our goal is to provide nurses and the wider healthcare community best practice guidelines by contributing evidence as to whether a lifestyle intervention should be implemented for women with low bone mass prior to use of bisphosphonate (BP) medications. In this study, women with low bone mass in the first 5 years of menopause (a time of rapid and significant bone loss) will be randomized to 3 groups (n =103 per group): 1) optimal calcium + vitamin D (optimal CaD) alone (Control); 2) a BP plus optimal CaD (Risedronate); or 3) a three times weekly bone loading exercise program plus optimal CaD (Exercise). Adequate calcium and vitamin D are necessary for bone; however, they frequently are not enough to prevent progression of bone loss in post-menopausal women. Although BPs are indicated for women with osteoporosis, their use is controversial for women with early bone loss. One concern is that long-term use of BPs may increase risk for atypical hip and femur fractures. A bone loading exercise program promotes bone health by improving bone structure and bone formation at sites of mechanical stress as well as by preserving BMD. Comparing effectiveness of exercises with BPs is critical because this will determine whether standard practice should include a trial of exercises prior to BP prescriptions in this at risk population. If an effective exercise program could substitute for, or delay the use of BPs, not only would bone health improve throughout the lifespan, but women would benefit from the many other positive effects of exercise. Our central hypothesis is that after 12 months of participation, improvements in bone strength will be greater in subjects randomized to the Exercise group compared to subjects in either the Control or Risedronate groups. We believe that the best predictor of fracture is bone strength, and strength is determined by bone structure and turnover as well as BMD. Thus, outcomes will include changes in bone structure at the tibia and hip (pQCT and Hip Structural Analysis); BMD at the total hip, femoral neck, and spine; and serum markers of bone formation and resorption. Because adherence to exercises and risedronate may be difficult for subjects to accomplish, education, goal setting, graphic feedback, and targeted strategies for barrier reduction will be used to promote adherence. Dr. Nancy Waltman has over 15 years' experience and 14 publications on the impact of exercise on bone in post-menopausal women. With the addition of Dr. Bilek and other expert consultants and co-investigators, we believe we are well-qualified to conduct this study. Our proposal is consistent with the NINR strategic plan to support research for patient self-management, disease prevention, & application of new technology (Hip Structural Analysis and pQCT).","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Osteoporosis and fractures are major health care problems in postmenopausal women. To prevent fractures and strengthen bones, treatments for low bone mass should improve bone structure and increase bone formation at common sites of fractures as well as maintaining bone mineral density.

This project will leverage the unique resources of the Norwegian Autism Birth Cohort (ABC) and the Center for Infection and Immunity (CII) for insights into the role of infection, immunity and inflammation in autism through pursuit of three complementary aims that address not only immune activation, fever and drug and micronutrient exposures during gestation per se, but also the timing of these phenomena. In Aim 1 we will investigate the relationship of infectious, immune and inflammatory events to ASD risk using prospective questionnaire data about the following exposures in ASD and control mother- child pairs: a) infection; b) presence, timing and duration of fever, c) autoimmune and allergic conditions, d) antipyretics (acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]), analgesics and antibiotics, and e) micronutrients that modify immune function (vitamin D, zinc) or mitigate antibiotic anti-folate effects (folate). In Aim 2 we will define the immune signatures associated with ASD using multiplexed immunoassays (Luminex) to compare levels of 61 immune/inflammatory molecules in plasma samples from ASD and control mothers (mid-gestation, birth) and children (umbilical cord blood).

Reducing AAP linked metabolic risks may help cut the 30 years of life lost within this population. Supplemental folate may be a cost effective and low risk method to reduce AAP CVD morbidity and mortality. Folate pharmacogenetics, allows us to mechanistically study AAP metabolic complications and develop personalized medicine within clinical practice. The objective of this project is to compare the effect of folate versus placebo on measures of the metabolic syndrome and CVD risk factors. We will evaluate metabolic laboratory components, and endothelial functioning, in schizophrenia patients receiving AAPs, taking into account pharmacogenetic differences related to folate metabolism. Our primary hypothesis is that folate will attenuate metabolic changes associated with AAP use, thereby contributing to improve endothelial functioning. Variation within the genes facilitating folate metabolism (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and catechol-o-methyl transferase (COMT)) modulate these improvements. We have formulated this hypothesis based on our pilot data obtained during R01MH082784 showing AAPs increase metabolic syndrome risk due to an interaction with MTHFR and COMT. We performed an open-label 3-month folate supplement trial and found significant reductions in metabolic measures and significantly reduced the number of subjects meeting endothelial dysfunction criteria. These improvements were modulated through MTHFR and COMT. The specific aims for this proposal are: 1) Evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness of folic acid supplementation (5mg/day) versus placebo for 16 weeks in schizophrenia subjects and measure sustainability of this effect 8 weeks after supplementation withdrawal, 2) Determine the role of MTHFR and COMT variants on endothelial functioning and metabolic improvements seen with folate supplementation. The innovative approach capitalizes upon a novel strategy to reduce AAP metabolic risks using a novel non-invasive endothelial functioning measurement as a biomarker. This allows for an overall CVD risk estimation compared to focusing on solely weight loss and glucose regulation. The inclusion of pharmacogenomics allows for potential innovative translation of personalized medicine outcomes into practice. Our expected outcomes will demonstrate folate's effectiveness in attenuating metabolic syndrome measures and improvements in endothelial functioning in AAP users with a randomized double blind longitudinal treatment design. Our follow up visit will allow for measurement of any sustained folate effects leading to future dose ranging studies. Successful completion of our pharmacogenetic analyses can be expected to provide a greater mechanistic understanding of AAP metabolic risks. The primary positive impact of our anticipated findings will be an evidence-based scientific framework for folate intervention development for AAP metabolic complications, which can be directly translated into clinical practice.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health relevance of this proposed research is that its successful completion can be expected to provide a cost effective intervention that can be used to significantly reduce the risk of development of cardiovascular problems for patients taking antipsychotic medications to treat their serious mental illness.

Existing therapies for CKD improve outcomes only modestly. Therapeutic strategies that target novel CKD-specific mechanisms of CVD and CKD progression are desperately needed to improve health. Disordered mineral metabolism is a nearly universal complication of CKD, regardless of its underlying etiology. An elevated level of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is the earliest manifestation of disordered mineral metabolism in CKD. FGF23 rises in response to high phosphate diets and in states of impaired phosphate excretion, such as CKD. Rising FGF23 in CKD maintains normal serum phosphate, but also inhibits renal calcitriol production, which causes secondary hyperparathyroidism, and reduces klotho expression, which accelerates arterial calcification. Elevated FGF23 powerfully predicts ESRD, CVD events and death, and data from our group, validated by new preliminary data, suggest potential underlying pathogenic mechanisms: FGF23 induces left ventricular hypertrophy and accelerates CKD progression, and phosphate excess and klotho deficiency induce arterial calcification independent of FGF23.   Based on these data, FGF23 excess and disordered mineral metabolism are leading candidates to target in an outcomes trial. Our long-term goal is to prove by randomized trial that treatment of FGF23 excess and disordered mineral metabolism with phosphate binders, dietary phosphate manipulation, and active vitamin D, will reduce risks of ESRD, CVD events and death in CKD stages 3-4. In this Clinical Center application, we propose two pilot studies to fill remaining knowledge gaps that will inform the design of an outcomes trial. In Pilot Study 1, we will conduct a 6-month, randomized, 3 x 2 study of 150 CKD stage 3-4 patients of lanthanum versus sevelamer versus. placebo, alone and combined with dietary phosphate manipulation to compare their effects on FGF23, phosphate and other mineral metabolites. The results will define which binder should be advanced to an outcomes trial, and whether it should be accompanied by a dietary intervention. In Pilot Study 2, we will conduct a 12-month, randomized, 2 x 2 study of the 'winning' phosphate binder + diet arm in Pilot Study 1 versus placebo, and calcitriol vs. placebo in 220 CKD stage 3-4 patients to test the hypothesis that combining active  therapies will synergistically improve surrogate markers of CVD and renal risk. A decade of work in the field and extensive preliminary data support our hypotheses. Our team has the requisite clinical research expertise in FGF23 and vitamin D to complete these studies. The University of Miami has a track record of recruiting minority participants in multi-center trials, which is critical in diseases that disproportionately affect minorities, such as CKD.  Backed by a strong institutional environment energized by a new CTSA award, our participation in the U01 Consortium will enrich the diversity of study populations it recruits and allow us to contribute to the collaborative effort aimed at improving dismal clinical outcomes suffered by millions of patients with CKD.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  A high circulating level of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is the earliest manifestation of disordered bone  and mineral metabolism in chronic kidney disease, and it is a powerful risk factor for kidney failure,  cardiovascular disease and death.

Despite food fortification and dietary supplementation, vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency is still relativly common in the US. Many epidemiologic studies consistently found that low vitamin D status was associated with increased risks of non-skeletal chronic diseases including colorectal cancer (CRC). However, randomized clinical trials generated inconsistent results. One striking observation is that a large portion of the inter-person variation in serum 25- hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels is unexplained. Further, there is a substantial inter-individual variation in serum 25(OH)D in response to the same dose of vitamin D supplementation. Mg plays a critical role in the synthesis and metabolism of vitamin D. The activities of 3 key enzymes determining 25(OH)D level may be Mg-dependent. Further, Mg deficiency has been implicated in 'Mg-dependent vitamin-D-resistant rickets' and Mg supplementation substantially reversed resistance to vitamin D treatment. Very recently, we found intake of Mg significantly interacted with intake of vitamin D in relation to risks of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency. Furthermore, we found the associations of serum 25(OH)D with mortality, including mortality due to CRC, may be modified by Mg intake, and the reduction in risk associated with high serum concentrations of 25(OH)D appeared primarily among those with Mg intake e median. Our novel finding of Mg-vitamin D interaction may explain some of the variability in 25(OH)D levels and may provide another possible interpretation to explain previous inconsistencies. Very recently, an animal study found the Mg-deficient diet significantly reduced the mRNA of the enzyme that primarily converts 25(OH)D to its active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)D), and significantly increased mRNA expression of the enzyme which mainly converts 25(OH)D to 24,25- dihydroxyvitamin D (24,25(OH)D). Further, a randomized clinical trial of vitamin D supplementation observed changes in vitamin D metabolite conversion with a significant increase in conversion of 25(OH)D to 24,25(OH)D. However, the ratio of serum 24,25(OH)D to serum 25(OH)D was only temporarily and slightly affected by vitamin D supplementation. Furthermore, the initial ratio predicted the efficacy of vitamin D treatment (i.e. rise in 25(OH)D). Based on these findings, we hypothesize that Mg supplementation reduces 24,25(OH)D and the ratio of 24,25(OH)D/ 25(OH)D (two markers of Mg deficiency), and, thus, improves resistance to vitamin D and reduces risk of CRC. To test hypothesis, we propose to measure serum levels of 24,25(OH)D, 25(OH)D, and 1,25 (OH)D in samples collected prior to and at the conclusion of a 12-week Mg intervention in 180 individuals (90 Mg-treatment and 90 placebo). This study will be the first to evaluate the effect of Mg supplementation on resistance to vitamin D and will lay the foundation for future prevention trials.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will investigate the effect of magnesium treatment on change in vitamin D metabolite levels and ratio. This study is very critical to understand whether vitamin D metabolism and vitamin D resistance (i.e. insensitivity to vitamin D supplementation) can be improved by magnesium supplementation and to translate it into a preventive strategy for colorectal cancer and, possibly, other cancers. Thus, the proposed study has profound public health and clinical implications.",

Low-grade chronic inflammation is a modifiable risk factor. However, it is unknown whether interventions that reduce the levels of inflammatory markers per se improve mobility, or avert decline in mobility in older persons.  To address this gap in evidence we propose the randomized clinical trial ENRGISE (ENabling Reduction of low-Grade Inflammation in SEniors) to test the ability of anti-inflammatory interventions for preventing major mobility disability by improving or preserving walking ability. We have maximized the public health impact of our proposed interventions by selecting interventions that are safe, tolerable, acceptable, and affordable for vulnerable older persons. Based on an extensive literature review, we propose to test the efficacy vs. placebo of the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in the form of fish oil, alone and in combination. Both angiotensin receptor blockers and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have shown to reduce IL-6 in clinical trials and preliminary data suggest that they may improve physical function.  We plan to recruit older persons who are at risk for, or with, mobility impairment, as measured by slow gait speed and self-reported mobility difficulty, and who have elevated levels of IL-6, the marker most consistently associated with mobility limitations. Preliminary data regarding feasibility need to be gathered before such a tria can be effectively designed and implemented. We propose to conduct a feasibility phase that includes performing meta-analyses of existing trials and cohorts, and conducting a pilot trial to assess the effects of the interventions on several inflammatory markers and walking speed. This will allow us to refine the design, recruitment yields, target population, adherence, retention, tolerability, sample-size, and cost for the main ENRGISE trial.

Despite the profound public health burden, there have been no clinical trials that have attempted to directly address the neurodevelopmental deficits that are so debilitating in FASD. Extensive pre- clinical work (Thomas et al. and others) has provided evidence that choline supplementation is effective in attenuating the neurodevelopmental deficits caused by prenatal alcohol exposure in animal models. Our group has taken the initial steps toward translating this work to humans with two randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled trials. We first conducted a pilot study to ensure the feasibility, tolerability, and safety of choline supplementation in 20 children with FASD (Fuglestad et al, 2013). Next, we completed a study of 40 additional participants with the goals of establishing a target dosage for young children, testing efficacy in the domain of memory, and determining a developmental window for choline's effects (detailed in `preliminary studies').  Briefly, our pilot data revealed that: 1. Children wih FASD consume insufficient dietary choline on average; 2. Choline supplementation was safe, tolerable and feasible for 2-5 year olds; 3. Supplementation for 9 months increased children's explicit memory performance relative to placebo; 4. Significant memory improvement was seen in 2-3 year olds but not 4-5 year olds. For 2-3 year olds, memory improvement was 21 percentage points in the choline arm compared to 2 percentage points in the placebo arm; 5. A dose ranging from 10-19 mg/kg was associated with the largest improvement in memory; 6. A very common single- nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs12325817), related to endogenous choline production, appears to moderate the efficacy of choline for children with FASD.  These findings directly inform the next study. Aim 1 involves evaluating a 19 mg/kg dose in 60 children with FASD, ages 2 to 5. This dosing scheme will optimize the neurocognitive benefits and further enhance tolerability of the intervention. In addition to continuing the evaluation of memory benefits from choline, Aim 2 adds measures of attention and executive function as possible additional targets. The NIH Toolbox Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test and the Executive Function Scale for Early Childhood (pilot-tested during our last study) have been added. Aim 3 adds a longitudinal component - it will evaluate 40 children in the period two years after treatment to determine the permanency of choline's effects. Lastly, Aim 4 will further examine the role of known SNPs in choline synthesis as moderators to the observed treatment effects.  In summary, the proposed study will continue the translation of choline's application - from experimental pre-clinical work to an evidence-based intervention for neurodevelopmental deficits in children with FASD.          ","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is known to contribute to permanent brain damage in the child, yet there are no established treatments. We completed the first two studies of choline supplementation in human children: a feasibility study and a pilot  efficacy study. The proposed study will continue that work, determining whether choline supplementation during a specific developmental window when the child's brain remains somewhat plastic is able to attenuate the deficits in thinking, memory, processing speed, and behavior that are common in children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and whether these changes are long- lasting.

No pharmacologic therapies reliably prevent or treat AKI. Novel therapeutic targets for clinical intervention are therefore needed.  Vitamin D metabolites have important and potentially beneficial antiinflammatory effects which prevent AKI in animal models. Since vitamin D metabolites are often decreased in critical illness, we propose that deficiencies in the vitamin D axis may be risk factors for incident AKI, and that exogenous vitamin D metabolites may be novel therapeutic agents for AKI prevention. Our preliminary data support these hypotheses. We showed that patients with established AKI have decreased levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25D) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D) in association with elevated fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) levels; the latter is known to suppress both renal and extra-renal conversion of 25D to 1,25D. In further preliminary data, we recently published the results of a pilot RCT demonstrating that administration of a single 2 µg IV dose of 1,25D to critically il patients increases leukocyte mRNA expression of interleukin-10 (IL-10) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). These important antiinflammatory proteins prevent AKI in animal models.  In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will leverage an established ICU cohort to perform the first comprehensive, prospective study to investigate whether 25D, 1,25D, and FGF23 are independent risk factors for adverse renal outcomes among 200 critically ill patients with a high AKI event rate. Primary outcomes will include: incident AKI, assessed by serum creatinine; renal tubular injury, assessed by urinary NGAL and KIM- 1; and need for renal replacement therapy or death. In Aim 2 we will enroll 150 critically ill patients at risk of AKI into a three-arm, double-blind, randomied study of 25D, 1,25D, or placebo to test the effects of repeated doses of vitamin D metabolites on renal and immunomodulatory endpoints. We will test whether 25D and/or 1,25D attenuate incident kidney injury, assessed by time averaged levels of both serum creatinine and urinary NGAL and KIM-1. Further, we will test whether 25D and/or 1,25D increase monocyte mRNA expression of antiinflammatory targets IL-10, HO-1, HIF1a, and thrombomodulin, decrease monocyte mRNA expression of proinflammatory targets ICAM-1 and IL-6, and increase T regulatory (Treg) %, all of which attenuate kidney injury in animal models. Additionally, we will evaluate physiologic endpoints including plasma levels of FGF23 and monocyte mRNA expression of 1-a hydroxylase and 24-hydroxylase to elucidate whether peripheral conversion of 25D to 1,25D is impaired in critical illness.  By unifying a comprehensive, prospective clinical outcomes study and an innovative trial under one thematic umbrella, we will generate novel, clinically relevant insights into the emerging role of vitamin D metabolites in critical illness an AKI that could have important diagnostic and therapeutic implications.     ","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Acute kidney injury is a devastating complication of critical illness.

The parent UM-1 is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center, Phase II clinical trial examining the efficacy  of high dose intravenous vitamin C (VitC, ascorbic acid) infusion for 96 hours in human sepsis-associated acute lung injury.      The proposed ancillary study will examine the effects of parenteral VitC on sepsis-associated coagulopathy and platelet dysfunction (which is not being evaluated in the parent UM-1). Sepsis provokes intense systemic pro-inflammatory and pro-coagulant responses that arise from dysregulation of host-derived mediators of inflammation and coagulation. As a result, sepsis-driven coagulation induces consumption of coagulation and fibrinolytic factors that lead to Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC), one of the most feared complications of sepsis that leads to widespread systemic microvascular thrombosis. DIC is a critical mediator of sepsis-associated multiple organ failure. The long range goal of our research team is to develop optimal strategies to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with human sepsis, specifically targeting the attenuation of DIC and other thrombotic events that lead to end-organ dysfunction. We have preliminary data suggesting Vitamin C significantly attenuates the inflammatory and pro-coagulant cascades in both animal and human sepsis. The Central Hypothesis is that parenteral VitC reduces sepsis-associated coagulopathy in humans by restoration of hemostatic integrity, and by the normalization of platelet function. We believe the molecular basis by which this occurs is through mechanisms attenuating increases in circulating pro-inflammatory mediators (which are being measured in the parent UM-1 study). The rationale is that if Vitamin C attenuates the inflammatory and coagulation pathways in sepsis, the occurrence of end-organ dysfunction can be reduced thereby improving morbidity and mortality. The specific aims will: (1) Determine the effects of parenteral vitamin C on plasma coagulation biomarkers in patients with severe sepsis; (2) Characterize the effect of parenteral vitamin C on platelet function in patients with severe sepsis; and (3) Determine the relationships between Vit C, persistent hypercoagulability, and DIC score in the CITRIS-ALI study. Finally, consistent with the R-15 mechanism, this study will provide pharmacy- and graduate students hands-on experience in clinical and translational research.          ","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patients with sepsis have unacceptably high mortality rates as a result of systemic clotting throughout the body. We hypothesize that intravenous Vitamin C will prevent the dysregulation of the clotting processes. Should our hypothesis be confirmed, this could revolutionize treatment strategies in sepsis utilizing an inexpensive, cost-effective parenteral vitamin C supplement.               ",

In recent meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials in humans, daily aspirin use reduced incidence, metastasis and mortality from several common types of cancer, especially colorectal cancer. The mechanism(s) by which aspirin exerts an anticancer benefit is uncertain; numerous effects have been described involving both cyclooxygenase-dependent and -independent pathways. The goal of this research is to elucidate the key metabolic changes that are responsible for the anticancer effects of aspirin in humans using untargeted metabolomics analysis. Metabolomics, or global metabolite profiling, is an emerging discipline that has the potential to transform the study of pharmaceutical agents. Our innovative approach will use high-resolution mass spectroscopy to detect thousands of metabolites in blood plasma and normal colon mucosa biopsies that were collected from participants in the Aspirin/Folate Polyp Prevention Study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of aspirin and/or folic acid  supplementation for the prevention of colorectal adenomas. Participants in the trial were assigned with equal probability to three aspirin treatment arms (placebo, 81 mg, or 325 mg daily). Over the three-year treatment period, 81 mg/day of aspirin reduced the risk of adenomas, whereas the 325 mg/day dose had less effect. The aims of the current proposal are to identify metabolomic signatures, including specific metabolites and metabolic pathways, that are associated with aspirin treatment in blood and normal colon mucosal tissue of participants after three years of randomized aspirin treatment; and then to assess the associations of these metabolic signatures with adenoma risk and whether they mediate the reductions in risk due to 81 mg/day aspirin treatment. We will prioritize metabolites for study by evaluating metabolite levels in patients from the placebo and treatment arms while controlling the false discovery rate, use correlation analysis to enhance identification of relevant metabolic modules associated with these prioritized metabolites, and apply pathway mapping with post-hoc application of ion dissociation spectroscopy to representative metabolites to confirm pathway identification. Because aspirin is a multifunctional drug that is thought to modify numerous pathways with potential roles in carcinogenesis, a global discovery-based metabolomics approach is the best way to identify its key activities. The public health significance of this work is substantial because understanding the mechanism of aspirin's anticancer effects is key to optimizing its use and to the development of novel drugs targeting the metabolic pathways identified.

Neural tube defects (NTDs) are among the most common and serious of all birth defects affecting 0.5-1 per 1,000 US newborns, yet their complex etiology remains poorly understood (Wallingford et al., 2013). It is well established that pre-pregnancy supplementation with folic acid can reduce the risk of NTDs, but the underlying mechanism of this beneficial effect is unclear. Approximately 30% of NTDs cannot be prevented by maternal periconceptional folate supplementation. Our preliminary data showed that rare mutations in planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway could increase the risk of NTDs, while mutagens such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were enriched in the placentas of NTDs fetuses/infants. We hypothesized that NTDs are caused by combinations of rare multiple mutations. Higher mutation rates results in a higher NTDs prevalence. It is possible that folic acid can prevent NTDs by reducing the mutation rate. Furthermore, we hypothesize that paternal supplementation with folic acid can further reduce NTD rates. We have a unique opportunity to evaluate folate supplement effect on mutation rate by leveraging previously collected biological samples from NTD patients and controls from several distinct cohorts. Additionally, we propose to use mouse models to better understand the relationship between folate and mutation rates in vivo. The results of this study will provide an explanation of how folate prevents NTDs, and will reveal novel pathways for intervention on folate-resistant NTDs. Hence, the successful completion of the proposed studies is likely to have substantial impact on our understanding of conditions that affect ~6% of births worldwide and constitute one of the major healthcare concerns for the youngest members of society.          ","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Folic acid supplementation has proven to be an effective intervention in the prevention of neural tube defects (NTDs).

We hypothesize that folic acid reduces the mutation rates, thereby limiting combinations of rare mutations that have been associated with increase NTD risks. We believe that paternal supplementation with folic acid can further reduce NTD prevalence. These hypotheses will be tested in human NTD samples as well as in newly developed mouse model systems.               ",

In the US, close to 48 million people contract AGE and 128,000 are hospitalized each year . Episodes of AGE can result in substantial morbidity to children and their families. In addition, the costs to caregivers, the health-care system, and society are significant. At present, treatment options are limited and targeted at symptom management rather than disease modification. Probiotics - live microbial cultures which, when consumed in adequate amounts, confer documented health benefits - may be an ideal solution. They are hypothesized to work via a combination of direct microbiologic and immunologic mechanisms. Probiotics have shown promise in early clinical research in hospitalized children in developing countries. These early efforts are limited by small samples, outcomes lacking relevance to outpatients, poor methodology and absence of side effect reporting; thus, the potential role of probiotics remains poorly defined and practice guidelines do not endorse their use. There are current trends, however, that obligate an urgent assessment of these agents. First, probiotic manufacturers have embarked in aggressive public marketing strategies that make health claims that may not be supported by rigorous research, and the world-wide market for probiotic products is growing steadily (projected growth 2009-2014 12.6% for a total of US $32.6 billion/year). Second, government agencies (US FDA and European Food safety Authority (EFSA)) remain concerned about their value and safety. Third, some institutions are now recommending the use of probiotics based on potentially flawed or limited evidence. Fourth, parents of patients with AGE are often medicating their children without guidance from medical professionals. We are therefore concerned that probiotic consumption is increasing without solid evidence to support its use, which underscores the necessity to conduct a definitive trial without delay. Objectives - The overall objective of this multi-national randomized clinical trial is to determine if a specific probiotic agent, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG(LGG), the most widely available, studied and regulated probiotic in the US, should routinely be administered to outpatient children who are suffering from AGE. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) to determine the clinical effectiveness of LGG and (2) to determine the safety and side effect profile of LGG in children 3-48 months of age presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with AGE. Study Setting & Design - The study will be conducted in 8 US pediatric emergency departments within the federally funded Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN). We will randomize 900 children to receive 5 days of a probiotic agent (LGG 1 x 1010 CFU twice a day) or placebo. The main outcome is the occurrence of moderate-severe disease as defined by the Modified Vesikari Score, a validated clinical severity score, which incorporates the frequency and duration of diarrhea, frequency and duration of vomiting, height of fever, need for future health-care visits and medical interventions provided. We will also assess the occurrence of adverse events and side effects related to the use of LGG. We will collect stool samples to conduct mechanism of action studies as well as economic data to conduct cost effectiveness analyses in the future. Impact - This study will directly inform clinica practice by providing the first definitive evidence to support recommendations for or against the routine use of probiotics in the treatment of pediatric AGE. In addition it will provide health-car practitioners and policy makers with (a) a clear picture on the potential side effects from probiotic use, and with the data collected (b) knowledge on the mechanism of action and (c) of the potential economic impact of probiotic use on health-care systems and society. Thus, the potential clinical and societal impacts of the proposed study are substantial and the results will guide the standard of care: if positive, guidelines will be able to endorse probiotic administratio with important positive consequences for the health of several million US children annually. Moreover, if beneficial the cost savings to the health-care system and society may be substantial. If the results are negative, a firm recommendation against the routine use of probiotics would be justified. Collaborators - This work is collaboration between leaders in multicenter and AGE research (Schnadower, Freedman, Tarr, Gorelick, Mahajan, Stanley, Roskind, Powell, O'Connel, Ruddy Chun, Levine and Casper) in prestigious Children's Hospitals within a federally funded multicenter network (PECARN) with a strong record in conducting high quality, high impact clinical trials.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Gastroenteritis, or intestinal infection, which usually manifests as vomiting and diarrhea, is one of the most common illnesses of childhood.

Currently, available treatments for this condition are aimed only at the symptoms and complications (e.g. dehydration) and not at modifying the disease process. We propose to study the effectiveness and side effects of a probiotic, LGG, in treating children with gastroenteritis. If successful, this therapeutic intervention would be the frst treatment that actually changes the disease process and would represent an enormous public health advance both in the US, and potentially, globally.",

The proline dehydrogenase gene (PRODH) is located in the common deleted region, and encodes the enzyme that catalyzes proline catabolism. Proline is a neuromodulator at glutamatergic synapses, and the peripheral hyperprolinemia arising from PRODH mutations or CNVs encompassing PRODH, has been associated with cognitive impairment and decreased IQ. We recently reported a highly significant association of hyperprolinemia with SZ. We now provide evidence that two further independent SZ risk factors: Low vitamin-D status, and mutation of the dysbindin gene (Dtnbp1), also cause hyperprolinemia. Our findings suggest convergence of the biological pathways regulated by vitamin-D and DTNBP1, via loss of PRODH expression, with elevated proline as a common SZ endophenotype. Studies have documented the dysfunctional consequences of hyperprolinemia, such as aberrant glutamatergic and dopamine signaling leading to, for example, cognitive deficits and attenuated prepulse inhibition (PPI). Targeting hyperprolinemia in the Dtnbp1 model may therefore positively impact neurotransmitter signaling and restore function. This proposed study is designed to test our hypotheses under the following Specific Aims. Aim 1: To test the relative molecular contributions of low Vitamin D, and PRODH, and DTNBP1 gene variants, to SZ- associated hyperprolinemia. In a SZ patient and control sample (n=250), we will measure plasma proline and Vitamin-D levels, confirming the strong relationship between elevated proline and low Vitamin-D. From our preliminary data, we anticipate that 80% of the measured hyperprolinemia will arise from low vitamin-D, while DTNBP1 and PRODH variants will be responsible for the remaining 20%. Thus, we will perform molecular analyses on our complete study cohort (404 subjects), screening for PRODH, and DTNBP1 variants that alter gene expression, and testing for variant associations, plus interactions with low Vitamin-D, on the outcome of proline elevation. Aim 2: To examine the molecular pathway leading to hyperprolinemia in the Dtnbp1 model. Aim 2A. Molecular analyses will include assay of peripheral and CNS tissue expression of Prodh, p53 regulated genes, and Comt (downstream of Prodh), as well as of cortical, hippocampal and peripheral proline levels. Aim 2B. Utilizing primary neurons and astrocytes from sdy-/- and Prodh+/- mice, we will directly upregulate Prodh expression, via treatment with Vitamin D and the thiazolidinedione drug Rosiglitazone (RZG), testing for restoration of Prodh expression and decreased cellular proline. Aim 3: To target hyperprolinemia in the Dtnbp1 model in vivo. We will examine whether treatment with Vitamin D (Aim 3a), RZG (Aim 3b), and, to seek to reduce the impact of off-target effects, a proline-deficient diet (Aim 3c), compared to vehicle- treatment alone, restores the above pathway in vivo, and prevents or alleviates the Sdy-/- deficit in, for example, PPI and spatial working memory.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An enzyme called 'PRODH', which is encoded by the PRODH gene, normally breaks down the amino acid proline, and we recently found that a large proportion (26%) of people with schizophrenia have 'hyperprolinemia', which is high fasting levels of proline in the blood (and there is evidence that high proline has highly toxic effects in the brain). We have now discovered that two further schizophrenia risk factors- low vitamin-D and mutation of the gene 'DTNBP1', also cause hyperprolinemia, and under this proposed study we will measure the contributions of these risk factors to the development of hyperprolinemia in schizophrenia patients and in a mouse model system that also exhibits hyperprolinemia. We will then test if treatments that turn on the PRODH gene lead to a reduction in proline and rescue the behavioral and learning deficits seen in this mouse model, which if successful would provide compelling evidence for testing whether these treatments also reduce schizophrenia symptoms in this large patient group, and thus has very important public health implications.",

Experimental studies suggest that inadequate vitamin D and ω-3 fatty acid (FA) levels may be involved in the pathogenesis of HTN through multiple biological mechanisms. Observational studies have shown inverse associations of plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels and dietary ω-3 FA intake with blood pressure (BP) and HTN. Small intervention trials of vitamin D and fish oil rich in ω-3 FA suggest possible BP-lowering effects; however, larger trials using adequately high doses of vitamin D and ω-3 FA for the primary prevention of HTN are lacking. The VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL), an NIH-supported, large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2x2 factorial trial, will test 2000 IU/day of vitamin D (as vitamin D3 [cholecalciferol]) and 1 g/day of marine ω-3 FA (eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] + docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) supplements on incident cardiovascular disease and cancer in 20,000 multiethnic men and women with 5 years of treatment and follow-up. VITAL provides an optimal cost-effective setting to examine the effects of both interventions on changes in BP and incident HTN. Further, as this project would begin in parallel with enrollment into the parent VITAL trial, pre-randomization assessments of BP and biomarkers will be possible. In this proposed ancillary study, we will recruit a representative subcohort of 1,000 VITAL participants without baseline HTN from 5 major US metropolitan areas to conduct home-based examinations at baseline and 2 years follow-up through Examination Management Services, Inc (EMSI). We will obtain 24-hour ambulatory BP (ABP), fasting bloods, 24-hour urines, and other clinical assessments in this EMSI subcohort. We will also ascertain incident HTN cases in the overall VITAL trial. We will test the following hypotheses: (1) whether vitamin D and fish oil supplementation lowers 24-hour ABP compared to placebo in the EMSI subcohort of 1,000 participants; (2) whether vitamin D and fish oil supplementation reduces the risk of incident HTN compared to placebo among all randomized VITAL participants without baseline HTN; and (3) whether vitamin D and fish oil supplementation favorably changes HTN-related biomarkers that are putative mechanistic mediators linking vitamin D and ω-3 FAs with HTN compared to placebo.

This proposed study will be a large-scale and long-term randomized trial that will demonstrate whether taking vitamin D or fish oil supplements can lower someone's blood pressure or prevent the development of hypertension. Because high blood pressure is responsible for one out of every six deaths in the United States, the results of this study could possibly improve the health of many people.",

Vitamin D deficiency is widespread among HIV-infected adults and children. This is particularly alarming since there is a higher risk than the general population for complications like osteoporosis, non-AIDS-defining malignancies, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) - all diseases associated with vitamin D deficiency. It is not known how much vitamin D deficiency heightens the risk of complications like CVD, affects immune function and disease progression, or interferes with optimal treatment in the HIV population. The impact of vitamin D deficiency in the HIV population may be compounded even further since the etiology of HIV-related complications like CVD is thought to be related in part to inflammation and detrimental endothelial effects associated with chronic HIV infection-similar proposed mechanisms as vitamin D deficiency. Data suggest that optimal vitamin D status may be protective against these HIV-related complications, and optimizing vitamin D status with oral supplementation in HIV-infected individuals may improve the risk of HIV-related complications by decreasing inflammation and/or improving endothelial dysfunction, and may improve immune function even in individuals on antiretroviral therapy. Developing suitable repletion strategies is crucial to maximizing health status, particularly in HIV-infected children and young adults, where an opportunity exists for disease prevention. However, the best method of vitamin D repletion is not known, and data suggest that some antiretroviral medications interfere with vitamin D metabolism. Thus, we hypothesize that (1) optimizing vitamin D status to the current Institute of Medicine's (IOM) suggested 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration of e20 ng/mL improves CVD risk, inflammation, and CD4 cell counts in HIV-infected individuals, (2) increasing 25(OH)D concentrations to >30 ng/mL improves CVD risk and inflammation to a greater degree than increasing eto 20 ng/mL (the concentration some experts consider optimal for cardiovascular health), and (3) a 'high dose' of oral vitamin D is necessary to achieve 25(OH)D concentrations >30 ng/mL. These hypotheses will be addressed by determining the longitudinal relationships between serum 25(OH)D concentrations, carotid intima-media thickness, pulse wave velocity, pro-inflammatory biomarkers, and CD4 cell counts in HIV-infected children and young adults in a double-blinded, randomized-controlled trial of three different vitamin D dosing regimens given over 24 months in HIV-infected children and young adults (ages 10-25 years) with vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D <20 ng/mL). We will also evaluate the 25(OH)D concentrations from each arm after 6, 12, and 24 months of supplementation, in order to determine a dose-response relationship. These findings could have a sizable impact on health in this population, since vitamin D therapy is inexpensive and associated with few adverse side effects. The PI is an exceptional candidate who is a pediatric infectious diseases specialist with a proven research focus in the metabolic and cardiovascular complications of HIV. She is mentored by a committed, multidisciplinary team of senior investigators with extensive experience in both mentoring and in the research methodologies relevant to this proposal. Future training in all aspects of clinical research, cardiovascular disease risk assessment, and clinical nutrition is planned to facilitate the PI's development into a successful independent physician scientist.","In most studies, HIV-infected individuals have a higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency compared to uninfected individuals. Vitamin D deficiency may contribute to some of the long-term complications of HIV infection, such as cardiovascular disease and increased inflammation. This proposal will advance our understanding of whether correction of vitamin D deficiency affects the risk of these HIV-related complications and/or improves CD4 cell counts.",

A novel therapeutic target, mitochondrial dysfunction, has been implicated in multiple diseases, including heart failure. However, there currently is no specific treatment for mitochondrial dysfunction in human heart failure or any other disease. Mitochondria-based therapy development has been hampered both by limited understanding of how mitochondrial impairment causes cardiac dysfunction, and by a lack of interventions shown to improve mitochondrial function. Recently, we demonstrated in a murine model, that impaired mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation led to an increased myocardial NADH/NAD+ ratio and increased mitochondrial protein acetylation, without affecting mitochondrial ROS production or ATP synthesis. These changes rendered the heart susceptible to chronic stresses, which accelerated the development of heart failure. We observed a similar increase of NADH/NAD+ ratio and increase in protein acetylation in animal models of heart failure due to chronic pressure overload with no prior mitochondrial dysfunction. Supplying the NAD+ precursor, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), to these mice normalized the NADH/NAD+ ratio, prevented increased mitochondrial protein acetylation and improved cardiac function. Though NMN is not orally bioavailable, we and others have shown that oral supplementation with nicotinamide riboside (NR), the precursor from which NMN is produced, also decreases (normalizes) tissue NADH/NAD+ ratio and improves mitochondrial function in mouse models. These animal model results suggest a conceptually innovative mechanism linking mitochondrial dysfunction to the development and progression of heart failure that is distinct from the existing hypotheses of oxidative stress and energy starvation. Thus, we hypothesize that oral supplementation with NR will improve the NADH/NAD+ ratio caused by mitochondrial dysfunction during chronic stresses, and improve functional capacity and ventricular function in systolic heart failure. We therefore propose a first-in-human, safety and tolerability trial of the nutritional supplement, nicotinamide riboside (NR) in 30 participants wit clinically-stable, systolic heart failure. NR is a relative of niacin, but a closer relative of nicotinamide which, unlike niacin, does not induce flushing or pruritis and has no effect on lipid levels. NR does not induce insulin resistance or dysglycemia in mouse models. Thus, NR would potentially be cheap, safe, well-tolerated and readily available. The application is in response to the program announcement of 'Nutrition and Diet in the Causation, Prevention, and Management of Heart Failure' as NR has recently been approved for human use as a health supplement. As NR has not been used therapeutically in heart failure patients, we will utilize the R21 mechanism to support a pilot study with the following aims: 1) to determine the safety and tolerability of NR in patients with clinically-stable, systolic heart failure (LVEF <40%); 2) to determine whether, at the doses employed, NR has measureable effects on leukocyte NAD+ level and NADH/NAD+ ratio; and 3) to explore the potential range of effects of NR supplementation on heart failure surrogate endpoints.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this research project is to develop innovative approaches for heart failure care by translating the laboratory findings in mitochondrial biology and function. We will test a strategy of protecting the heart from mitochondrial dysfunction by increasing NAD+ level in patients with heart failure via dietary supplementation of nicotinamide riboside (NR). The proposed study will determine the safety and tolerability of NR in heart failure patients.",

Arsenic causes many adverse health outcomes, including several types of cancer. However, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Although eliminating As exposure remains the primary goal for preventing As toxicity, cancer risks persist decades after As exposure has been reduced. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms by which As causes human diseases, such as cancer, is critical for developing future intervention strategies to reduce As toxicity. Though As is not mutagenic, an increasing body of literature suggests that As causes epigenetic dysregulation, including altered histone methylation patterns. Thus, dysregulation of histone methylation may be one mechanism by which As causes cancer. Currently, little is known about histone methylation in human populations exposed to As-contaminated drinking water. Importantly, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) provides the methyl groups for histone methylation, and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) is a potent product inhibitor of SAM-dependent methylation reactions; since SAM and SAH are both tightly regulated by folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism, folate nutritional status may also influence histone methylation through its effects on SAM and SAH. However, there is a lack of information in the scientific literature on relationships between SAM, SAH, folate, and histone methylation in As-exposed populations. For this study, [three] histone modifications (H3K36me2, [H3K36me3], H3K79me2) were selected, because they are known to be influenced by As and/or methyl donors in vitro. The first aim of this project is to test the following hypotheses: 1) As exposure increases global [and gene-specific] levels of histone mark H3K36me2, [and causes a corresponding decrease in H3K36me3], in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from Bangladeshi adults who are chronically exposed to As- contaminated drinking water, 2) the global increase in H3K36me2 is mediated by a decrease in histone lysine demethylase 2B (KDM2B) mRNA expression, and 3) H3K36me2 [and H3K36me3] levels persist even after As exposure has been reduced through the use of water filters that remove As. The second aim of this project is to test the hypotheses that folate nutritional status, SAM, SAH, and folic acid (FA supplementation, influence global [and gene-specific] levels of H3K36me2, [H3K36me3], and H3K79me2 in PBMCs from As-exposed Bangladeshi adults enrolled in the Folic Acid and Creatine Trial (FACT), which is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of FA and/or creatine supplementation. Better understanding the relationships between As, folate, and histone methylation will increase our knowledge of the mechanisms by which As causes human diseases, and will improve our ability to design future intervention strategies, such as nutritiona interventions, to prevent or reverse epigenetic dysregulation and thereby reduce disease burden in populations exposed to As-contaminated drinking water.          ","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Worldwide, approximately 140 million people are chronically exposed to arsenic-contaminated drinking water. Although eliminating exposure to arsenic (As) is the primary goal for reducing As toxicity, cancer risks remain elevated decades after exposure to As has been reduced; As-induced epigenetic dysregulation may be one mechanism by which As causes these persistent cancer risks. By taking advantage of a unique repository of biological samples collected for the Folic Acid and Creatine Trial (FACT), a randomized, controlled trial of folic acid and creatine supplementation, this project will improve our understanding of how both As and folate, a nutritional methyl donor, influence histone methylation marks. Better understanding these relationships will improve our ability to design future intervention strategies, such as nutritional interventions, to reduce disease burden in populations that have already been exposed to As.

Epidemiologic evidence suggests that asthma begins in early life and even prior to birth, with risk profiles established during the first few years of life. Although many prenatal an early life exposures have been implicated in risk for asthma, no studies to date have integrated prenatal (maternal) and early life exposures in the child with longitudinal changes in epigenetic and gene expression profiles, microbiome composition, and genetics with clinical outcomes, including the development of asthma in the child. In this application, we propose to harness the wealth of information already collected as part of the 2010 COpenhagen Prospective Study on Asthma in Childhood (COPSAC2010) and further extend the mechanistic scope of those studies with genome-wide assessments of DNA methylation and gene expression at birth, 18 months and 6 years. These rich data will afford us the unique opportunity to pursue the following three specific aims. In Aim 1 we will investigate the impact of maternal exposures during pregnancy on the child's immune and airway development in the first 6 years of life and determine whether these relationships differ in children of mothers with or without asthma. We will consider prenatal exposures that have been implicated in asthma risk, such as maternal asthma, vaginal microbiome, diet, and mode of delivery, among others, and clinical and immunological outcomes in the child, including longitudinal measures of the child's gut, skin and airway microbiome, DNA methylation and gene expression levels in blood cells, early life wheezing, asthma by age 6, exacerbations, lung function and allergic disease. In Aim 2, we will determine how maternal supplementation during pregnancy with fish oil or placebo in a randomized controlled trial affects the child's immune and airway development in the first 6 years of life, an whether these effects differ in children of mothers with or without asthma or interact with other risk factors identified in Aim 1. In Aim 3, we will elucidate interaction effects of maternal exposures in pregnancy (including maternal asthma and fish oil supplementation) and child's genotype at asthma/allergy candidate loci on the occurrence of persistent wheeze in the first 3 yrs. of life, exacerbations, allergic disease, and the development of asthma by age 6. In this aim we will integrate significant findings from Aims 1 and 2 with genotype at known risk loci to identify variants that modify the child's response to relevant environmental exposures, and their associations with DNA methylation and gene expression as well as clinical outcomes. All 3 aims will fill a major gap in the field by developing methods for integrating multiple high-dimensional data sets. The proposed research will contribute to the mechanistic understanding of the prenatal origins of asthma through the integration of detailed data on exposures during pregnancy, longitudinal measures of clinical and immunological outcomes in the child, and gene regulatory processes and genotypes at asthma/allergy risk loci in the child.

In the first funding period (9/29/10-06/30/15), we completed baseline and early follow- up of depression outcomes among nearly 19,000 successfully randomized men and women, aged 50+ years (mean age=65y), who were eligible for incidence or recurrence of late-life depression; nearly 70% of participants have provided pre-randomization blood samples for nutrient biochemical assays. Furthermore, in the Clinical and Translational Science Center (CTSC) component, detailed phenotypic assessments were conducted among a subset of over 1,000 individuals who received in-person structured psychiatric diagnostic interviews, underwent neuropsychological testing, and provided data on dimensional measures of mood, well- being, and social and daily functioning. Finally, another landmark aspect of VITAL-DEP is its substantial racial and ethnic diversity: over 25% of participants are from minority racial and/or ethnic backgrounds, including 19% who are African American. Indeed, our first funding period aims emphasized potential differences in vitamin D response among African Americans, given high risk of low 25(OH)D in this group. However, late- breaking evidence indicates that bioavailable vitamin D is of greatest relevance to race/ethnic differences. In this 5-year renewal proposal, we expand upon what has been achieved in the first period - assembly of a unique trial cohort - and focus on the unprecedented scientific opportunities afforded by this RCT design. Our Primary Aims are: 1) to extend follow-up of mood to examine with high statistical power the long-term (up to 7 years) effects of vitamin D and marine omega-3 fatty acids on depression outcomes among all ~19,000 participants; 2) to examine with high power the impact of biochemical nutrients levels of vitamin D and omega- 3 fatty acids on depression outcomes as well as treatment interaction with baseline biochemical levels. Secondary Aims focus on two critical themes that our particular trial design is uniquely poised to address: 1) racial/ethnic differences in long-term treatment effects; 2) mechanisms, mediators and moderators of mood effects of vitamin D and fish oil in this diverse cohort. Specifically, in a sub-set of 2,000 participants, we will examine relations of bioavailable vitamin D to depression, with attention to race differences in outcomes. Further, among the entire eligible CTSC cohort, we will obtain pre- and post-randomization serum brain- derived neurotrophic factor and targeted plasma metabolite levels to examine biological paths involved in mood responses to vitamin D and fish oil treatment and to test whether biomarker change explains variation in treatment effects. Thus, this proposal not only will ensure comprehensive, definitive testing of the benefits of vitamin D and fish oil for late-life mood but also will inform specific mechanisms involved in a diverse sample.          ","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Biologic and observational evidence supports potential mental health benefits of both vitamin D and marine omega-3 fatty acids. However, it remains unclear whether the use of these supplements can prevent depression or can significantly reduce depressive symptoms in late-life.

Relating epigenomic changes to neurodevelopmental disorders has been challenging. One obstacle is the need to study the relevant tissues at an appropriate stage of the disease process, while another is the difficulty of understanding the relationship of nucleotide and chromatin modifications to complex genetic disorders in which multiple loci interactions underlie expression of the disease. We propose to take advantage of a disorder, neural tube defects (NTDs), in which the existing mouse models closely parallel the human disease and in which several lines of evidence indicate a strong influence in both mouse and man of epigenetic modifications regulating disease expression. We will combine proof of principle studies in the mouse with investigations of human NTD cohorts to examine the relationship between DNA/chromatin methylation and the expressivity of NTDs in genetically susceptible individuals.  The study of epigenetic events contributing to NTDs has multiple distinct advantages over epigenomic investigation of other human diseases, as more than 200 genes are implicated in NTDs by human or animal studies. These provide critical clues to molecular pathways important for normal neurulation. Supporting the existing clinical data, we discovered several NTD-prone mouse mutant lines in which NTD occurrence is sensitive to folic acid supplementation. Folate metabolism is the source of al S-adenosyl methoinine (SAM), which is the primary methyl donor for methylating nucleic acids, proteins and lipids. Providing methyl donors is thought to be a major route through which folate supplementation exerts its beneficial effects on neurulation. We will use cutting edge and emerging technologies applied to mouse and human patient material to interrogate genome wide methylation and chromatin remodeling interactions, correlated with individual genotype, to examine epigenetic effects on the transcriptome and on phenotypic outcome.  This proposal tests the hypothesis that epigenetic modifications in DNA and chromatin in the setting of prenatal supplementation that modulates DNA and chromatin methylation will impact a recognizable pattern of gene expression to either favor or impair neurulation in a manner that can be predicted based on individual genotype. Moreover, we hypothesize that certain patterns will be evident not only in the developing neural tube but also in the peripheral blood and so will be useful in evaluating risk and optimal NTD prevention in a clinical setting. We predict that some DNA and chromatin methylation signatures acquired in utero wil persist postnatally, regardless of whether supplementation continues after birth. Finally, we expect that DNA methylation patterns found in mouse will be present as well-at least at the level of pathways if not individual genes-in human patients affected by an NTD.","There is a critical need to identify patterns of human genetic--modified by epigenetic--variation that will allow individual risks to be accurately assessed. This would enable NTD prevention strategies to be optimized for each family, rather than basing recommendations on whole populations. With our food supply now fortified, folic acid has become the most widely administered medicinal agent in the US today. Therefore, this study will also have broad relevance to human disorders in which folate intake has an implicated role, including major depression, autism, Alzheimer's disease, among others.",

These co-morbidities have been linked to persistently elevated serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines that mimic an aging phenotype known as 'inflamm-aging.' In both  middle-aged HIV+ persons and older HIV seronegative adults, inflamm-aging is associated with more limited  T cell repertoires and increased risk for morbidities and mortality. Our hypothesis is that inflamm-aging is  responsible for the premature immune senescence associated with HIV infection in aging individuals.  Immune senescence, characterized by diminished replicative capacity, has been observed in middle-aged  persons treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (H/VKRT) who achieve immune reconstitution and  undetectable viral loads. Senescent cells are characterized bythe absence ofthe surface marker CD28,  and in advanced senescence express CD57 (CD28-/CD57+ phenotype). Fish oil may be an effective  treatment option for reducing HIV-related inflamm-aging. Cold water fish are rich in the omega-3 fatty acids  eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which have anti-inflammatory effects.. We  propose a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to explore the safety and estimate the  effect size of fish oil to modulate parameters of inflamm-aging and immune senescence in a  well-characterized cohort of 38 HIV+ AA.

Early life and prenatal exposures contribute to the development of these disorders. Pre- and perinatal exposures may confer risk through epigenetic mechanisms, heritable changes in gene expression that occur without directly altering the DNA sequence. While there are several epigenetic mechanisms, DNA methylation is most commonly studied, and the methylation state at certain sites may affect gene activity and expression. Epigenetic patterns are sensitive to environmental exposures and they lie at the interface of the environment and gene expression. It remains unclear, however, whether such changes are causal for disease or whether they are a secondary outcome of the disease. Regardless of mechanisms, finding correlations between disease and methylation patterns on easily accessible materials (such as DNA from cord blood) is important due to the potential utility as biomarkers of disease susceptibility. The overall hypothesis of this application is that DNA methylation changes that occur in early life will affect the risk for developing allergic disorders in childhood, and that epigenetic signatures in cord blood DNA can be used as a biomarker for these childhood outcomes. We will conduct studies to test this hypothesis in a longitudinal birth cohort, Project Viva, in which we have extensive information on prenatal diet and other exposures, cord blood DNA samples collected at birth, and allergic outcomes in childhood. After the screening and validation, we will perform replication studies in two separate birth cohorts: MeDALL(Mechanisms of the Development of Allergy) and Generation R. Our specific aims are: (1) to identify novel regions in the epigenome that are differentially methylated in allergic versus non-allergic children. We will use a high-throughput genome-wide methylation panel and cord blood DNA samples in ~700 subjects from Project Viva and determine regions that are differentially methylated in children with and without allergic outcomes at 7 yrs. of age, and replicate these findings in MeDALL and Generation R. Pyrosequencing will be used to validate associated methylation marks in cord blood, and to assess longitudinal stability of the marks in DNA from ages 3 and 7. (2) To examine whether prenatal exposures such as prenatal diet (antioxidants, primarily vitamin E), maternal smoking, and exposure to ambient air pollution affect differential methylation of genes related to allergic outcomes. (3)To examine whether post-natal exposures such as child's diet, supplement intake, and exposure to air pollution modify the association between differential methylation in cord blood DNA and allergy outcomes in childhood.

In doing so, we may be able to determine ways in which to prevent the development of allergic disorders.",

Vitamin D deficiency is more common among African American (AA) individuals, especially those from urban environments or with obesity. We and others have contributed to increasing evidence that vitamin D insufficiency may contribute to more severe asthma through increased risk of respiratory infection and decreased glucocorticoid sensitivity. Indeed, low vitamin D levels were recently linked with the need for exogenous glucocorticoids and increased asthma severity. Particularly relevant to health disparities, we showed a strong association between vitamin D insufficiency and asthma in urban African American (AA) youth. Because AA youth residing in urban Washington, DC have markedly worse asthma than other racial/ethnic groups (e.g. prevalence rate 20% higher than the national rate 15 and emergency department utilization rates up to 5 times the national rates and nearly 10 times the Healthy People 2010 target rate), we will utilize our access to this population at the extreme of asthma disparities to examine the contribution of vitamin D to disparities in the chronic control and acute severity of asthma. The overall goal of this application is to provide critical epidemiological/molecular information that will inform the interpretation of ongoing and impending randomized clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation in asthma, especially with regard to urban AA youth with asthma.

The results of this trial will determine whether disodium ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (Na2EDTA) chelation therapy receives approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is subsequently accepted to reduce the risk of major adverse events from coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with diabetes. TACT2, if positive, will also promote research into the mechanism(s) of benefits and provide novel insights into the pathobiology of CAD. The Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy (TACT1) was developed in response to a Request for Applications from NCCAM and the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) to address the concern that chelation use was widespread but there were no reliable data on either safety or efficacy. Surprisingly to cardiologists, the chelation strategy,  combination of up to 40 infusions with intravenous disodium EDTA plus oral multivitamins and multiminerals (OMVM) compared with intravenous and oral placebo, led to a significant reduction in the time to first recurrent cardiovascular event in patients with prior myocardial infarction (MI), age 50 or older, already treated with standard evidence based medical therapies (HR 0.74; 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.57- 0.95; p=0.016. The 5-year number needed to treat (NNT) was 12. In the prespecified subgroup with diabetes (n=633), the results were dramatic: the chelation-based strategy reduced the composite primary clinical endpoint by 51% (HR 0.49, 95%CI (0.33 0.75); p<0.001, 5-year NNT 5.5) and reduced total mortality by 43% (p=0.011, 5-year NNT 12). As a result of these findings, and because of the public health impact of cardiovascular disease and of diabetes, we have been encouraged by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the FDA to confirm the results of TACT1. The three Specific Aims of TACT2 are: 1) To determine if the chelation-based strategy in patients with diabetes and prior MI improves event-free survival; 2) To determine if the chelation-based strategy in patients with diabetes and prior MI reduces mortality; 3) To perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of the TACT2 chelation strategy. TACT2 will enroll 1200 diabetic patients 50 years of age or older with a prior MI and a serum creatinine of 2.0 mg/dL or less. Patients will be randomly allocated (1:1) to receive either chelation + OMVM or double placebo and followed for clinical events until the end of the 5 year trial. The primary endpoint will be a composite of all-cause mortality, recurrent  MI, stroke, coronary revascularization, and hospitalization for unstable angina. A Clinical Events Committee masked to treatment assignment will adjudicate events. Principal secondary endpoints will include: (1) all-cause mortality; (2) a composite of cardiovascular mortality, recurrent MI, or stroke; and (3) safety.

Obesity is a state of high adipose-tissue renin-angiotensin system (RAS) activity, hypoadiponectinemia, and vitamin D deficiency. These intertwined metabolic abnormalities contribute to increased cardiovascular risk in obesity. The applicant's prior data support the hypothesis that vitamin D therapy may be an effective strategy to lower adipose-tissue RAS activity and raise circulating adiponectin in obesity; these favorable metabolic profiles could reduce cardiovascular risk in obesity.  The applicant proposes to study 60 obese human subjects in a well-controlled physiologic experimental protocol that is designed to test whether the active vitamin D metabolite, calcitriol, can modulate adipose-tissue RAS activity and influence circulating adiponectin levels in obesity. The specific aims of this project are designed to test: 1) whether calcitriol interacts with the vitamin D receptor to reduce adipose-tissue renin expression in obesity; and 2) whether calcitriol therapy raises circulating adiponectin in obesity. Although each aim addresses a specific relevant metabolic question, both utilize the same study population and core study design to maximize efficiency and resources. Study subjects will be randomized to calcitriol therapy or placebo for two weeks. Aim 1 will evaluate adipose-tissue renin expression before and after intervention, and whether the effect of calcitriol is influenced by genetic variation at Fok1: a functional polymorphism of the vitamin D receptor gene. Aim 2 will assess circulating adiponectin before and after intervention.  The demonstration that vitamin D therapy modulates the expression of hormones that mediate vascular disease (the RAS and adiponectin) is crucial to the current medical debate surrounding vitamin D and its potentially therapeutic properties; it would strongly support the role of vitamin D supplementation in obesity. This is particularly relevant since obesity and vitamin D deficiency are epidemics that occur in tandem, and are the focus of large-scale NIH funded prospective randomized trials. In this regard, the applicant's results could serve as an important physiologic mechanism to explain the results of these concurrent trials; an issue of high relevance for the NIH and NHLBI. The applicant has a long track-record of success in academic research, and extensive experience conducting human physiology studies investigating vitamin D, the RAS, and adiponectin biology in obesity. The NIH has awarded him the NIH F32 (NRSA) and Loan Repayment Awards for his related projects. His research and mentoring environment are strongly suited to successfully complete the proposed research, and he has assembled an experienced team of senior investigators to enhance his training plan and support his future endeavor of becoming an independent investigator.","PROJECT NARRATIVE Obesity, excess adipose-tissue renin-angitoensin system (RAS) activity, and the deficiencies of vitamin D and adiponectin are all unfavorable metabolic profiles that aggregate in tandem, and are all associated with increased cardiovascular risk. The applicant's preliminary data support vitamin D therapy as a potential method to reduce adipose-tissue RAS activity and raise circulating adiponectin in obesity; thus, potentially reducing cardiovascular risk. This research plan proposes to conduct a prospective study to evaluate whether vitamin D therapy lowers adipose-tissue RAS activity and raises adiponectin in obese humans; this demonstration would be of major public health relevance, and in line with the missions of the NIH and NHLBI.",

Notably, the placenta is emerging as a possible source and regulator of circulating maternal vitamin D metabolites because it expresses all components of the vitamin D metabolic pathway and can produce 1,25[OH]2D which doubles during this reproductive state. Nonetheless, few studies have investigated the modulatory role of the placenta on maternal circulating vitamin D metabolites. In addition, although vitamin D is known to influence bone health in the nonpregnant state, it is unclear whether maternal vitamin D status influences maternal and fetal bone health during pregnancy. Animal studies have shown normal bone health outcomes in fetuses from severely vitamin D deficient mice while data from human studies are mixed possibly due to differences among studies in the dietary intakes of calcium, phosphorous, and other nutrients that impact bone health. This study seeks to advance understanding of vitamin D metabolism and requirements during pregnancy by measuring a comprehensive panel of vitamin D biomarkers from pregnant and nonpregnant control women who participated in a feeding study and consumed equivalent intakes of vitamin D and other related nutrients. The Specific Aims are as follows: Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that pregnancy alters blood biomarkers of vitamin D metabolism including 25(OH)D,1,25(OH)2D, 24,25(OH)2D and vitamin D binding protein (DBP). Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that placenta metabolizes vitamin D and contributes to the changes in maternal circulating vitamin D metabolites including 1,25(OH)2D. To achieve this aim, we will measure placental gene and protein expression levels of the megalin-cubilin receptor, 25-hydroxylase (CYP2R1), 1-hydroxylase (CYP27B1), and 24-hydroxylase (CYP24A1) as well as placental metabolite concentrations of 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)2D, 24,25(OH)2D, and DBP. Relationships between placental and maternal biomarkers of vitamin D will be examined and a human placental cell culture model will be employed to investigate vitamin D metabolic flux and guide interpretation of the placental tissue experiments. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that maternal serum 25(OH)D levels associate with maternal and fetal markers of bone metabolism. To achieve this aim, we will examine correlations between maternal markers of vitamin D status (i.e., 25[OH]D and 1,25[OH]2D) and maternal/cord blood levels of biochemical markers of bone health (e.g., parathyroid hormone).","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite growing evidence linking vitamin D to maternal and fetal health outcomes during pregnancy, very little is known about the effect of pregnancy on vitamin D metabolism and requirements. The proposed study will address fundamental biological questions on vitamin D metabolism during pregnancy and is expected to advance current understanding of the relationship between maternal vitamin D status and maternal and fetal bone health. The findings from this study offer the exciting potential of being immediately translatable into maternal vitamin D intake recommendations that will promote optimal health in the population-at-large.",

Traditional CVD risk factors do not completely explain these risks, and therapies with established benefit in the general population have not consistently proven effective in CKD. Animal studies suggest that higher serum phosphate may be a causal risk factor for these outcomes in CKD patients. Similar findings are supported by observational data in humans. Leading international guidelines recommend lowering serum phosphate using binders and dietary phosphate restriction in CKD patients. However, we have recently conducted randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in CKD patients demonstrating that these approaches are minimally effective, difficult for patients adherence, and may cause harm. Novel approaches are needed, and we have identified the lipid drug niacin as a potential therapeutic agent for phosphate lowering. Animal studies demonstrate that niacin blocks intestinal phosphate absorption. Studies in ESRD patients, and our pilot studies in CKD patients, suggest that niacin may substantially lower phosphate levels by approximately 2 to 10 fold more than binders or phosphate restriction. In addition, preliminary data suggest that niacin may slow progression of CKD. Thus, by extension, niacin may ultimately improve fracture, CVD, and ESRD risk in CKD patients. Funded by the NHLBI, AIM-HIGH is a recently completed large RCT of niacin in patients with prevalent CVD, and 12% of AIM-HIGH patients had CKD at baseline. We propose an ancillary study in AIM-HIGH participants with CKD examining the randomized treatment effect of niacin on (1) serum phosphate levels, (2) other measures of mineral metabolism, and (3) change in kidney function over 3 years. This efficient design will provide substantial new insights to treatment of mineral bone disorder in CKD with minimal patient risk, and has the potential to rapidly change clinical practice for the 27 million persons with CKD in the US, and many more worldwide.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic kidney disease is common and strongly linked with risk of fractures, cardiovascular disease, and end stage renal disease. Kidney disease patients have higher serum phosphate levels, and higher phosphate may be causing the higher risk of these outcomes. Leading international consensus guidelines recommend lowering phosphate, but existing therapies are minimally effective. We have identified that the lipid drug niacin lower serum phosphate through a unique mechanism. In a randomized clinical trial among patients with CKD, this study will test whether niacin lowers serum phosphate and other markers of mineral metabolism, and slows progression of CKD over 3 years.",

We have recruited a diverse study population with type 2 diabetes that has or is at risk of DKD and is maintaining excellent adherence to study medications. To extend our study, our experienced study team will apply methods developed and successfully implemented during our initial funding period. Preliminary data demonstrate high retention and adherence rates and successful laboratory protocols.

The underlying mechanism of salt-sensitivity is not fully understood. The overall objective of the proposed study is to investigate the association of urinary excretion of angiotensinogen (AGT), kallikrein, dopamine, norepinephrine, and albumin with salt-sensitivity and potassium-sensitivity of BP and risk of hypertension. The Genetic Epidemiology Network of Salt Sensitivity (GenSalt) is an NHLBI-sponsored dietary feeding-study conducted among 1,906 participants living in rural China during October 2003-July 2005. The dietary interventions included a 7-day low-sodium feeding (51.3 mmol/day), a 7-day high-sodium feeding (307.8 mmol/day), and a 7-day high-sodium feeding with oral potassium supplementation (60 mmol/day). BP measurements were obtained on each of 3 days during the baseline and each of the 3 intervention periods. Two follow-up examinations to investigate the incidence of hypertension were conducted in the GenSalt study participants during August 2008-December 2009 and August 2011-May 2012. The GenSalt-replication study was conducted among 698 participants living in the same region using an identical study protocol from April to November of 2010.

Diabetes affects 1 in 10 persons in the United States and is projected to increase to 1 in 4 persons by 2050. Women with type 2 diabetes have worse outcomes than men with type 2 diabetes. This may be due to depression which affects over 25% of women with diabetes. Depression interferes with self-care behaviors and significantly impacts glycemic control. Antidepressants are effective for the treatment of depression but can disrupt glycemic control and cause weight gain, making diabetes self-management challenging. Research has shown that vitamin D supplementation can improve depressive symptoms in healthy, obese individuals suggesting its use for amelioration of these symptoms in other groups. We recently completed a six month proof of concept study using a one group, pre-post test design to examine the effects of weekly vitamin D supplementation (50,000 IUs weekly) in women with type 2 diabetes who had significant depressive symptoms (a score > 16 on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Tool (CES-D) (NIH 5P60DK020595, pilot project). We found a significant decrease in depression symptoms, improvements in diabetes self- management, and a decrease in systolic blood pressure. Several small studies have shown that vitamin D supplementation may lower blood pressure by direct and indirect vascular effects. We now propose a randomized trial to determine the efficacy of vitamin D3 supplementation on depressive symptoms, self- management, and blood pressure in women with type 2 diabetes who have significant depressive symptoms (n=150). Using a stratified block randomization (strata based on depression symptom severity) women will be assigned to either weekly vitamin D3 supplementation (50,000 IUs) or a matching weekly placebo for a period of six months. Since guidelines recommend assessing vitamin D levels at three months upon initiating this dose, study measurements will be collected at baseline, three, and six months. The following outcomes will be measured: depressive symptoms, diabetes self-management (self-efficacy, diabetes distress, diabetes self- care behaviors), and systolic blood pressure. We hypothesize that women receiving vitamin D3 supplementation will report fewer depressive symptoms, increased diabetes self- management mediated by depression improvement, and have a lower systolic BP compared to those taking placebo. We will also explore a possible mechanistic effect of vitamin D supplementation on depression. Evidence indicates that in depression, pro-inflammatory biomarkers, notably cytokines and C-reactive protein (CRP), are elevated. Some of these inflammatory biomarkers alter the metabolic pathway of tryptophan by shunting it away from serotonin synthesis via stimulation of the enzyme indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO). Several studies (not depression studies) have reported that Vitamin D can decrease levels of inflammatory biomarkers. Thus we will explore whether vitamin D supplementation decreases inflammatory biomarkers (CRP, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor- ¿) providing evidence for a plausible mechanism of antidepressant activity. Vitamin D supplementation has minimal side effects and is low in cost. Thus, the potential for using this therapy is highly significant fr women with type 2 diabetes and other chronic populations who suffer from symptoms of depression which significantly impacts the self-management of their health.

Several lines of evidence suggest that vitamin D supplements might substantially reduce the risk of falls, potentially by > 25% in persons with low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels. However, trial evidence is insufficient to guide policy. The proposed study is a seamless, two stage, Bayesian response-adaptive randomized trial for dose-ranging and efficacy confirmation. The trial is designed to identify the best overall dose of vitamin D supplementation and confirm the level of efficacy of that dose for fall prevention. Participants wil be community-dwelling adults, aged 70+ (~40% black, ~60% women), with a baseline serum 25(OH)D level of 10-29 ng/ml, who report at least one fall in the prior year.  After an initial pilt phase to evaluate recruitment strategies and finalize data collection procedures, participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 4 vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) test doses: 200IU, 1000IU, 2000IU and 4000IU/d. Participants will take their assigned pills for 2 years with extended follow-up off therapy for 1 more year. Stage 1 of this design will select the best dose of vitamin D for prevention of falls over a 6m follow-up period. Participants in the control (200IU) and best dose group will continue seamlessly into Stage 2 with additional recruitment and continued follow-up of all participants. The principal outcome (Stage 2) is time to first fall (or death) over 2 years f therapy. Secondary outcomes are fall rates, patterns of falling, gait speed, balance, muscle strength, frailty, SPPB score, and, in a sample of participants, 400m walk time and accelerometry. Falls will be ascertained from fall calendars completed daily by participants. Follow-up visits will occur at 3, 12, 24 and 36m. Subgroups with potential for differential benefit from vitamin D supplementation are pre- specified as: a) race (blacks vs others), b) baseline vitamin D levels (10-19 vs 20-29ng/ml), and c) frailty status (frail, pre-frail, not frail). Our prven capacity to recruit a diverse population, including large numbers of blacks, allows us to test the effects of vitamin D supplementation in key subgroups.  Strengths of the study include a team of interdisciplinary investigators who have vast experience and an exceptional track record in the design, conduct, analysis and dissemination of clinical trials, many of which have guided policy. The investigative team includes individuals with expertise in vitamin D metabolism, endocrinology, geriatrics, assessment of physical function and falls, biostatistics, epidemiology, central laboratory procedures, adaptive designs, community engagement, and recruitment. Building on our record in previous community-based trials, we expect that trial results will be timely, rigorous, and directly relevant to public health guidelines and will immediately influence fall prevention policies related to vitamin D supplementation in older persons.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vitamin D supplements might substantially reduce the risk of falls, potentially by more than 25%.

Diabetes affects 1 in 10 persons in the United States and is projected to increase to 1 in 4 persons by 2050. Women with type 2 diabetes have worse outcomes than men with type 2 diabetes. This may be due to depression which affects over 25% of women with diabetes. Depression interferes with self-care behaviors and significantly impacts glycemic control. Antidepressants are effective for the treatment of depression but can disrupt glycemic control and cause weight gain, making diabetes self-management challenging. Research has shown that vitamin D supplementation can improve depressive symptoms in healthy, obese individuals suggesting its use for amelioration of these symptoms in other groups. We recently completed a six month proof of concept study using a one group, pre-post test design to examine the effects of weekly vitamin D supplementation (50,000 IUs weekly) in women with type 2 diabetes who had significant depressive symptoms (a score > 16 on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Tool (CES-D) (NIH 5P60DK020595, pilot project). We found a significant decrease in depression symptoms, improvements in diabetes self- management, and a decrease in systolic blood pressure. Several small studies have shown that vitamin D supplementation may lower blood pressure by direct and indirect vascular effects. We now propose a randomized trial to determine the efficacy of vitamin D3 supplementation on depressive symptoms, self- management, and blood pressure in women with type 2 diabetes who have significant depressive symptoms (n=150). Using a stratified block randomization (strata based on depression symptom severity) women will be assigned to either weekly vitamin D3 supplementation (50,000 IUs) or a matching weekly placebo for a period of six months. Since guidelines recommend assessing vitamin D levels at three months upon initiating this dose, study measurements will be collected at baseline, three, and six months. The following outcomes will be measured: depressive symptoms, diabetes self-management (self-efficacy, diabetes distress, diabetes self- care behaviors), and systolic blood pressure. We hypothesize that women receiving vitamin D3 supplementation will report fewer depressive symptoms, increased diabetes self- management mediated by depression improvement, and have a lower systolic BP compared to those taking placebo. We will also explore a possible mechanistic effect of vitamin D supplementation on depression. Evidence indicates that in depression, pro-inflammatory biomarkers, notably cytokines and C-reactive protein (CRP), are elevated. Some of these inflammatory biomarkers alter the metabolic pathway of tryptophan by shunting it away from serotonin synthesis via stimulation of the enzyme indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO).

Kidney disease is associated with a significantly increased risk of morbidity and mortality even before reaching end-stage kidney disease. Animal studies and observational studies in humans, including studies by investigators leading this proposed study, suggest that vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids may be protective against kidney disease. Despite the evidence base available, there is still no definitive study testing the effects of these relatively safe nutritional supplements on kidney disease progression in humans. We now have an opportunity to provide such data in a highly feasible and cost-efficient manner. We propose to take advantage of the VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) trial to test whether vitamin D3 (at a dose of 2,000 IU/day) or omega-3 fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic acid plus docosahexaenoic acid, 1 gm/day) will preserve kidney function, as measured by serum creatinine and cystatin C, over a 4 year period. The VITAL trial is an NIH funded, placebo-controlled clinical trial randomizing 25,875 participants (men older than 50 and women older than 55 years) in a 2x2 factorial design to vitamin D3 versus placebo and omega-3 fatty acids versus placebo for 5 years to evaluate effects on cardiovascular disease and cancer events. The VITAL trial is not currently planning to evaluate kidney function in participants with hypertension. We, therefore, propose to measure serum creatinine and cystatin C and urinary albumin and creatinine at year 4 post-randomization in 4000 participants of the VITAL trial who at baseline have hypertension, no diabetes mellitus, are older than 60 years and have pre-randomization blood samples available collected by the parent study. We estimate that with these entry criteria, 25% of our 4000 patients will have an eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73m2 and 25% will be ethnic and racial minorities. We will evaluate changes in estimated GFR calculated by serum creatinine and cystatin C levels over a 4 year period, the incidence of end-stage renal disease, prevalent albuminuria at year 4 and parathyroid hormone, calcium and FGF-23 levels at baseline and year 4 in the subset with eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73m2. The proposed study takes advantage of the infrastructure and design of the VITAL trial to provide much needed data about the effects of vitamin D3 and omega-3 fatty acids on the kidney.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will evaluate whether vitamin D3 and omega-3 fatty acids, inexpensive, over-the-counter supplements, prevent kidney disease in a large, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of individuals with hypertension.

In this application, we propose to examine the role of the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin, and its primary regulator vitamin D, in lung function impairment, respiratory infections and acute exacerbations of COPD as well as evaluate the effect of oral vitamin D supplementation on lung cathelicidin levels in humans. Cathelicidin has bactericidal and inflammatory activities in the lung and is regulated by vitamin D levels. Our hypothesis is that reduced cathelicidin levels are associated with accelerated lung function decline though a pathway partially mediated by increased infections and COPD exacerbations. We hypothesize the effect of cathelicidin on lung function is greater in those with vitamin D insufficiency and that oral vitamin D supplementation will raise cathelicidin levels in the pulmonary compartment, thereby restoring lung cathelicidin deficiency. Specifically, through longitudinal investigation nested within an ongoing cohort study of urban, predominantly African-American individuals at high risk for development of OLDs, we will characterize the rate of lung function decline in 380 participants followed with serial spirometry measures for up to six years. Baseline and repeated measures of cathelicidin and vitamin D will be examined as independent predictors of lung function decline and respiratory infections. Separately, using longitudinal data from 2100 participants enrolled in the Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study (SPIROMICS) study with established COPD, baseline measures of blood cathelicidin and vitamin D will be examined as an independent predictor of longitudinal FEV1 decline and COPD exacerbations over three years. In both cohorts, concurrent vitamin D measurements will permit evaluation of antecedent and modifier on the cathelicidin-lung outcomes relationships. Finally, we will measure blood and lung lavage cathelicidin levels in 40 vitamin D insufficient individuals before and after eight weeks of oral vitamin D supplementation to determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on cathelicidin levels. Completion of these aims will provide a robust determination of the role of cathelicidin in lung function decline and adverse pulmonary outcomes in unique populations of at-risk and diseased individuals. Moreover, the aims of this application directly or indirectly wor towards ultimately understanding if a readily measurable blood marker, cathelicidin, can inform who may benefit from vitamin D supplementation to prevent chronic lung disease. The results from this application would lead to a therapeutic intervention study that will provide further opportunities to improve our understanding of the relationship between vitamin D, cathelicidin and lung function.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal will evaluate a potential mechanism of increased risk of lung function impairment, as well as determine if vitamin D replacement can alter this pathway. This application will improve the understanding of factors which can lead to chronic lung disease.

A major breakthrough for prevention and cure has been the appreciation that breast cancer is not one disease, rather a collection of cancer subtypes becoming better defined by improved methodologies based upon histopathologic, genetic and molecular signatures. Over time we have applied histological type, grade, tumor size, lymph-node involvement, and estrogen receptor (ER) and HER-2/neu receptor status to help define prognosis and probability of response to therapies, yet these alone have not fully captured the varied behavior of breast cancer. The field is now rapidly progressing with gene expression and proteomic signatures that will help 'personalize' our interventions for individuals. This same concept is relevant to interventions for primary or secondary prevention and is the focus of our translational grant application. Our pre-clinical studies have demonstrated a strong benefit for dietary ω-3 fatty acid rich fish oil for the inhibition of ERPR(-)HER-2/neu(+) mammary tumors in a transgenic mouse model showing decreased tumor incidence, multiplicity and glandular atypia. Thus, our central hypothesis is that the development of aggressive breast cancer sub-types such as of ERPR(-)HER-2/neu(+) or ERPR(-)HER-2/neu(-) (i.e. triple negative) disease may be uniquely responsive to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), the long chain ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) found in fish oil. As a first step towards a future definitive prevention trial in women, we propose to test the efficacy of an ω-3 rich fish il supplement to modulate breast biomarkers indicative of anti-carcinogenic action. We will randomize high risk survivors to a placebo-low dose or high dose ω-3 rich fish oil capsule treatment and employ our breast fine needle aspiration techniques to obtain cells and tissue for analysis of biomarkers of exposure and efficacy. Our multidisciplinary team has developed the following Specific Aims to: (1) Determine the effects of dietary ω-3 fatty acids on biomarkers of exposure and response in women at high risk for recurrent estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor breast cancer +/- HER-2/neu overexpression; and (2) Define the role of dietary ω-3 PUFAs in the epigenetic regulation of the inflammatory responses underlying mammary carcinogenesis as a novel mechanism for the effects of ω-3 PUFAs. Development of these biomarkers of ω-3 PUFA exposure and response will enable the assessment of this bioactive food component in future large-scale prevention trials for women at risk for recurrence of ERPR(-)HER-2/neu(+) or triple negative breast cancer.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The genetic and molecular heterogeneity of breast cancer accounts for wide variability in clinical response and outcome and thus mandates the development of innovative targeted therapies and prevention strategies. The unresolved role of dietary fat content and specifically ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in human breast carcinogenesis, despite compelling pre-clinical studies, raises the possibility that response to dietary fat depends on critical nutrient-gene interactions that may vary between subjects and/or breast cancer subtypes. This study aims to determine the effects of dietary ω-3 fatty acids on biomarkers of exposure and response in women at high risk for recurrent estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor negative breast cancer +/- HER- 2/neu overexpression and their role in the epigenetic regulation of the inflammatory responses underlying mammary carcinogenesis.",

In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that quercetin can decrease expression of miRNA-155 in macrophages, and thus, decrease tumorigenesis in obesity-enhanced CRC. In Aim 3, we will employ a case-control design to being to determine the clinical efficacy of miRNA-155 as a biomarker for CRC, and further, assess the associations and predictive ability of miRNA-155 and advanced-stage and high-grade. The proposed investigation is significant as it addresses prevention of incidence and progression of obesity-enhanced CRC by using a dietary food component to target macrophage-induced inflammation that is thought to at the mechanistic core of this disease.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Inflammation has been implicated as a link between obesity and colorectal cancer. Adipose tissue macrophages are primary sources of inflammation; however there has been no systematic evaluation of the regulation of macrophage-induced inflammation in obesity-enhanced colorectal cancer. In this proposed investigation, we will evaluate whether macrophage-induced inflammation is regulated by miRNA-155 in a mouse model of obesity-enhanced colorectal cancer, and whether dietary quercetin can target this process. Further, we will begin to evaluate the clinical efficacy of miRNA-155 as a biomarker for colorectal cancer.",

Once established, AF is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and current treatment options are associated with limited long term success rates and significant risks. In this application, we propose to evaluate the balance of benefits and risks of marine omega-3 fatty acid (840 mg eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] + docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) and vitamin D3 (2,000 IU/day cholecalciferol) on AF incidence in the setting of an NIH-funded large-scale clinical trial, the Vitamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL). VITAL is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2x2 factorial trial specifically designed to evaluate the efficacy of vitamin D3 and marine omega-3 fatty acid supplements in the primary prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease among 20,000 men (aged 50+ years) and women (aged 55+ years). Based upon data in cellular, animal, and human studies, both of the study agents have the potential to influence arrhythmic risk in general and AF risk specifically, both positively and negatively. However, definitive data from randomized trials are lacking, particularly with respect to primary prevention. In this application, we propose an ancillary study to ascertain and adjudicate AF outcomes for the primary aim of testing whether omega-3 fatty acid and/or vitamin D3 supplementation influences AF risk in an older population, where the incidence of AF is growing substantially. Case validation of incident AF will involve systematic ascertainment of physician diagnoses of AF on annual study questionnaires supplemented by CMS linkage followed by collection of detailed diagnostic information from outpatient and inpatient medical records. An endpoint committee composed of cardiologists will confirm incident AF events based on medical record review. As a secondary aim of the proposal, electrocardiograms will also be obtained at baseline and again after two years of treatment and follow-up among a sub-cohort of 1000 patients evaluated at the VITAL Clinical and Translational Science Center to assess whether and to what extent vitamin D3 or omega-3 supplementation might impact electrocardiographic parameters, which could serve as intermediate phenotypes for heart rhythm disorders. To address tertiary aims, detailed information on timing and mechanism of death will also be collected in the entire cohort to explore treatment effects on arrhythmic death, and EPA/DHA along with 25(OH) vitamin D levels will be measured in baseline blood samples in a nested case-cohort design to explore if baseline levels modify treatment effects on AF incidence. In summary, we propose a timely and cost-effective strategy that takes advantage of the enormous investment of resources and infrastructure in the VITAL trial to provide much needed data on the summation of benefits and risks of these agents on AF incidence as well as other arrhythmic endpoints. If either agent significantly lowers AF risk, then these agents would represent one of the first therapies proven effective for the primary prevention of this growing morbid disease.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained heart rhythm disturbance and accounts for approximately 15% of strokes and is associated with doubling of mortality. Once established, atrial fibrillation is difficult to treat; and therefore, research directed at prevention of atrial fibrillation is essential. Existing biologic and observational evidence supports potential health benefits of marine omega-3 fatty acids and Vitamin D which might prevent atrial fibrillation. However, due to lack of definitive data from large-scale clinical trials, it remains unclear whether AF can be delayed or prevented by use of these supplements. Findings from this proposed study conducted within a large clinical trial will clarify whether vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid supplementation reduces risk of developing AF and provide important data that will be applicable to public health and clinical guidelines for AF prevention.",

Health effects associated with WSP include acute bronchitis, asthma exacerbation, pneumonia, cough and systemic inflammation in in healthy persons and those with asthma. Cardiovascular effects have also been reported with WSP exposure. WSP from wildland fires can cause abrupt increases in ambient air PM 2.5 levels, and avoidance of rapidly increasing PM air pollution is not feasible as many residents cannot leave the burn region, and wildland firefighters move into wildland fire sites, often for several consecutive days. As avoidance of PM is not feasible in these settings, there is a clear unmet need for interventions to reduce adverse health effects caused by acute WSP exposure. Our team has developed gamma tocopherol (gT), an isoform of vitamin E with robust anti-inflammatory actions, as a chemopreventive intervention for inflammation caused by environmental contaminants. Our animal studies show that gT inhibits allergen, ozone and endotoxin-induced airway inflammation. Our human phase I studies show that gT decreases inflammatory response of circulating monocytes, decreases nitrosative stress, and inhibits neutrophil (PMN) influx to the airway in vivo after endotoxin challenge. Thus, gT supplementation is an attractive nutritional/nutraceutical approach to decreasing the adverse health effects of inhaled WSP. We have also developed a 500µg/m3 WSP exposure protocol which induces both airway and systemic increases in PMNs in human volunteers. Using this challenge protocol, we will undertake a randomized, placebo-controlled study to determine if of supplementation with 1200 mg of on WSP-induced airway and systemic PMN increases in healthy and asthmatic volunteers. Exploratory endpoints will include non-specific bronchial reactivity (NSBR), and cardiovascular responses reported to be impacted by PM exposure. These studies will also allow us to compare responses of allergic asthmatic (AA) and healthy volunteers (HV) to determine if atopy or other facets of asthma modify risk for inflammatory response to WSP. This study will be the first to test a specific nutritional supplement as a chemopreventive intervention for WSP-induced inflammation in either AAs or NVs, and to specifically compare the response of these groups to WSP-induced inflammation.          ","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we will examine the ability of supplementation with gamma tocopherol (gT), a form of naturally occurring vitamin E, to prevent lung and systemic inflammation following exposure to wood smoke particles (WSP) in healthy and asthmatic volunteers. WSPs from wildfires are a major contributor to air pollution. Many people cannot escape areas where there is increased fire related WSP air pollution, so safe and inexpensive treatments (such as gT) are urgently needed to prevent environmentally-induced lung disease.

Endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide or LPS) is a component of coarse and fine mode PM, bioaerosols, tobacco and biomass smoke. Ozone (O3) is the most commonly encountered ambient air pollutant in the US. Epidemiological studies have shown that both LPS and O3 are important asthma triggers. In challenge studies of AAs, we have shown that LPS and O3 induces influx of neutrophils (PMNs) and eosinophils in AAs as well as augmenting response to inhaled allergens. O3 is also an oxidant, and both O3 and LPS increase radical production by airway cells, with both nutritional and genetically defined antioxidant deficiencies (such as the GSTM1 null genotype) being associated with increased risk for pollutant-induced asthma exacerbation. In challenge studies, we have reported that LPS and O3 PMN responses are increased in GSTM1 null volunteers. Gamma tocopherol has known antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions. We have shown that γT prevents allergen, O3 and LPS-induced respiratory tract inflammation in rodents. Our phase I human studies with γT-mT established a dose which maintains γT and its anti-inflammatory metabolites, decreases monocyte responses to LPS and IgE-mediated basophil response to allergen.

As life expectancy increases, co-morbidities such as CF-related diabetes (CFRD) become more prevalent. It is thus increasingly important to identify pathophysiologic pathways that will inform nutritional therapies for adult patients with CF. Recent advances in metabolomics analysis provide a novel opportunity to broadly explore metabolism and underlying pathways relevant to disease exacerbation and recovery in CF. The PI, Jessica A. Alvarez, PhD, RD, will use high-resolution, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomics methods as a tool to interrogate the plasma metabolome in cohorts of adult CF patients, with or without CFRD, in collaboration with a multidisciplinary team of expert mentors (including Lead Mentor Dr. Thomas R. Ziegler and Co-Mentors Drs. Dean P. Jones, Vin Tangpricha, Arlene A. Stecenko, and Nael A. McCarty). Based on preliminary clinical and metabolomics research findings by the PI and the mentoring team, the working hypotheses of this project are: 1) aminothiol redox imbalance in CF contributes to impaired fatty acid �-oxidation, and 2) vitamin D supplementation normalizes the redox system and, subsequently, �-oxidation. Specific Aim 1 is to confirm a defect in �- oxidation in adult CF subjects using high-resolution targeted plasma metabolomics analysis and complementary in vivo bioenergetic assessment methods (indirect calorimetry,31phosphorus-magnetic resonance spectroscopy) in a cross-sectional study of adult subjects with CF compared to healthy, age matched controls. Specific Aim 2 will determine if plasma aminothiol redox status is associated with �-oxidation in this cross-sectional study. Specific Aim 3 is a pilot study to determine the impact of high-dose oral vitamin D3 on indexes of �-oxidation and aminothiol redox in adult CF patients hospitalized for pulmonary exacerbation and followed during clinical recovery in an ongoing, double-blind, randomized controlled trial. Emory University boasts an intellectually rich research environment whose resources will be used to carry out the proposed research, including an NIH-funded Atlanta Clinical and Translational Science Institute Clinical Research Network site. The primary goal of this K01 career development proposal is for Dr. Alvarez to develop expertise in high-resolution metabolomics for use in clinically oriented nutrition research, which will highly complement her nutrition and metabolism training to-date.

But during this life-cycle stage children living in poverty are often vulnerable to negative influences including malnutrition, illnesses, an un-stimulating environments, possibly preventing them from reaching their full potential and perpetuating poverty across generations. Small-scale studies have demonstrated that offering stimulation and nutrition to young children can have positive effects on short and long-term outcomes, such as cognition, self-esteem, depression and other important measures. However it has not yet been demonstrated that these interventions can be scaled-up to form the basis of sustainable and effective policy towards child development. The project will introduce a stimulation program, coupled with micronutrient supplementation, to improve interactions between mothers and their young children with the aim of achieving better child outcomes. The program will follow a systematic weekly curriculum based on the natural developmental stages of the child. It will be implemented in rural communities of Odisha in India, an area where poverty and malnutrition are prevalent. It will be delivered by women from within the communities, which will have been trained for this purpose, in the following forms: (i) weekly individual home visits to the child and its main caregiver/mother, or (ii) in a suitably modified way, within the context of weekly main caregiver/mother and child group meetings. The intervention will be accompanied by an evaluation based on a randomized control trial with five variants including a control group. Data will be collected on child developmental outcomes and detailed maternal- and household-level data before the start, halfway through and at the end of the intervention. Having local women deliver the intervention is key to designing low-cost and sustainable policies. The formation of groups could further reduce costs and enhance the dissemination of good child rearing practices. The aim is to test for effectiveness and to understand the pathways through which these interventions achieve their outcomes. As such the project relates directly to the NIH mission of applying knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce the burdens of illness.

Thus, finding factors that can lead to prevention of this disease would be of great public health importance. Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent among pregnant women, and thus, represents a potentially modifiable factor for the prevention of disease. Due to the effect of vitamin D in the development of the lung and the immune system in utero, we believe that vitamin D deficiency in pregnant mothers leads to increased risks for developing asthma and allergy in early childhood. Epidemiologic studies that have investigated the role of vitamin D in early life and the development of asthma, wheeze and allergy have inconsistent results. Because of the wide prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, a clinical trial is the only way t confidently answer the question of whether higher vitamin D levels in pregnancy can prevent asthma and allergies in the mother's offspring. Over the past 4 years, we have been conducting a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of maternal vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy, and we are now following the children (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00920621). We recruited 881 women, and randomized them to one of two arms: 4,000 IU vitamin D3 daily plus a prenatal vitamin containing 400 IU vitamin D3 vs. a placebo plus a prenatal vitamin containing 400 IU vitamin D3. We followed them through pregnancy and there were 810 live births with 801 currently under follow-up. The goal of the current project is to follow the children through age 6 years. The specific aims for the renewal of VDAART are: (1) to determine whether maternal supplementation of vitamin D during pregnancy is associated with reduced incidence of asthma in the child during the first 6 years of life; (2) to determine whether maternal supplementation of vitamin D during pregnancy is associated with reduced secondary outcomes in the child of: (a) allergic sensitization (total and specific IgE), (b) doctor's diagnosis of eczema, (c) doctor's diagnosis of allergic rhinitis, (d) food allergies and (e) lower respiratory tract infections by ag 6 years; (3) to determine whether maternal supplementation of vitamin D during pregnancy is associated with greater lung growth in the children up to age 6, as measured by impulse oscillometry and spirometry; and (4) to continue to collect biologic material from the children for mechanistic studies related to vitamin D in asthma and allergies, including specimens for genomic and epigenomic studies and microbiome studies.

Thus, finding factors that can lead to prevention of this disease would be of great public health importance. Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent among pregnant women, and thus, represents a potentially modifiable factor for the prevention of disease. Due to the effect of vitamin D in the development of the lung and the immune system in utero, we believe that vitamin D deficiency in pregnant mothers leads to increased risks for developing asthma and allergy in early childhood. Epidemiologic studies that have investigated the role of vitamin D in early life and the development of asthma, wheeze and allergy have inconsistent results. Because of the wide prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, a clinical trial is the only way t confidently answer the question of whether higher vitamin D levels in pregnancy can prevent asthma and allergies in the mother's offspring. Over the past 4 years, we have been conducting a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of maternal vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy, and we are now following the children (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00920621). We recruited 881 women, and randomized them to one of two arms: 4,000 IU vitamin D3 daily plus a prenatal vitamin containing 400 IU vitamin D3 vs. a placebo plus a prenatal vitamin containing 400 IU vitamin D3. We followed them through pregnancy and there were 810 live births with 801 currently under follow-up. The goal of the current project is to follow the children through age 6 years. The specific aims for the renewal of VDAART are: (1) to determine whether maternal supplementation of vitamin D during pregnancy is associated with reduced incidence of asthma in the child during the first 6 years of life; (2) to determine whether maternal supplementation of vitamin D during pregnancy is associated with reduced secondary outcomes in the child of: (a) allergic sensitization (total and specific IgE), (b) doctor's diagnosis of eczema, (c) doctor's diagnosis of allergic rhinitis, (d) food allergies and (e) lower respiratory tract infections by ag 6 years; (3) to determine whether maternal supplementation of vitamin D during pregnancy is associated with greater lung growth in the children up to age 6, as measured by impulse oscillometry and spirometry; and (4) to continue to collect biologic material from the children for mechanistic studies related to vitamin D in asthma and allergies, including specimens for genomic and epigenomic studies and microbiome studies. Findings from this important study will have great public health importance in the prevention of asthma and allergies in childhood.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma and allergies are among the most common chronic disorders in childhood and they account for over 56 billion dollars in health care costs annually. We are investigating whether vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy can prevent the development of these disorders in children, through a randomized clinical trial.

The resolution of this controversy is important since  almost 20 million older adults (or one-half of the older U.S. adult population) have 25(OH)D concentrations  between 20 and 30 ng/mL. There is growing evidence that vitamin D's effect on reducing falls is mediated by  improvements in neuromuscular function. Observational studies show associations between 25(OH)D  concentrations and muscle strength and physical performance measures associated with fall risk (e.g., gait,  balance).

Understanding how these spillovers work within the household could enable the design of smarter health policies which take into account households' optimal readjustments. But we cannot fully measure these reallocation responses without data on dietary intake, which is arguably the most important health resource, especially for children in low-income settings. I propose to 1) acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to collect such data, and 2) use it to analyze the effects of nutrition interventions on the intra-household distribution of food and other health resources.  To accomplish the first goal, I will engage in three training activities which will enable me to learn about key concepts in nutritional science and measurement issues in dietary intake assessment in low-income settings: 1) coursework, 2) mentoring meetings, and 3) dissemination of my work. To accomplish the second, I will engage in a research program related to understanding the intra-household spillovers of targeted nutrition interventions, focusing on iodine supplementation.  Iodine deficiency disorder (IDD) has significant and irreversible effects on cognitive development.  One third of the global population has IDD. Low in utero exposure to iodine leads to reduced intelligence quotients, and in severe cases can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm delivery and growth, hearing and speech problems. Iodine supplementation and fortification programs-both in utero and in early childhood-have been proven to increase child health and cognitive ability, and are thus often used as policy tools in affected areas. Supplementation programs are usually targeted towards pregnant women and young children. However, little is known about how these interventions affect other children in the household who are not targeted.  My research program has 3 specific aims: 1) collect novel data which combine socioeconomic and demographic information with dietary intake measurements for every child in the household; 2) document the patterns of intra-household allocation of food and other health resources; and 3) study the effects of fetal and early childhood iodine supplementation interventions on the intra-household distribution of food and other health resources amongst children.  I will accomplish the first aim by designing a dietary intake assessment module and integrating it into a large-scale household panel survey in Ghana. I will accomplish Aim 2 by performing preliminary analyses with these new data. I will accomplish the last aim through two studies. In the first, I will study the effects of a large feta iodine supplementation program in Tanzania using an existing, nationally representative dataset. In this study, I will apply econometric techniques developed for intra-household analyses to examine whether children exposed to more iodine while in utero receive more health resources than their untreated siblings during childhood. In the second study, I will implement and analyze data from a pilot field experiment that will distribute iodine supplements to children under 5 in Ghana. The experiment will run concurrently with the panel survey data collection, allowing me to measure the resulting changes in dietary intake and other health resource allocations.  Without quantifying the household responses to childhood nutrition interventions, particularly in the context of iodine supplementation policies, it is impossible to know the full impact of these programs. Answering this question-are we helping or hurting other children in the household through targeted interventions?-is essential to the design and improved cost-benefit analysis of childhood nutrition programs around the world.","It is impossible to gauge the full impacts of childhood nutrition interventions without measuring how households redistribute resources among children in response.

"4","U01","DK097093-04","A Novel Approach to Phosphorus Lowering in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease","","30-Apr-2018","Ix, Joachim H","UNITED STATES","524445","2016","DK","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is highly prevalent and strongly associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Because traditional CVD risk factors do not fully explain the link between CKD and CVD, it is likely that 'non-traditional' risk factors that are altered in CKD may be involved. Among such factors, higher serum phosphorus (Pi) levels represent a causal candidate, and may be modifiable.  Higher serum Pi induces arterial calcification, arterial stiffness, and left ventricular hypertrophy in animals. Similar fidings are observed in humans, and higher Pi levels are also associated with the development and progression of CKD, CVD events and mortality in humans. The KDIGO international clinical practice guidelines recommend targeting Pi within the normal range and recommends using oral phosphorus binders (OPBs) to do so. However, since the recommendations were published, studies have consistently shown that OPBs have minimal efficacy for Pi lowering in CKD stage 3-4, even with very high doses and pill burden, and may be associated with harm. In contrast, animal studies and pilot studies in humans show that nicotinamide (vitamin B3) substantially lowers serum Pi levels, and can do so with only 1-2 pills/day. Nicotinamide reduces Pi through a different mechanism. Rather than binding Pi, it blocks intestinal Pi absorption by down-regulating a key intestinal Pi transporter. The lipid drug niacin contains both nicotinamide and nicotinic acid, and we have shown that it lowers Pi in CKD patients. However, nicotinamide alone may have advantages. Unlike niacin, it does not cause flushing, liver test abnormalities, hyperuricemia, or insulin resistance. Nicotinamide has considerable long-term safety data in the general population, is available over the counter as a dietary supplement in the US, and would cost about $2/patient/month. Thus, nicotinamide may provide a readily available, well-tolerated, inexpensive, and convenient method to lower serum Pi levels in patients with CKD.  However, the efficacy of nicotinamide for Pi lowering in CKD stage 3-4 is unknown. Moreover, the effects of nicotinamide on other components of mineral metabolism including urine phosphorus excretion and counter- regulatory hormones FGF23, PTH, and calcitriol are unknown. Changes in these factors may have their own influences on CVD, CKD progression, and bone health. Thus, nicotinamide is not yet ready for widespread clinical use in CKD patients. The efficacy for Pi lowering and effects on other components of mineral metabolism must first be established.  We propose a phase 2, randomized double blind placebo controlled study among 150 patients with eGFR 20-45ml/min/1.73m2 treated with nicotinamide or placebo for 6 months. Our primary aims are to determine (1) the Pi lowering efficacy, (2) the effects of nicotinamide on other components of mineral metabolism including urine phosphorus excretion and Pi regulatory hormones. If effective and well tolerated, this study will rapidly alter the standard of care by introducing icotinamide for Pi lowering in CKD stage 3-4.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Most patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) die of cardiovascular disease (CVD) before they ever progress to kidney failure, retention of serum phosphorus is a potential explanatory factor, and clinical practice guidelines suggest keeping serum phosphorus concentrations within the normal range in CKD patients. Existing therapies to lower phosphorus in CKD are minimally effective, and may cause harm. We have identified an inexpensive, readily available, convenient vitamin (nicotinamide) that substantially lowers serum phosphorus. This study will establish the phosphorus lowering efficacy of nicotinamide, and its effects on other components of mineral bone disease in CKD patients.",

It is predictive of breast cancer risk for at least 10 years in the futue and has been suggested as a surrogate marker of breast cancer risk. Several states now mandate release of mammographic density data to women. However, except for anti-hormonal therapies (e.g., tamoxifen), no interventions have been proven to reduce breast density. Thus, testing promising, well-tolerated interventions that might affect mammographic density is of substantial interest. Several lines of evidence suggest that vitamin D may play a role in breast density and breast carcinogenesis. Vitamin D reduces proliferation and promotes differentiation and apoptosis in breast cells in culture. However, no large-scale randomized studies have examined the impact of vitamin D on mammographic density. We propose to examine the randomized effects vitamin D3 on mammographic breast density in the NIH sponsored VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL), an ongoing randomized, double blind, trial testing vitamin D3 (2,000 IU/day cholecalciferol) and omega-3 fatty acids (840 mg eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA]+ docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) in the primary prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease in a multi-ethnic population of over 24,000 men and women. In this ancillary sub study, mammograms will be obtained on 4000 women age 55-67 years (25% African-American), from baseline (pre-randomization) and after 1 and 4 years of randomized therapy. Centrally processed quantitative mammographic density and texture variation will be measured. We will determine if randomized vitamin D treatment is associated with change in mammographic features, and whether effects are modified by baseline mammographic density, and baseline 25(OH) vitamin D levels. In addition, tissue samples from women in VITAL undergoing breast biopsy/surgery, for both nonmalignant and malignant conditions, will be collected. Quantitative morphological measures, as well as gene expression assays targeting vitamin D activation and breast carcinogenesis pathways, will be performed on collected tissues among women on randomized vitamin D3 compared with placebo. This ancillary study provides a timely opportunity to test comprehensively the effects of vitamin D3 on mammographic features and breast tissue biology in a randomized setting at minimal additional cost.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Thus far, only hormonal therapies such as tamoxifen have been shown to reduce breast density, and these are associated with a high side effect burden. We propose to examine the randomized effects of vitamin D on mammographic breast density and texture in the ongoing, already-funded VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) study. We will collect baseline (pre-randomization), 1-year and 4-year follow-up mammograms, as well as tissue specimens from women undergoing breast biopsy/surgery for malignant and nonmalignant disease, to further elucidate the role of vitamin D on mammographic features and breast tissue biology. Identifying well-tolerated, promising nutritional agents that could reduce breast density would have important public health implications for women at high risk of breast cancer.",

Over the past four years, the program has produced 206 publications, of which 35% % were intra-programmatic, 28%% were inter-programmatic, and 34% were inter-institutional. A vibrant communications component that includes a seminar series with lecturers from inside and outside the University supports collaborative research among program investigators. Major completed studies at UAB have moved chemopreventive agents from various classes (including rexinoids, cyclooxygenase inhibitors, and dietary polyphenols) to clinical trials during the last few years.","No data",

Several lines of evidence suggest that vitamin D supplements might substantially reduce the risk of falls, potentially by > 25% in persons with low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels. However, trial evidence is insufficient to guide policy. The proposed study is a seamless, two stage, Bayesian response-adaptive randomized trial for dose-ranging and efficacy confirmation. The trial is designed to identify the best overall dose of vitamin D supplementation and confirm the level of efficacy of that dose for fall prevention. Participants wil be community-dwelling adults, aged 70+ (~40% black, ~60% women), with a baseline serum 25(OH)D level of 10-29 ng/ml, who report at least one fall in the prior year.  After an initial pilt phase to evaluate recruitment strategies and finalize data collection procedures, participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 4 vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) test doses: 200IU, 1000IU, 2000IU and 4000IU/d. Participants will take their assigned pills for 2 years with extended follow-up off therapy for 1 more year. Stage 1 of this design will select the best dose of vitamin D for prevention of falls over a 6m follow-up period. Participants in the control (200IU) and best dose group will continue seamlessly into Stage 2 with additional recruitment and continued follow-up of all participants. The principal outcome (Stage 2) is time to first fall (or death) over 2 years f therapy. Secondary outcomes are fall rates, patterns of falling, gait speed, balance, muscle strength, frailty, SPPB score, and, in a sample of participants, 400m walk time and accelerometry. Falls will be ascertained from fall calendars completed daily by participants. Follow-up visits will occur at 3, 12, 24 and 36m. Subgroups with potential for differential benefit from vitamin D supplementation are pre- specified as: a) race (blacks vs others), b) baseline vitamin D levels (10-19 vs 20-29ng/ml), and c) frailty status (frail, pre-frail, not frail). Our prven capacity to recruit a diverse population, including large numbers of blacks, allows us to test the effects of vitamin D supplementation in key subgroups.  Strengths of the study include a team of interdisciplinary investigators who have vast experience and an exceptional track record in the design, conduct, analysis and dissemination of clinical trials, many of which have guided policy. The investigative team includes individuals with expertise in vitamin D metabolism, endocrinology, geriatrics, assessment of physical function and falls, biostatistics, epidemiology, central laboratory procedures, adaptive designs, community engagement, and recruitment. Building on our record in previous community-based trials, we expect that trial results will be timely, rigorous, and directly relevant to public health guidelines and will immediately influence fall prevention policies related to vitamin D supplementation in older persons.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vitamin D supplements might substantially reduce the risk of falls, potentially by more than 25%. The proposed study is a clinical trial that will determine the effects of 4 doses of vitamin D (200 IU/day, 1000 IU/day, 2000 IU/d and 4000 IIU/d) as a means to prevent falls in high-risk adults, ages 70 and older. Results of this trial will be directly relvant to public health and clinical guidelines, and will immediately influence policy.",

Supplementation of vitamin D and/or omega-3 has received attention as a potential anti-aging and cardio-protective strategy. Data from in vitro and animal models suggest that these nutrients are involved in the etiology of aging or behave like a biochemical 'Fountain of Youth' to mediate healthful aging. However, enthusiasm has outpaced the scientific evidence in humans, which is currently based on observational studies and small randomized clinical trials (RCTs) often with small doses. Large clinical trials with a high dose, daily dosing regimen,  adequate sample size and trial duration, and longitudinal assessment are urgently needed.  The principal function of telomeres is to protect the genome against chromosomal aberrations. Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is consistently shown to have a direct relationship with longevity, CVD and diabetes in epidemiologic studies, and is thus considered to be a biomarker of aging. What is more, LTL is relatively short in persons with chronic inflammation, which is considered to be part of CVD and diabetic risk. The on-going NIH funded VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) is a large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2 x 2 factorial trial of vitamin D3 (2,000 IU/day) and marine omega-3 fatty acid (ɯ-3 FA, 1 g/day) supplements among a representative sample of US men aged ≥50 years and women aged ≥55 years, with an oversampling of blacks. A unique feature of VITAL is the establishment of a sub-cohort of 1,054 participants who are evaluated in person at the Harvard Clinical and Translational Science Centre (CTSC) in Boston, which allows for in-clinic plasma/buffy coat sample collection and in-depth CVD phenotyping at baseline and Year 2. We propose to examine the effects of dietary vitamin D and/or                omega-3 supplementation on LTL attrition assessed longitudinally utilizing in-clinic buffy coat samples collected at baseline, Year 2, and Year 4. Thus, we will also investigate the effects of vitamin D and/or omega-3 supplementation on the longitudinal interrelationship of LTL trajectory, plasma inflammatory      cytokines, and CVD risk factors in the VITAL trial.  This proposal is in response to the information gaps/research needs identified by the most recent Institute of Medicine (IOM) Report on Dietary Reference Intakes. The IOM report identified the need for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of vitamin D for prevention of CVD, and cellular biology of vitamin D (e.g. cellular aging) as areas of high priority. The American Heart Association and the IOM recommend that all adults eat fish regularly to reduce risk for CVD. This novel and cost-effective study is expected to provide the information necessary to answer the open question of whether dietary vitamin D and/or omega-3 supplementation are beneficial for LTL shortening. Studies of telomeres will also open new avenues for the basic understanding of vitamin D and/or omega-3 as well as their preventive and therapeutic effects of CVD.          ","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Dietary supplementation of vitamin D and/or omega-3 has received attention as a potential anti-aging and cardio-protective strategy; however, enthusiasm has outpaced the scientific evidence in humans, and evidence at the population level remains inconclusive to inform nutritional recommendations. The urgent need has prompted us to propose this present study leveraging the infrastructure of the ongoing national trial called VITAL to examine the balance of their benefits and risks. Data obtained would serve to shape evidence-based dietary vitamin D/omega intake recommendations and guidelines in elderly people.          ",
"5","R01","NR015029-03","Bone Loading Exercises versus Risedronate on Bone Health in Post-Menopausal women","","30-Jun-2019","Bilek, Laura Diane; WALTMAN, NANCY L","UNITED STATES","691166","2016","NR","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 36 million American women have low bone mass (bone mineral density [BMD] T-scores -1 to -2.49) and are at very high risk for progression to osteoporosis (BMD T-scores -2.50 or lower) and fractures. Osteoporosis and fractures are major health problems in the U.S. with annual expenditures of $19 billion, and the problem is growing. Our goal is to provide nurses and the wider healthcare community best practice guidelines by contributing evidence as to whether a lifestyle intervention should be implemented for women with low bone mass prior to use of bisphosphonate (BP) medications. In this study, women with low bone mass in the first 5 years of menopause (a time of rapid and significant bone loss) will be randomized to 3 groups (n =103 per group): 1) optimal calcium + vitamin D (optimal CaD) alone (Control); 2) a BP plus optimal CaD (Risedronate); or 3) a three times weekly bone loading exercise program plus optimal CaD (Exercise). Adequate calcium and vitamin D are necessary for bone; however, they frequently are not enough to prevent progression of bone loss in post-menopausal women. Although BPs are indicated for women with osteoporosis, their use is controversial for women with early bone loss. One concern is that long-term use of BPs may increase risk for atypical hip and femur fractures. A bone loading exercise program promotes bone health by improving bone structure and bone formation at sites of mechanical stress as well as by preserving BMD. Comparing effectiveness of exercises with BPs is critical because this will determine whether standard practice should include a trial of exercises prior to BP prescriptions in this at risk population. If an effective exercise program could substitute for, or delay the use of BPs, not only would bone health improve throughout the lifespan, but women would benefit from the many other positive effects of exercise. Our central hypothesis is that after 12 months of participation, improvements in bone strength will be greater in subjects randomized to the Exercise group compared to subjects in either the Control or Risedronate groups. We believe that the best predictor of fracture is bone strength, and strength is determined by bone structure and turnover as well as BMD. Thus, outcomes will include changes in bone structure at the tibia and hip (pQCT and Hip Structural Analysis); BMD at the total hip, femoral neck, and spine; and serum markers of bone formation and resorption. Because adherence to exercises and risedronate may be difficult for subjects to accomplish, education, goal setting, graphic feedback, and targeted strategies for barrier reduction will be used to promote adherence. Dr. Nancy Waltman has over 15 years' experience and 14 publications on the impact of exercise on bone in post-menopausal women. With the addition of Dr. Bilek and other expert consultants and co-investigators, we believe we are well-qualified to conduct this study. Our proposal is consistent with the NINR strategic plan to support research for patient self-management, disease prevention, & application of new technology (Hip Structural Analysis and pQCT).","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Osteoporosis and fractures are major health care problems in postmenopausal women. To prevent fractures and strengthen bones, treatments for low bone mass should improve bone structure and increase bone formation at common sites of fractures as well as maintaining bone mineral density. This study will compare changes in bone strength (bone structure, formation, and bone mineral density) at the hip and spine in women who take 12 months of either: 1) optimal calcium and vitamin D alone; 2) the bisphosphonate 'risedronate' with calcium and vitamin D; or 3) a bone-loading exercise program with calcium and vitamin D.",

Two key concepts have underpinned this renewed interest in the health benefits of vitamin D. First is the continuing debate on the worldwide prevalence of vitamin D-insufficiency, and how optimal vitamin D status can be safely achieved through conventional exposure to sunlight and dietary intake. Second is the potential for vitamin D to promote health benefits beyond its classical effects on the skeleton. Following a recent data review, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) has issued statements aimed at addressing some of the key questions concerning our new perspective on vitamin D and human health. The Recommended Dietary Allowance of vitamin D for all age groups was elevated based on bone responses to vitamin D. However, the IOM report also recognized the need for further research to better define 'non-classical' health benefits of vitamin D. The long-term impact of these recommendations is crucially dependent on one question - how does one define vitamin D-sufficiency and -insufficiency? The proposed project describes a new paradigm for quantifying optimal vitamin D and its relation to human health. The overall aim is to demonstrate that vitamin D activity is not simply defined by total serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25D) but instead depends on the bioavailability of this metabolite to target cells and its subsequent conversion to active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D) via the enzyme 1�-hydroxylase (CYP27B1). The proposal hypothesizes that the ability of 25D to access target cells is influenced by its association with the serum vitamin D binding protein (DBP), with 'free' rather than 'DBP-bound' 25D being the bioactive form of this metabolite. The overall objective of the proposal will be to investigate the impact of DBP on the bioactivity of 25D using both mouse and human models. Studies using transgenic, knockout, and humanized mice will investigate how variations in the concentration and vitamin D metabolite binding affinity of DBP affect the response of these mice to 25D and 1,25D under conditions of vitamin D-sufficiency and -deficiency. Data from these experiments will then be related to studies in humans, where DBP concentration and binding affinity are strongly influenced by genetic variations in the DBP gene. Human studies will incorporate analysis of DBP and free 25D/1,25D in a large patient cohort with multiple measures of vitamin D function, but will also involve a pilot supplementation study utilizing parental vitamin D or 25D. These analyses will employ a new mathematical algorithm for determining serum free 25D and 1,25D and will use novel assay technology to physically measure serum levels of free 25D. This model not only puts forward a new paradigm for defining optimal vitamin D status but also aims to highlight a more 'personalized' perspective on vitamin D health that will incorporate both classical and non-classical actions of vitamin D.   .","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vitamin D has been linked to a wide range of human health benefits, but the optimal level of vitamin D required for these effects is far from clear. We have hypothesized that rather than simply measuring total serum concentrations of vitamin D, it is more biologically and clinically relevant to determine free or bioactive levels of serum vitamin D metabolites. To demonstrate this, the proposed project will utilize in vivo mouse and human models in which free serum vitamin D is altered as a consequence of variable expression of the serum vitamin D binding protein, with the overall aim of the project being to present an entirely new paradigm for defining optimal vitamin D status in humans. .",

ALD is an inherited paroxysmal disease characterized by fatty acid accumulation and subsequent oxidative stress. Forty percent of ALD boys develop inflammatory cerebral demyelination (cerALD) in their first decade of life. Unfortunately, we have no means of identifying boys at risk for cerALD nor do we have any means of preventing the onset of cerebral ALD. These limitations represent enormous gaps in our standard of care for these patients.  To address these limitations, the candidate and his collaborators consider the relationship of several key areas of current knowledge in cerALD: (1) ALD results from a peroxisomal gene defect that causes an accumulation of fatty acids which expose cells to lipid peroxides and other mediators of oxidative stress, (2) monocyte-lineage cells dominate the leading edge of the demyelinating lesions and (3) the lesions shares histologic features with multiple sclerosis lesions, a disease that has been linked to vitamin D insufficiency.  Armed with this knowledge, the candidate has generated preliminary data showing that (1) low serum 25-OH vitamin D levels predict the onset of cerALD; (2) monocytes and brain myelin in ALD males have low glutathione levels compared to controls; (3) the spinal fluid from cerebral ALD boys shows a cytokine expression profile consistent with oxidative stress in monocyte-lineage cells; and lastly, (4) that oral vitamin D3 supplementation in a murine model of autoimmune demyelination significantly reduces clinical disease and increases intracellular glutathione levels in monocytes.  The candidate proposes a pilot trial to study the effect of oral vitamin D3 supplementation on blood and brain biomarkers of oxidative stress in 20 ALD boys who have not yet developed cerebral ALD. In Aim 1 the candidate will use MRI techniques to monitor brain biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation in response to rising vitamin D levels. In Aim 2, the candidate will use 12-color flow cytometry and tandem mass spectrometry to study the effect of oral vitamin D3 supplementation on markers of oxidative stress in the specific immune cell subsets of study participants. In Aim 3, the candidate will use bio banked ALD monocytes to define the metabolic and immunologic pathways linking vitamin D exposure with glutathione and cytokine modulation. The candidate's long term goal is to develop treatments and biomarkers for the prevention of cerebral ALD. The addition of ALD to universal newborn screening panels in an increasing number of US states bolsters the project's immediate relevance.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) affects an estimated 1:17,000 individuals with men more severely affected than women. Nearly 40% of ALD boys develop severe inflammatory cerebral demyelination (cerebral ALD) during the first decade of life, a complication that is often fatal. There is no available treatment for preventing the onset f cerebral ALD. The proposed work expands on the candidate's observation that low pre- morbid serum vitamin D levels with later onset of cerebral ALD. It specifically examines the effect of ora vitamin D3 supplements on markers of oxidative stress in ALD boys. This has implications for the use of vitamin D3 supplements as a preventive therapy for cerebral ALD, which in turn has implications for newborn screening for ALD.",

Despite over 40 years of research on AH, there is still no FDA approved treatment for this disease. The most commonly used off-label drugs for AH are corticosteroids and pentoxifylline. Unfortunately, even patients with AH treated with corticosteroids have a 6 month mortality of 40%. These poor clinical outcomes are due, in large part, to an incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of alcohol-mediated liver injury. Therefore, there is an urgent need for effective new therapies for this pernicious disease. This multicenter study will be a collaborative effort of four medical centers (Cleveland Clinic, University of Louisville, UT Southwestern, and University of Massachusetts) with its ultimate goal of transforming the clinical treatment of AH by rapidly translating novel and innovative basic science discoveries into clinical practice. In the first 2.5 years of the grant, two clinical trials will test the hypohesis that disruption of the normal gut-barrier function, over-activation of the inflammatory cascade, and innate immune activation are the primary elements of the complex pathogenesis of AH. In patients with severe AH, the first trial will compare a novel drug combination of anakinra (an inhibitor of IL-1 activity), pentoxifylline (a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that suppresses the inflammatory cytokine cascade), and zinc (which improves gut-barrier function) with the current standard of care therapy of treatment with corticosteroids. The second trial will compare probiotics (to improve gut-barrier function) to placebo in patients with moderate AH. The primary outcomes of both clinical trials will be 6 month mortality. Both trials will also supply specimens o the translational/basic science components of this UO1 consortium to identify novel biomarkers and altered pharmacogenetics that predict disease severity and response to pharmacologic therapy as well as to identify unique drug targets for novel treatments for AH.

Translational studies between basic science and clinical testing have been lacking. There also have been limited trials of combination therapies even though AH has a complex pathophysiology involving multiple mechanisms of injury.

Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) has a high morbidity and mortality. In VA Cooperative Studies in which liver biopsies were performed, only 35% of patients with AH and underlying cirrhosis, and 60% of those with AH alone (no cirrhosis) were alive at the end of four years, with most deaths occurring early in the study. There is no FDA-approved therapy for any stage of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). The most widely-used (off-label) drug therapies for AH are glucocorticoids and pentoxifylline. Both agents have anti-inflammatory activities and downregulate proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Unfortunately, an important subset of AH patients treated with glucocorticoids have 'steroid resistance', and some patients have contraindications to steroid therapy. Studies on pentoxifylline in AH are limited, and efficacy appears highest in preventing/treating the hepatorenal syndrome. Thus, new therapies as well as a better understanding of mechanisms/biomarkers for severity of disease and response to therapy are necessary. Our research team has been a leader in defining mechanisms of alcohol-induced liver injury using in vitro and animal models of ALD, and in translating basic findings into the clinical setting. Our group is the first to describe dysregulated cytokine metabolism in AH. We have a long-standing interest in mechanisms of inflammation and liver injury.

While much research has focused on the dysmorphological and neurological features of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), there is a critical gap in the literature with regard to our understanding of the nutritional and immunological mechanisms whereby postnatal growth and performance deficits in children affected by alcohol are initiated and subsequently persist throughout childhood, and therefore might be targets for postnatal intervention. Based on preliminary data from an ongoing clinical trial in Ukraine, conducted in a sample of moderate to heavy alcohol-consuming pregnant women, a multimicronutrient supplementation (multiple-vitamin-mineral supplement with or without additional choline) given during pregnancy is associated with a marked reduction of alcohol-related growth and neurocognitive deficits in infants at 6 and 12 months of age. These promising initial findings could have worldwide public health impact if demonstrated to persist. The primary goal of the current application is to investigate the persistence of the beneficial effects of multimicronutrient supplementation on growth and development through preschool age in an established longitudinal sample of children in Ukraine.

Women first is a large mother-infant longitudinal birth cohort in the 3rd world (4 international sites) that is investigating whether timing of nutritional intervention can improve maternal and infant outcomes. This K01 award will examine one international site (Guatemala) that is prone to both growth stunting and obesity. My proposed research project will assess changes in DNA methylation in umbilical cord blood (UCB) from infants born to lean or obese mothers who consumed micronutrient supplementation (MNS) for ≥ 3 months prior to conception (Arm 1), MNS commenced at 12 wk gestation (Arm 2), or no supplementation (Arm 3) and offspring susceptibility for stunted growth (birth length) and obesity (weight-for-length Z-score). My primary hypothesis is that maternal nutritional and metabolic status, prior to conception, will result in differentially methylation regions (DMRs) in umbilical cord blood (UCB) associated with linear growth and susceptibility to obesity. Specifically, I propose 3 novel approaches to examine the effects of pre-conception MNS and pre-pregnancy BMI on the infant epigenome: SA1) Identification of differentially methylated regions using Roche - NimbleGen SeqCap Epi SA2) Assessing DNA methylation of newly identified obesity-associated metastable epialleles SA3) Use 2-step Mendelian Randomization to strengthen causal inference of my postulated pathway: Maternal MNS & pre-pregnancy BMI → ∆ DNA methylation → infant outcome (birth length & body weight)  Due to limited experience assessing epigenetics in large clinical cohorts, I have devised a specific training plan to acquire epigenetic, clinical, and analytical skills.

The results of the study and its corollary biomarker analyses will be used to guide development of a randomized Phase II placebo-controlled clinical trial to test the efficacy of LGG as a GI protective agent in this same population which is our long-term goal. In the US, cancer originating from the GI tract (rectum, pancreas, stomach and anal canal) is a significant clinical problem with over 110,000 new diagnoses each year. Successful completion of cytotoxic radiation therapy (RT) significantly improves outcomes and cure rates for patients with locally advanced gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies. Despite use of highly focused (RT), patients undergoing pelvic or abdominal RT are at high risk of diarrheal complications from collateral damage to small intestine. Combining RT with chemotherapy adds to the GI toxicity with symptoms that include diarrhea resulting in dehydration and hospitalization. These GI toxicities are a dose-limiting side-effect for cytotoxic therapy which is a significant clinical problem as it  leads to reduced efficacy of the cancer treatment regimen. There is currently an unmet need for agents that could protect the normal small intestinal epithelium from collateral damage whereby reducing symptoms of GI toxicity so that patients can receive optimal cancer therapy and a maximized quality of life. New evidence suggests that certain probiotic bacteria may be an innovative approach to reduce cytotoxic therapy-associated GI toxicity. Probiotic bacteria have been used safely as therapy in several GI conditions and offer the advantage of luminal delivery of a locally acting agent. These properties make probiotics a potentially ideal therapy to prevent collateral damage to the normal GI tract during cancer therapy. Using an established experimental model, we found that prophylactic administration of the probiotic LGG effectively reduced cell death and promoted epithelial recovery at doses relevant to humans. Our new preclinical data also indicate that this approach works in fractionated radiation dosing regimens similar to what humans receive during cancer therapy, but importantly does not impact tumor radiosensitivity. This data and detailed analysis of prior clinical trials from outside the US have  informed the development of our central hypothesis that 'Oral supplementation with the probiotic LGG will reduce treatment-related GI toxicity by protecting the intestinal epithelium in patients receiving cytotoxic therapy for gastrointestinal cancer.' Under FDA and IRB approved protocols we will address our central hypothesis to determine the safety and tolerability for LGG as an intestinal protectant in patients receiving RT for GI malignancy in a Phase I study. As a biovalidation aim, we will also establish how novel biomarkers correlate with clinical symptom indices of treatment related GI toxicity. If successful, the significance of this Phase I trial wil enable and guide the initiation of a multi-center, randomized Phase II study to evaluate LGG's efficacy as an intestinal cytoprotectant during therapy for GI malignancy.          ","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall goals of this application are to determine the safety and tolerability of the probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) when given to patients receiving chemoradiation for pelvic malignancies. Our studies have significant public health relevance in that injury to the normal small intestine is a major source of morbidity in patients receiving radiation therapy for pelvic malignancies. The development of LGG as a radioprotective agent would allow for decreased morbidity, particularly decreased diarrhea, in patients receiving radiation therapy for pelvic malignancies.

Gut-derived endotoxins normally penetrate the gut epithelium in only trace amounts due to tightly regulated intestinal barrier function. However, endotoxin leakiness is increased under pathological conditions, including alcohol abuse. The barrier function of intestinal epithelium Is provided in part by paracellular apical junction complexes, including tight and adherens junctions, and by a mucus layer.  In our initial systems biology approach to ALD, we found that intestinal trefoil factor (ITF) was by far the most altered (~50-fold down regulated) protein in the liver following chronic alcohol feeding in rats, and subsequent studies also showed marked down regulation of ITF mRNA and protein in the intestines of alcohol fed mice. ITF plays a critical role in the formation and stabilization of intestinal mucus barrier and enhancement of rapid intestinal repair 'restitution'. Formation and restitution ofthe barrier is also dependent on uninterrupted mucosal blood flow. Intestinal epithelial cells are positioned between an anaerobic lumen and a highly metabolic lamina propria forming a steep physiologic oxygen gradient. Increased hypoxia- inducible factor (HIF) signaling represents a major adaptive response to hypoxic stress by upregulating a variety of gene products, such as ITF and mucins, to form an integrated epithelial barrier. Our preliminary studies demonstrated that chronic alcohol administration decreases intestinal HIF-2a, ITF and tight junction protein expression resulting in increased endotoxemia and ultimately liver injury. Moreover, supplementation with a probiotic strain, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), increased intestinal HIF-2a and ITF expression, decreased endotoxemia and attenuated alcohol induced liver injury. We hypothesize that alcohol exposure causes detrimental metabolic changes favoring intestinal oxidative stress, inflammation, and alterations of HIF responsive signaling with decreased ITF, leading to intestinal barrier dysfunction, blood endotoxemia and ALD. We postulate that probiotic supplementation will attenuate alcohol-induced intestine and liver injury, in part by increasing HIF-mediated expression of mucus protective factors such as ITF in the intestine. We test our hypothesis with 4 specific aims using in vitro, animal, and human studies approaches. Our ultimate goal is the development of new therapies for ALD. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Alcohol overuse/abuse induces organ injury in multiple organs. This translational research project will examine the mechanisms of the beneficial effects of probiotics on the intestine and the liver in an experimental mouse model of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and in mild human alcoholic hepatitis (AH).","No data",

Reducing AAP linked metabolic risks may help cut the 30 years of life lost within this population. Supplemental folate may be a cost effective and low risk method to reduce AAP CVD morbidity and mortality. Folate pharmacogenetics, allows us to mechanistically study AAP metabolic complications and develop personalized medicine within clinical practice. The objective of this project is to compare the effect of folate versus placebo on measures of the metabolic syndrome and CVD risk factors. We will evaluate metabolic laboratory components, and endothelial functioning, in schizophrenia patients receiving AAPs, taking into account pharmacogenetic differences related to folate metabolism. Our primary hypothesis is that folate will attenuate metabolic changes associated with AAP use, thereby contributing to improve endothelial functioning. Variation within the genes facilitating folate metabolism (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and catechol-o-methyl transferase (COMT)) modulate these improvements. We have formulated this hypothesis based on our pilot data obtained during R01MH082784 showing AAPs increase metabolic syndrome risk due to an interaction with MTHFR and COMT. We performed an open-label 3-month folate supplement trial and found significant reductions in metabolic measures and significantly reduced the number of subjects meeting endothelial dysfunction criteria. These improvements were modulated through MTHFR and COMT. The specific aims for this proposal are: 1) Evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness of folic acid supplementation (5mg/day) versus placebo for 16 weeks in schizophrenia subjects and measure sustainability of this effect 8 weeks after supplementation withdrawal, 2) Determine the role of MTHFR and COMT variants on endothelial functioning and metabolic improvements seen with folate supplementation. The innovative approach capitalizes upon a novel strategy to reduce AAP metabolic risks using a novel non-invasive endothelial functioning measurement as a biomarker. This allows for an overall CVD risk estimation compared to focusing on solely weight loss and glucose regulation. The inclusion of pharmacogenomics allows for potential innovative translation of personalized medicine outcomes into practice. Our expected outcomes will demonstrate folate's effectiveness in attenuating metabolic syndrome measures and improvements in endothelial functioning in AAP users with a randomized double blind longitudinal treatment design. Our follow up visit will allow for measurement of any sustained folate effects leading to future dose ranging studies. Successful completion of our pharmacogenetic analyses can be expected to provide a greater mechanistic understanding of AAP metabolic risks. The primary positive impact of our anticipated findings will be an evidence-based scientific framework for folate intervention development for AAP metabolic complications, which can be directly translated into clinical practice.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health relevance of this proposed research is that its successful completion can be expected to provide a cost effective intervention that can be used to significantly reduce the risk of development of cardiovascular problems for patients taking antipsychotic medications to treat their serious mental illness.

This career training award would allow her to pursue formal training through a Master's degree in Clinical and Translational Research, with a focus on designing interventions and conducting clinical trials to improve maternal and neonatal outcomes in obese pregnancy. She will benefit from the experience of an expert mentoring team. Her primary mentor will be Dr. Simin Meydani, Professor of Nutrition and Immunology at Tufts University and a renowned expert in micronutrient intervention studies. Her co-mentors will be Dr. Marlene Goldman, an expert in antioxidant interventions and reproductive health, Dr. David Greenblatt, an expert in pharmacologic interventions and obesity and Dr. Norma Terrin, an expert in clinical trial design.

This trial is a logical extension of this previous work. Her central hypothesis is that obese pregnancy is characterized by an oxidant/anti-oxidant imbalance, which increases inflammation and adversely impacts maternal health and neonatal outcome. Restoring oxidant/anti-oxidant balance with a body mass index-based prenatal micronutrient supplement will decrease oxidative stress and inflammation and improve both maternal and neonatal outcomes in obese pregnancy.

In the first funding period (9/29/10-06/30/15), we completed baseline and early follow- up of depression outcomes among nearly 19,000 successfully randomized men and women, aged 50+ years (mean age=65y), who were eligible for incidence or recurrence of late-life depression; nearly 70% of participants have provided pre-randomization blood samples for nutrient biochemical assays. Furthermore, in the Clinical and Translational Science Center (CTSC) component, detailed phenotypic assessments were conducted among a subset of over 1,000 individuals who received in-person structured psychiatric diagnostic interviews, underwent neuropsychological testing, and provided data on dimensional measures of mood, well- being, and social and daily functioning. Finally, another landmark aspect of VITAL-DEP is its substantial racial and ethnic diversity: over 25% of participants are from minority racial and/or ethnic backgrounds, including 19% who are African American. Indeed, our first funding period aims emphasized potential differences in vitamin D response among African Americans, given high risk of low 25(OH)D in this group. However, late- breaking evidence indicates that bioavailable vitamin D is of greatest relevance to race/ethnic differences. In this 5-year renewal proposal, we expand upon what has been achieved in the first period - assembly of a unique trial cohort - and focus on the unprecedented scientific opportunities afforded by this RCT design. Our Primary Aims are: 1) to extend follow-up of mood to examine with high statistical power the long-term (up to 7 years) effects of vitamin D and marine omega-3 fatty acids on depression outcomes among all ~19,000 participants; 2) to examine with high power the impact of biochemical nutrients levels of vitamin D and omega- 3 fatty acids on depression outcomes as well as treatment interaction with baseline biochemical levels. Secondary Aims focus on two critical themes that our particular trial design is uniquely poised to address: 1) racial/ethnic differences in long-term treatment effects; 2) mechanisms, mediators and moderators of mood effects of vitamin D and fish oil in this diverse cohort. Specifically, in a sub-set of 2,000 participants, we will examine relations of bioavailable vitamin D to depression, with attention to race differences in outcomes. Further, among the entire eligible CTSC cohort, we will obtain pre- and post-randomization serum brain- derived neurotrophic factor and targeted plasma metabolite levels to examine biological paths involved in mood responses to vitamin D and fish oil treatment and to test whether biomarker change explains variation in treatment effects. Thus, this proposal not only will ensure comprehensive, definitive testing of the benefits of vitamin D and fish oil for late-life mood but also will inform specific mechanisms involved in a diverse sample.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Biologic and observational evidence supports potential mental health benefits of both vitamin D and marine omega-3 fatty acids.

In recent meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials in humans, daily aspirin use reduced incidence, metastasis and mortality from several common types of cancer, especially colorectal cancer. The mechanism(s) by which aspirin exerts an anticancer benefit is uncertain; numerous effects have been described involving both cyclooxygenase-dependent and -independent pathways. The goal of this research is to elucidate the key metabolic changes that are responsible for the anticancer effects of aspirin in humans using untargeted metabolomics analysis. Metabolomics, or global metabolite profiling, is an emerging discipline that has the potential to transform the study of pharmaceutical agents. Our innovative approach will use high-resolution mass spectroscopy to detect thousands of metabolites in blood plasma and normal colon mucosa biopsies that were collected from participants in the Aspirin/Folate Polyp Prevention Study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of aspirin and/or folic acid supplementation for the prevention of colorectal adenomas. Participants in the trial were assigned with equal probability to three aspirin treatment arms (placebo, 81 mg, or 325 mg daily). Over the three-year treatment period, 81 mg/day of aspirin reduced the risk of adenomas, whereas the 325 mg/day dose had less effect. The aims of the current proposal are to identify metabolomic signatures, including specific metabolites and metabolic pathways, that are associated with aspirin treatment in blood and normal colon mucosal tissue of participants after three years of randomized aspirin treatment; and then to assess the associations of these metabolic signatures with adenoma risk and whether they mediate the reductions in risk due to 81 mg/day aspirin treatment. We will prioritize metabolites for study by evaluating metabolite levels in patients from the placebo and treatment arms while controlling the false discovery rate, use correlation analysis to enhance identification of relevant metabolic modules associated with these prioritized metabolites, and apply pathway mapping with post-hoc application of ion dissociation spectroscopy to representative metabolites to confirm pathway identification. Because aspirin is a multifunctional drug that is thought to modify numerous pathways with potential roles in carcinogenesis, a global discovery-based metabolomics approach is the best way to identify its key activities. The public health significance of this work is substantial because understanding the mechanism of aspirin's anticancer effects is key to optimizing its use and to the development of novel drugs targeting the metabolic pathways identified.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  A critical gap in our understanding of the mechanistic basis for aspirin's anticancer effects will be addressed in the current research proposal.

Since vitamin D metabolites are often decreased in critical illness, we propose that deficiencies in the vitamin D axis may be risk factors for incident AKI, and that exogenous vitamin D metabolites may be novel therapeutic agents for AKI prevention. Our preliminary data support these hypotheses. We showed that patients with established AKI have decreased levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25D) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D) in association with elevated fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) levels; the latter is known to suppress both renal and extra-renal conversion of 25D to 1,25D. In further preliminary data, we recently published the results of a pilot RCT demonstrating that administration of a single 2 µg IV dose of 1,25D to critically il patients increases leukocyte mRNA expression of interleukin-10 (IL-10) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). These important antiinflammatory proteins prevent AKI in animal models.  In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will leverage an established ICU cohort to perform the first comprehensive, prospective study to investigate whether 25D, 1,25D, and FGF23 are independent risk factors for adverse renal outcomes among 200 critically ill patients with a high AKI event rate. Primary outcomes will include: incident AKI, assessed by serum creatinine; renal tubular injury, assessed by urinary NGAL and KIM- 1; and need for renal replacement therapy or death. In Aim 2 we will enroll 150 critically ill patients at risk of AKI into a three-arm, double-blind, randomied study of 25D, 1,25D, or placebo to test the effects of repeated doses of vitamin D metabolites on renal and immunomodulatory endpoints. We will test whether 25D and/or 1,25D attenuate incident kidney injury, assessed by time averaged levels of both serum creatinine and urinary NGAL and KIM-1. Further, we will test whether 25D and/or 1,25D increase monocyte mRNA expression of antiinflammatory targets IL-10, HO-1, HIF1a, and thrombomodulin, decrease monocyte mRNA expression of proinflammatory targets ICAM-1 and IL-6, and increase T regulatory (Treg) %, all of which attenuate kidney injury in animal models. Additionally, we will evaluate physiologic endpoints including plasma levels of FGF23 and monocyte mRNA expression of 1-a hydroxylase and 24-hydroxylase to elucidate whether peripheral conversion of 25D to 1,25D is impaired in critical illness.  By unifying a comprehensive, prospective clinical outcomes study and an innovative trial under one thematic umbrella, we will generate novel, clinically relevant insights into the emerging role of vitamin D metabolites in critical illness an AKI that could have important diagnostic and therapeutic implications.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Acute kidney injury is a devastating complication of critical illness. Vitamin D metabolites have important and potentially beneficial antiinflammatory effects, and vitamin D levels are often decreased in critical illness. Thus, we propose that deficiencies in the vitamin D axis may be risk factors for the development of acute kidney injury, and that administration of vitamin D metabolites may be novel therapeutic agents to prevent acute kidney injury among critically ill patients.",

Despite over 40 years of research on AH, there is still no FDA approved treatment for this disease. The most commonly used off-label drugs for AH are corticosteroids and pentoxifylline. Unfortunately, even patients with AH treated with corticosteroids have a 6 month mortality of 40%. These poor clinical outcomes are due, in large part, to an incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of alcohol-mediated liver injury. Therefore, there is an urgent need for effective new therapies for this pernicious disease. This multicenter study will be a collaborative effort of four medical centers (Cleveland Clinic, University of Louisville, UT Southwestern, and University of Massachusetts) with its ultimate goal of transforming the clinical treatment of AH by rapidly translating novel and innovative basic science discoveries into clinical practice. In the first 2.5 years of the grant, two clinical trials will test the hypohesis that disruption of the normal gut-barrier function, over-activation of the inflammatory cascade, and innate immune activation are the primary elements of the complex pathogenesis of AH. In patients with severe AH, the first trial will compare a novel drug combination of anakinra (an inhibitor of IL-1 activity), pentoxifylline (a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that suppresses the inflammatory cytokine cascade), and zinc (which improves gut-barrier function) with the current standard of care therapy of treatment with corticosteroids. The second trial will compare probiotics (to improve gut-barrier function) to placebo in patients with moderate AH. The primary outcomes of both clinical trials will be 6 month mortality. Both trials will also supply specimens o the translational/basic science components of this UO1 consortium to identify novel biomarkers and altered pharmacogenetics that predict disease severity and response to pharmacologic therapy as well as to identify unique drug targets for novel treatments for AH. These new discoveries will then be translated rapidly to clinical testing in the last 2.5 years of the grant.A biorepository of the collected clinical data and patient samples will also be established that will be an important national resource for transforming clinical practice for the treatment of AH.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Animal studies have increased the knowledge of mechanisms of alcohol induced liver injury. Despite this knowledge, the morbidity and mortality of AH has not improved and there remains a pressing need for new therapeutic strategies and prognostic indicators. Translational studies between basic science and clinical testing have been lacking. There also have been limited trials of combination therapies even though AH has a complex pathophysiology involving multiple mechanisms of injury. Therefore, the highly innovative therapies proposed in our clinical trials and the ability of this consortium to rapidly translate basic science approaches into clinical practice makes the grant highly relevant to the improved clinical care of patients with AH.",

Despite enthusiasm for the use of vitamin D for bone health, there are limited data on the effects of high-dose vitamin D supplements vs. placebo on bone health and body composition outcomes. Previous data support a positive relationship between 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH) D] levels and bone mineral density (BMD). However, results from clinical trials that test vitamin D supplementation alone on areal BMD (aBMD) are sparse and inconsistent, and it is not known whether vitamin D can prevent or reverse the structural deterioration characteristic of osteoporosis. Recent advances in bone imaging make it possible to assess volumetric BMD (vBMD), structure, and micro- architecture non-invasively with high-resolution peripheral computed tomography (HR-pQCT). In addition, observational studies show an inverse relationship between 25(OH) D levels and body mass index (BMI). Since vitamin D is stored in fat, new dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measures of adiposity can advance understanding of this relationship and determine whether or not supplemental vitamin D has effects on body composition. We propose an ancillary study to the NIH-sponsored, Vitamin D and OmegA-3 Trial (VITAL) (U01 CA138962), an ongoing, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol, 2000 IU/d) and/or marine omega-3 fatty acids (1 gm/d) in 20,000 men and women, to test the effects of vitamin D3 on BMD, geometry, architecture, and body composition. In a sub-cohort of 600 participants recruited from the NIH-sponsored Clinical and Translational Science Center (CTSC) in Boston, we seek to test the following hypotheses, with measures at baseline and year 2: Aim 1: High-dose vitamin D3 will (a) produce small increases in aBMD at the spine, hip, forearm and total body, as assessed by DXA and (b) improve balance of bone remodeling through decreases in bone turnover; Aim 2: High-dose vitamin D3 will improve: vBMD and bone structure and architecture at the distal radius and tibia, as assessed by HR-pQCT and bone strength estimates; Aim 3: High-dose vitamin D3 will result in lower (a) total body fat and fat mass index (FMI-fat mass/height2) and/or b) regional fat measures, as assessed by DXA. For each Aim, we will determine whether effects vary with (a) baseline 25(OH) D levels, (b) gender, (c) race/skin pigmentation, and (d) BMI or FMI. We will also define how the 25(OH) D levels corresponding to high-dose vitamin D supplementation affects these bone health and body composition outcomes. In order to complete pre-randomization testing in this sub-cohort, it is critical that this ancillary study be undertaken during the CTSC baseline visits, which begin December, 2011 and extend to early 2013. The proposed studies will provide positive or informative negative results about effects of vitamin D3 alone on bone health and body composition, and enhance understanding of the skeletal mechanisms through which vitamin D may affect fracture outcomes evaluated in a separate study (AR060574). Findings from this proposal will fill gaps in knowledge and inform clinical and public health recommendations.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purported health benefits of vitamin D are receiving wide attention in the medical literature and the popular press. While some data support a benefit of vitamin D on fracture reduction, there is no information on the effects of high-dose vitamin D on bone structure and architecture and the effects of adiposity on these relationships. Findings from these clinical studies including advanced imaging techniques will elucidate the role of vitamin D on bone mass, architecture and body composition in men and women enrolled in the VITAL study.",

The mortality in this group of patients is unacceptably high. A majority of the deaths are due to cardiovascular diseases, followed by infectious complications and protein-energy wasting. Strategies to reduce the mortality of MHD patients, including those directed at traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as statins, have largely been ineffective. Inflammation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and protein-energy wasting. Biomarkers of the inflammatory state such as       C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are elevated in MHD patients and are also robust predictors of cardiovascular events and mortality in this patient population. While anti-inflammatory interventions, especially specific anti-cytokin therapies have been used successfully to treat patients with inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, and while encouraging studies have been reported in improving glycemic control and beta cell function in type 2 diabetes, there are only limited studies using these interventions in MHD patients. Our investigative group has performed a series of studies investigating the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of a number of anti-inflammatory therapies in MHD patients, including Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), Fish Oil (EPA+DHA), Vitamin E (gamma-tocopherol), alpha lipoic acid (ALA) and CoEnyzme Q10 in studies ranging from 14 patients to 300 patients.

Low bone mineral density (BMD) in childhood increases the risk of early osteoporosis and bone fracture later in life, which has serious individual and societal implications due to the impaired mobility, the associated morbidity and even mortality in older adults. Our long-term goal is to identify vulnerable pediatri populations at risk for bone loss in order to improve their bone health through an early intervention. This study focuses on the prevention of bone loss that occurs in children and adolescents treated with hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for hematologic malignancies. An increase in bone resorption that occurs after HCT in these patients offers an opportunity for intervention with an anti-resorptive agent, yet no prospective studies have been performed that examine the effectiveness of any bisphosphonate or other anti-resorptive agent in pediatric HCT recipients. Therefore, we propose to conduct a prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial of calcium and vitamin D plus pamidronate versus calcium and vitamin D alone to prevent bone loss after pediatric HCT. The central hypothesis is that subjects treated with pamidronate and calcium and vitamin D (Pamidronate Group) will have higher bone mineral content (BMC) and BMD measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and by peripheral quantitative CT, respectively, at 1 year post-HCT than subjects receiving calcium and vitamin D alone (Control Group). The rationale for this study is that treatment with pamidronate at the time of peak bone resorption can prevent/reverse bone loss and have a positive long-term impact on bone health in pediatric HCT recipients. We will pursue three specific aims: 1) To determine the impact of calcium and vitamin D plus pamidronate versus calcium and vitamin D alone on BMC and BMD following HCT in 60 recipients aged 1-18 years at HCT; 2) To characterize the time course of changes in cytokine levels (IL-6, IL-7, TNF-a) associated with the activation of osteoclasts after HCT and their association with BMC and BMD; 3) To examine the sequence of changes in markers of bone turnover after HCT and their response to pamidronate treatment. The current study is innovative in that it is the first to prospectively evaluate the effects of an anti- resortive agent administered shortly after HCT on BMC and BMD in children. This study is expected to have an important positive impact on bone health in children and the field of pediatric endocrinology by providing much needed prospective data on the effectiveness of an anti-resorptive agent after pediatric HCT. The preventive intervention that this project seeks to examine is likely to have an impact on current clinical practice. While biomarkers of bone turnover have been used in adult studies, there is a striking paucity of data on the clinical applicability of these markers in children and adolescents. Evaluating changes in these markers and cytokines after HCT will provide insight into the underlying mechanisms of bone loss.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hematopoietic cell transplantation is being utilized for an increasing number of both malignant and non- malignant disorders and the overall success rates of the procedure continues to improve. Therefore we are now seeing more and more patients who are survivors, but also more who face the long-term consequences of this very intensive form of therapy. Low bone mineral density is increasingly being recognized as a common consequence of bone marrow transplantation. Since childhood and adolescence are critical time periods for establishing peak bone mass for the rest of the adult life, it is importat to intervene early to prevent bone loss and reduce the risk of early osteoporosis and fracture later in life, which can have a significant impact on functional outcomes, ability to work, as well as quality of life.",

Folic acid appears to protect against ASD especially in mothers and children who are genetically susceptible to inefficient folate-dependent one-carbon and methylation metabolism, but this finding needs replication. In addition to being essential for neurodevelopment, folate is a primary methyl-donor for methylation reactions, including DNA methylation. The time near conception is an especially critical period for adequate methyl supply during cycles of active demethylation and re-methylation of the genome during embryogenesis. Our preliminary data show that folic acid supplementation is associated with even greater reductions in ASD risk, by 75%, in younger siblings of children with ASD. In addition, we found DNA methylation differences associated with no maternal use of folic acid supplements in birth tissues (placenta and cord blood) for genes with nuclear regulatory and brain development functions that could have implications for ASD.  The goal of the proposed work is to leverage data and samples from mother-child pairs in two large prospective pregnancy cohorts of high-risk infant siblings to examine specific pathways for prevention of ASD through maternal dietary and supplemental folate intake. This work will build on previous studies by examining exposures collected prospectively, with more accuracy in terms of timing and dose. We will be first to examine whether other methyl-donor B-vitamins have associated effects. We will include information on dietary and supplemental folate and B-vitamin intake from validated instruments, and measurements from maternal first trimester serum, cord blood, and fetal placental tissue. We will examine folic acid interactions with genetic  susceptibility factors. Finally, we will increase understanding of the underlying mechanisms by identifying DNA methylation changes associated with folate status, and investigate whether these changes overlap with methylation patterns observed in autistic brains, using innovative methods, multiple platforms, and replication across tissue type and study population, to address challenges associated with DNA methylation measurement. Through completion of the proposed project, we will gain a better understanding of how strongly folic acid is associated with reduced risk of ASD in high-risk families, when intake is most associated and at what levels, how this association differs based on genetic susceptibility, and whether maternal folic acid intake alters DNA methylation profiles in ways that could decrease ASD risk. These findings will have great clinical and public health implications, informing autism prevention trial and ultimately changes in recommendations and policy.

However, the molecular mechanisms by which overnutrition generates obesity are not fully understood. We hypothesize that overnutrition causes mitochondrial dysfunction by leading to inhibitory protein acetylation. Nicotinamide riboside (NR) is a precursor of NAD and supplementation with NR has been shown to reduce weight gain and metabolic dysfunction observed in a mouse model of overnutrition. Analysis of the mechanisms by which NR prevents weight gain may elucidate the molecular mechanisms that cause obesity.  This proposal is linked to a parent study of NR supplementation in the context of overnutrition which includes both a mouse model and a randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study in human adults. The parent study will use mechanistic methods to evaluate the impact of NR supplementation on NAD metabolism in mice given overnutrition. In the human pilot study, the parent study will test the hypothesis that NR supplementation will prevent weight gain in humans in the context of overnutrition. The objective of this K01 proposal is to evaluate alterations in the NAD- targeted and global metabolome that accompany nicotinamide riboside (NR) supplementation in both mice and humans and correlate these metabolomic changes with outcomes (e.g., prevention of weight gain) in both the mouse mechanistic studies and the human clinical trial. The use of metabolomics in both the mouse and human study provides a unique opportunity to identify novel biomarkers of weight gain and NR supplementation and to link these biomarkers with clinically significant changes in NAD metabolism.  The first aim is to evaluate the impact of NR supplementation on the comprehensive NAD metabolome in accessible biological samples. We hypothesize that the NAD metabolome will demonstrate changes associated with increased NAD utilization by SIRT3, a mitochondrial protein deacetylase. We will use NAD-targeted metabolomic analyses of urine, blood and feces to evaluate alterations in NAD metabolism associated with NR supplementation.  The second aim will explore the impact of NR supplementation in a non-targeted metabolomic analysis. We hypothesize that NR may prevent weight gain by altering metabolic pathways involved in energy expenditure. We will use non-targeted metabolomic analyses and identify important metabolomic profile changes with single value decomposition-based approaches. The results of this project will shed light on the underlying molecular mechanisms that cause obesity and may identify mechanisms for preventing obesity in the context of overnutrition.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Obesity and overweight affect almost two thirds of Americans.

These co-morbidities have been linked to heightened inflammation and monocyte activation, but the etiology of this heightened activation/inflammation is not fully understood, but is partly due to gut epithelial barrier dysfunction and microbial translocation. Attempts at controlling inflammation, immune activation or microbial translocation in HIV+ treated subjects have been for the most part unsuccessful, and even treatment that have been successful (such as statins) have drug interactions and safety concerns, likely precluding their use in a large proportion of the HIV population. Safer strategies that could be more widely adopted are well needed. It has been estimated by the WHO that nearly two billion subjects may be zinc deficient in the developing countries. In the developed countries, prior to effective ART, zinc deficiency was prevalent in HIV-infected subjects, and had been independently linked to disease progression and to higher mortality. Unlike what is observed with most nutrients, the prevalence of zinc deficiency continues to be high, even in subjects on ART. For example, the Nutrition for Healthy Living study found that 38% of subjects on ART had zinc deficiency, and subjects in the upper quartiles of zinc levels had lower HIV-1 RNA levels than those in the lowest quartile. Thus far, there is a lack of data related to the contribution of zinc status to the heightened inflammation and monocyte activation in HIV. Also, the few available zinc-supplementation studies in HIV have been mostly in untreated or not optimally treated subjects, and no studies have assessed changes in inflammation markers after zinc supplementation in HIV+ subjects with virologic suppression on ART, a pertinent population to the current era of HIV infection where guidelines are calling for every HIV+ subject to be aggressively treated. In the R21 phase of the proposal, we will assess the prevalence of zinc deficiency in HIV-infected subjects on ART and compare it to that of a matched group of HIV negative controls. We will also study the relationships between zinc levels and systemic inflammation, innate immunity and gut epithelial barrier dysfunction. Lastly, we will conduct a pilot study testing two different doses of zinc supplementation in HIV-infected subjects on ART with documented zinc deficiency. This pilot trial will also explore whether this strategy may affect selected inflammation markers and will help guide the next phase of investigations. In the R33 phase, we will conduct a pilot randomized placebo-controlled study of zinc supplementation in HIV-infected subjects on ART with zinc deficiency, and we will assess whether zinc supplementation is safe and effective at increasing zinc levels, and whether it will affect different pathways involved in HIV-comorbidities, namely innate immunity, systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and gut epithelial barrier dysfunction. Our proposal should provide important mechanistic insights to inform us on the mechanism of action through which zinc may produce clinical benefit in the HIV+ population, and as such will provide the information necessary to develop a competitive full-scale clinical trial.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Despite the advent of safer HIV therapies, several comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes are more common in people living with HIV, and have been linked to heightened inflammation state. Zinc deficiency (or low zinc levels) has been associated with abnormal state of heightened inflammation and with altered gut barrier in the general population. Little is known about the frequency and consequences of zinc deficiency in people living with HIV despite the fact that this population is known to have high inflammation and abnormal gut barrier. We will measure zinc levels in a group of HIV positive individuals and a group of HIV negative controls, and we will explore whether zinc deficiency is associated with high inflammation and abnormal gut barrier in these groups. In addition, we will conduct a novel pilot trial to study the effect of zinc supplementatio to modulate inflammation and repair abnormal gut barrier. The results of this study should inform public health efforts to ameliorate the risk of comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease not only in HIV-infected subjects, but also in other conditions where inflammation is enhanced, such as rheumatoid arthritis.",

This proposal will assess interventions aimed at preventing CTIBL in postmenopausal breast cancer patients caused by aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy, which results in a 2- to 4-fold increase in bone loss and significantly increase fracture risk in this population. The research project will tet the efficacy of high-dose vitamin D supplementation plus a personalized weight-bearing exercise program to prevent CTIBL. Career Development Plan: Dr. Peppone's previous experience as an epidemiologist specializing in cancer, combined with his ongoing training as a clinical cancer control researcher, makes him well-suited to become a independent researcher with a focus on the pathogenesis and treatment of CTIBL. His training goals will expand upon his knowledge and are divided into three training aims: 1) to develop expertise in the biology, physiology, genetics, and measurement of CTIBL, 2) to gain experience as a PI in the design, conduct, and analysis of Phase II/III randomized controlled clinical trials, and 3) to gain experience in the testing and implementation of a nutritional supplement intervention (vitamin D) and behavioral interventions (exercise) for CTIBL. Dr. Gary Morrow, a leading cancer control researcher for the past thirty years, will serve as Dr. Peppone's principal senior mentor and offer guidance in the area of clinical trial conduct. Co-mentor Dr. Randy Rosier and Advisor Dr. Alissa Huston will provide expertise in the biology, physiology, and contributing factors of CTIBL. Co-mentor Dr. Mary Reid and Advisor Donald Trump offer experience in the efficacy and pharmacology of vitamin D for the management of CTIBL, while co-mentor Dr. Karen Mustian will train Dr. Peppone in the development and implementation of exercise interventions for CTIBL. Advisor Dr. Godfrey will provide training in genetic analysis and Advisor Dr. Heckler will offer statistical training. Research Plan: The proposed pilot RCT, based upon both biological plausibility and feasibility data, is a three-arm study that tests two interventions for the prevention of cancer-treatment-induced bone loss in 105 moderately vitamin D deficient (11-32 ng/ml) postmenopausal breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant AI therapy. The proposed clinical trial aims to evaluate the efficacy of: 1) high-dose vitamin D supplementation, 2) high-dose vitamin D supplementation plus an individually tailored home-based weight-bearing aerobic (walking) and progressive resistance exercise program, compared to 3) low-dose vitamin D supplementation on bone metabolism and bone mineral density. Data provided will support a more definitive phase III clinical trial and potentially inform the practice of evidence-based medicine for the treatment of CTIBL. Dr. Peppone will use the training and data obtained by this award to develop into an independent clinical researcher in the cancer control field.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer-treatment induced bone loss (CTIBL) rates for breast cancer patients receiving aromatase inhibitor therapy are up to 4 times greater than naturally occurring bone loss and result in a significantly increased fracture risk. Resultant fractures increase mortality and morbidity, and currently there are no evidence-based preventive measures for CTIBL.",

Vitamin D deficiency is widespread among HIV-infected adults and children. This is particularly alarming since there is a higher risk than the general population for complications like osteoporosis, non-AIDS-defining malignancies, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) - all diseases associated with vitamin D deficiency. It is not known how much vitamin D deficiency heightens the risk of complications like CVD, affects immune function and disease progression, or interferes with optimal treatment in the HIV population. The impact of vitamin D deficiency in the HIV population may be compounded even further since the etiology of HIV-related complications like CVD is thought to be related in part to inflammation and detrimental endothelial effects associated with chronic HIV infection-similar proposed mechanisms as vitamin D deficiency. Data suggest that optimal vitamin D status may be protective against these HIV-related complications, and optimizing vitamin D status with oral supplementation in HIV-infected individuals may improve the risk of HIV-related complications by decreasing inflammation and/or improving endothelial dysfunction, and may improve immune function even in individuals on antiretroviral therapy. Developing suitable repletion strategies is crucial to maximizing health status, particularly in HIV-infected children and young adults, where an opportunity exists for disease prevention. However, the best method of vitamin D repletion is not known, and data suggest that some antiretroviral medications interfere with vitamin D metabolism. Thus, we hypothesize that (1) optimizing vitamin D status to the current Institute of Medicine's (IOM) suggested 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration of e20 ng/mL improves CVD risk, inflammation, and CD4 cell counts in HIV-infected individuals, (2) increasing 25(OH)D concentrations to >30 ng/mL improves CVD risk and inflammation to a greater degree than increasing eto 20 ng/mL (the concentration some experts consider optimal for cardiovascular health), and (3) a 'high dose' of oral vitamin D is necessary to achieve 25(OH)D concentrations >30 ng/mL. These hypotheses will be addressed by determining the longitudinal relationships between serum 25(OH)D concentrations, carotid intima-media thickness, pulse wave velocity, pro-inflammatory biomarkers, and CD4 cell counts in HIV-infected children and young adults in a double-blinded, randomized-controlled trial of three different vitamin D dosing regimens given over 24 months in HIV-infected children and young adults (ages 10-25 years) with vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D <20 ng/mL). We will also evaluate the 25(OH)D concentrations from each arm after 6, 12, and 24 months of supplementation, in order to determine a dose-response relationship. These findings could have a sizable impact on health in this population, since vitamin D therapy is inexpensive and associated with few adverse side effects. The PI is an exceptional candidate who is a pediatric infectious diseases specialist with a proven research focus in the metabolic and cardiovascular complications of HIV. She is mentored by a committed, multidisciplinary team of senior investigators with extensive experience in both mentoring and in the research methodologies relevant to this proposal. Future training in all aspects of clinical research, cardiovascular disease risk assessment, and clinical nutrition is planned to facilitate the PI's development into a successful independent physician scientist.","In most studies, HIV-infected individuals have a higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency compared to uninfected individuals. Vitamin D deficiency may contribute to some of the long-term complications of HIV infection, such as cardiovascular disease and increased inflammation. This proposal will advance our understanding of whether correction of vitamin D deficiency affects the risk of these HIV-related complications and/or improves CD4 cell counts.",

Neural tube defects (NTDs) are among the most common and serious of all birth defects affecting 0.5-1 per 1,000 US newborns, yet their complex etiology remains poorly understood (Wallingford et al., 2013). It is well established that pre-pregnancy supplementation with folic acid can reduce the risk of NTDs, but the underlying mechanism of this beneficial effect is unclear. Approximately 30% of NTDs cannot be prevented by maternal periconceptional folate supplementation. Our preliminary data showed that rare mutations in planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway could increase the risk of NTDs, while mutagens such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were enriched in the placentas of NTDs fetuses/infants. We hypothesized that NTDs are caused by combinations of rare multiple mutations. Higher mutation rates results in a higher NTDs prevalence. It is possible that folic acid can prevent NTDs by reducing the mutation rate. Furthermore, we hypothesize that paternal supplementation with folic acid can further reduce NTD rates. We have a unique opportunity to evaluate folate supplement effect on mutation rate by leveraging previously collected biological samples from NTD patients and controls from several distinct cohorts. Additionally, we propose to use mouse models to better understand the relationship between folate and mutation rates in vivo. The results of this study will provide an explanation of how folate prevents NTDs, and will reveal novel pathways for intervention on folate-resistant NTDs. Hence, the successful completion of the proposed studies is likely to have substantial impact on our understanding of conditions that affect ~6% of births worldwide and constitute one of the major healthcare concerns for the youngest members of society.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Folic acid supplementation has proven to be an effective intervention in the prevention of neural tube defects (NTDs). Despite decades of investigation, it is far from clear how this beneficial effects is achieved, and why over 30% of remaining cases of NTDs are not folate responsive. We hypothesize that folic acid reduces the mutation rates, thereby limiting combinations of rare mutations that have been associated with increase NTD risks. We believe that paternal supplementation with folic acid can further reduce NTD prevalence. These hypotheses will be tested in human NTD samples as well as in newly developed mouse model systems.",

Heavy alcohol use and HIV infection are both causes of microbial translocation, the process by which bacterial products from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract leak across the GI membrane to the portal circulation. Microbial translocation causes immune activation leading to end organ damage. Alcohol can cause microbial translocation via zinc deficiency. Zinc deficiency is common among HIV+ heavy drinkers and linked to high mortality rates. Zinc supplementation is affordable, available, does not interfere with ART, and has minimal adverse drug reactions. In animal models zinc reduces ethanol associated microbial translocation. In human studies zinc slows HIV disease progression and reduces levels of inflammatory biomarkers which are strongly linked to mortality. Given zinc's potential efficacy we propose to conduct Zinc for INflammation and Chronic disease in HIV (ZINC HIV), a double-blinded randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of zinc supplementation vs. placebo among 250 HIV+ Russians, who are ART-naive at enrollment and have a recent history of heavy drinking. We will recruit most of our participants from the Russia cohort within the Uganda Russia Boston Alcohol Network for Alcohol Research Collaboration on HIV/AIDS (URBAN ARCH) Consortium study. Our specific aims will test the efficacy of zinc supplementation, compared to placebo to (1) improve markers of mortality as measured by the VACS index; (2) slow HIV disease progression as measured by CD4 cell count; (3) improve markers of AMI risk as measured by the Reynolds risk score; and (4) lower levels of microbial translocation and inflammation as measured by serum biomarkers. We hypothesize that as compared with placebo, patients receiving zinc supplementation will have significantly lower AMI and mortality risk as measured by the VACS index and Reynolds risk scores; higher CD4 cell counts; lower levels of biomarkers for microbial translocation and inflammation. Importantly, if our hypotheses are true, zinc supplementation could ultimately become a standard adjunctive therapy complementing alcohol interventions among HIV+ persons even in resource limited environments.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The combination of heavy alcohol consumption and HIV infection results in serious health problems and an increased risk of death. Although it is not exactly clear how alcohol and HIV do this, inflammation appears to play an important role. Zinc supplementation has anti-inflammatory properties. This study is designed to see if giving zinc supplementation to HIV infected people who are heavy drinkers reduces the risk of serious health problems and death.",

Despite the profound public health burden, there have been no clinical trials that have attempted to directly address the neurodevelopmental deficits that are so debilitating in FASD. Extensive pre- clinical work (Thomas et al. and others) has provided evidence that choline supplementation is effective in attenuating the neurodevelopmental deficits caused by prenatal alcohol exposure in animal models. Our group has taken the initial steps toward translating this work to humans with two randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled trials. We first conducted a pilot study to ensure the feasibility, tolerability, and safety of choline supplementation in 20 children with FASD (Fuglestad et al, 2013). Next, we completed a study of 40 additional participants with the goals of establishing a target dosage for young children, testing efficacy in the domain of memory, and determining a developmental window for choline's effects (detailed in `preliminary studies').  Briefly, our pilot data revealed that: 1. Children wih FASD consume insufficient dietary choline on average; 2. Choline supplementation was safe, tolerable and feasible for 2-5 year olds; 3. Supplementation for 9 months increased children's explicit memory performance relative to placebo; 4. Significant memory improvement was seen in 2-3 year olds but not 4-5 year olds. For 2-3 year olds, memory improvement was 21 percentage points in the choline arm compared to 2 percentage points in the placebo arm; 5. A dose ranging from 10-19 mg/kg was associated with the largest improvement in memory; 6. A very common single- nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs12325817), related to endogenous choline production, appears to moderate the efficacy of choline for children with FASD.  These findings directly inform the next study. Aim 1 involves evaluating a 19 mg/kg dose in 60 children with FASD, ages 2 to 5. This dosing scheme will optimize the neurocognitive benefits and further enhance tolerability of the intervention. In addition to continuing the evaluation of memory benefits from choline, Aim 2 adds measures of attention and executive function as possible additional targets. The NIH Toolbox Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test and the Executive Function Scale for Early Childhood (pilot-tested during our last study) have been added. Aim 3 adds a longitudinal component - it will evaluate 40 children in the period two years after treatment to determine the permanency of choline's effects. Lastly, Aim 4 will further examine the role of known SNPs in choline synthesis as moderators to the observed treatment effects.  In summary, the proposed study will continue the translation of choline's application - from experimental pre-clinical work to an evidence-based intervention for neurodevelopmental deficits in children with FASD.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is known to contribute to permanent brain damage in the child, yet there are no established treatments. We completed the first two studies of choline supplementation in human children: a feasibility study and a pilot efficacy study. The proposed study will continue that work, determining whether choline supplementation during a specific developmental window when the child's brain remains somewhat plastic is able to attenuate the deficits in thinking, memory, processing speed, and behavior that are common in children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and whether these changes are long- lasting.",

Existing therapies for CKD improve outcomes only modestly. Therapeutic strategies that target novel CKD-specific mechanisms of CVD and CKD progression are desperately needed to improve health. Disordered mineral metabolism is a nearly universal complication of CKD, regardless of its underlying etiology. An elevated level of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is the earliest manifestation of disordered mineral metabolism in CKD. FGF23 rises in response to high phosphate diets and in states of impaired phosphate excretion, such as CKD. Rising FGF23 in CKD maintains normal serum phosphate, but also inhibits renal calcitriol production, which causes secondary hyperparathyroidism, and reduces klotho expression, which accelerates arterial calcification. Elevated FGF23 powerfully predicts ESRD, CVD events and death, and data from our group, validated by new preliminary data, suggest potential underlying pathogenic mechanisms: FGF23 induces left ventricular hypertrophy and accelerates CKD progression, and phosphate excess and klotho deficiency induce arterial calcification independent of FGF23.   Based on these data, FGF23 excess and disordered mineral metabolism are leading candidates to target in an outcomes trial. Our long-term goal is to prove by randomized trial that treatment of FGF23 excess and disordered mineral metabolism with phosphate binders, dietary phosphate manipulation, and active vitamin D, will reduce risks of ESRD, CVD events and death in CKD stages 3-4. In this Clinical Center application, we propose two pilot studies to fill remaining knowledge gaps that will inform the design of an outcomes trial. In Pilot Study 1, we will conduct a 6-month, randomized, 3 x 2 study of 150 CKD stage 3-4 patients of lanthanum versus sevelamer versus. placebo, alone and combined with dietary phosphate manipulation to compare their effects on FGF23, phosphate and other mineral metabolites. The results will define which binder should be advanced to an outcomes trial, and whether it should be accompanied by a dietary intervention. In Pilot Study 2, we will conduct a 12-month, randomized, 2 x 2 study of the 'winning' phosphate binder + diet arm in Pilot Study 1 versus placebo, and calcitriol vs. placebo in 220 CKD stage 3-4 patients to test the hypothesis that combining active  therapies will synergistically improve surrogate markers of CVD and renal risk. A decade of work in the field and extensive preliminary data support our hypotheses. Our team has the requisite clinical research expertise in FGF23 and vitamin D to complete these studies. The University of Miami has a track record of recruiting minority participants in multi-center trials, which is critical in diseases that disproportionately affect minorities, such as CKD.  Backed by a strong institutional environment energized by a new CTSA award, our participation in the U01 Consortium will enrich the diversity of study populations it recruits and allow us to contribute to the collaborative effort aimed at improving dismal clinical outcomes suffered by millions of patients with CKD.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  A high circulating level of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is the earliest manifestation of disordered bone  and mineral metabolism in chronic kidney disease, and it is a powerful risk factor for kidney failure,  cardiovascular disease and death.  The current application will investigate strategies to lower FGF23 levels in  pilot studies of patients with chronic kidney disease.  The results will inform the design of a future larger trial o  test whether these strategies can improve patients' clinical outcomes.",

Dr. Besecker utilizes both an in vitro and murine in vivo model for her zinc-related phagocytosis studies. She has also conducted two observational studies evaluating zinc's relation to the severity of illness and mortality in critically ill septi patients. Dr. Besecker's short term goal is to obtain training in both immunobiology specific to innate immunity/ bacterial clearance and clinical research design and implementation to allow her to transition to an independent translational researcher in the areas of zinc immunobiology and sepsis. A longer term goal is to develop and lead a translational, multi-center research program that focuses on optimizing nutrition to improve patient outcomes in the critically ill. Support from a K23 Mentored Career Development Award would provide the foundation to attain these goals. Career Development: Dr. Besecker's career development/ training will cover 4 Core Areas and include: 1) Laboratory techniques- flow cytometry and animal surgery; 2) Design and management of interventional clinical trials; 3) Project Management/ Organization of Research Programs; 4) Core Knowledge- immunobiology, pharmacology, and biostatistics.

VITAL-DED proposes to study the efficacy of marine omega-3 fatty acid (FA) supplementation for the prevention of DED, as well as the long-term amelioration of its associated chronic ocular surface pain and quality of life impacts, which include problems reading and driving. The study will leverage invaluable resources and data from the VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL, 1U01CA138962), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2x2 factorial trial to test marine omega-3 FA (465 mg/d eicosapentaenoic acid + 375 mg/d docosahexaenoic acid) and vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol, 2000 IU/d) supplements in the primary prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease among 20,000 men and women aged >50 y & >55 y, respectively. Beginning in July 2011 and continuing throughout 2012, willing and eligible respondents to an invitational mailing will be enrolled in a  month run-in, and subsequently those who remain willing, eligible, and compliant during the run-in will be randomly assigned to omega-3 FA or a matching placebo and vitamin D3 or a matching placebo. At 1-year intervals, participants will receive a new supply of pills and a follow up questionnaire on compliance, side effects, and incidence of health endpoints. We propose to ascertain prevalent (pre-randomization) and incident (post-randomization) DED endpoints in the VITAL trail. The primary Specific Aims of VITAL-DED are to test whether omega-3 FA supplementation: 1) reduces the incidence of DED, 2) improves the natural history of DED by relieving symptoms and other impacts on quality of life. Secondary Aims will estimate the incidence of DED in the US, prospectively examine the natural history of DED, explore factors that could modify or influence the impact of omega-3 FA supplementation, evaluate the inter-relationship of DED and depression, and test for possible independent or joint effects of vitamin D3 supplementation in the incidence and natural history of DED. This research is responsive to a program priority of the National Eye Institute's Strategic Plan to improve our understanding of and develop preventive strategies for inflammatory corneal and ocular surface diseases; and also addresses several issues identified in the recent 2010 NEI Workshop on Ocular Pain and Sensitivity. The hypotheses are supported by a compelling biological rationale and strong preliminary data from our prior epidemiological studies, as well as from laboratory investigations and small randomized trials, which suggest that omega-3 FA supplementation, could prevent DED and improve its natural history. We believe the timely start of VITAL-DED offers a unique but time-sensitive opportunity to obtain a reliable, efficient, and informative evaluation of the efficacy of the most promising preventive agent for DED. Given our success with prior large simple trials, our experience with DED, and our proposed methodology, we think VITAL-DED will provide definitive results to guide public health and clinical recommendations for DED prevention and management.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to accelerate the identification and availability of a safe and effective strategy to prevent dry eye disease (DED) and improve its natural history. This is important because DED is very common among older Americans, causing chronic ocular pain, an increased risk of infection, and problems with activities such as reading and driving. Existing evidence points to omega-3 fatty acids as the most promising agent to test for DED prevention and therapy, and we will take advantage of the incomparable opportunity offered by the VITAL trial (VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL), a large randomized trial of 20,000 older men and women to evaluate whether a supplement of omega-3 fatty acids versus a placebo can prevent DED and improve people's quality of life.",

Several randomized clinical trials of the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in reducing blood pressure have been conducted with mixed results. These inconsistent clinical trial findings may be explained by the substantial inter-individual variabiliy in the ability of a given vitamin D dose to raise circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations and, thus, to influence vitamin D-related outcomes. This variability is influenced by genetic variants. However, these variants have not been used to guide the dose of vitamin D supplementation. Our long-term goal is to use Genotype-gUIded vitamin D supplEmentation (GUIDE) to improve vitamin D-related health outcomes. The objective of this application is to conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of daily oral vitamin D3 for three months in 558 healthy participants between the ages of 30 and 70 from an existing population-based study. The vitamin D3 dose will be determined by the number of risk alleles in two vitamin D- related genes.

Low-grade chronic inflammation is a modifiable risk factor. However, it is unknown whether interventions that reduce the levels of inflammatory markers per se improve mobility, or avert decline in mobility in older persons.  To address this gap in evidence we propose the randomized clinical trial ENRGISE (ENabling Reduction of low-Grade Inflammation in SEniors) to test the ability of anti-inflammatory interventions for preventing major mobility disability by improving or preserving walking ability. We have maximized the public health impact of our proposed interventions by selecting interventions that are safe, tolerable, acceptable, and affordable for vulnerable older persons. Based on an extensive literature review, we propose to test the efficacy vs. placebo of the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in the form of fish oil, alone and in combination. Both angiotensin receptor blockers and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have shown to reduce IL-6 in clinical trials and preliminary data suggest that they may improve physical function.  We plan to recruit older persons who are at risk for, or with, mobility impairment, as measured by slow gait speed and self-reported mobility difficulty, and who have elevated levels of IL-6, the marker most consistently associated with mobility limitations. Preliminary data regarding feasibility need to be gathered before such a tria can be effectively designed and implemented. We propose to conduct a feasibility phase that includes performing meta-analyses of existing trials and cohorts, and conducting a pilot trial to assess the effects of the interventions on several inflammatory markers and walking speed. This will allow us to refine the design, recruitment yields, target population, adherence, retention, tolerability, sample-size, and cost for the main ENRGISE trial. We will assemble the multicenter research infrastructure needed for the ENRGISE pilot and main trials, including the biorepository, and we will develop the materials needed for implementing the trials, including the protocol, manual of operations, data and safety monitoring plan, forms, quality control and quality assurance plan, and recruitment and retention materials.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ENRGISE will address critical public health issues regarding mobility disability prevention. We will test the anti- inflammatory effects of widely available and affordable interventions and their impact on mobility in a highly vulnerable population, older adults with elevated levels of inflammation and slow gait speed, at risk of mobility disability.",

Her research is focused on the extra-skeletal actions of vitamin D and the unique challenges of managing vitamin D deficiency in patients with glomerular diseases complicated by nephrotic-range proteinuria. Vitamin D deficiency may be an important modifiable risk factor for renal disease progression and complications in these patients. Many small studies documented very low total 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels in nephrotic patients, but the underlying pathophysiology is poorly understood. Further, the safety and efficacy of supplementation in this sizeable patient population must be determined in order to prevent both potential toxicity and under-treatment. The candidate's preliminary work demonstrated that glomerular disease, particularly focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), was an independent risk factor for low total and free 25(OH) D levels and vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) in children with chronic kidney disease. These findings implicate impaired tubular reabsorption of 25(OH) D-DBP complexes and/or increased vitamin D catabolism. The proposed project comprises: (1) an ancillary cross-sectional study of 450 participants in the NIH-funded Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE) and (2) a pilot study of cholecalciferol supplementation in 35 children and young adults with FSGS. Leveraging NEPTUNE's unique repository of standardized histopathology data, this work will be the first to determine the association between tubulointerstitial injury an vitamin D metabolites and to delineate the impact of fibroblast growth factor 23-promoted catabolism on vitamin D levels in these patients. The supplementation study will address the safety and efficacy of calciferol supplementation in proteinuric FSGS patients and use novel translational measures of innate immunity and intra-renal inflammation to assess the response to supplementation. The findings of this work will be critical to the design and conduct of subsequent vitamin D trials, and to the development of supplementation guidelines. The candidate's comprehensive career development plan includes didactic training in clinical trials and immunology, and mentorship by leaders in epidemiology, biostatistics, nephrology and immunology. She will draw on outstanding resources including the CHOP Research Institute and CTSA, the Center for Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, and NEPTUNE. Her short-term goals are to: (1) dedicate 75% effort to this research and training program; (2) subsequently compete for NIH funds to support a trial of vitamin D supplementation and its impact on immune function and infectious complications in patients with glomerular diseases; and (3) expand the NEPTUNE study to relate baseline vitamin D levels and measures of mineral metabolism to cardiovascular disease, infections and renal disease progression. Her long-term goal is to lead an NIH-funded translational research program in children and adults with glomerular disease, with an emphasis on interventions to reduce complications and disease progression in this high-risk population.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to a variety of adverse health outcomes. Nephrotic patients have very low vitamin D levels, and the underlying mechanisms are not known. Furthermore, approaches to safely and effectively supplement vitamin D in these patients have not been established. The insights gained from this study are necessary to inform subsequent trials of vitamin D therapy to improve outcomes and develop unique supplementation guidelines for children and adults with diseases complicated by nephrotic syndrome.",

Evidence for a role of these agents in preventing cancer, CVD, and other diseases remains inconclusive regarding causality and insufficient to inform nutritional recommendations for primary prevention. Appropriately designed randomized trials in general populations are lacking. To fill this knowledge gap, we have been conducting VITAL, a highly innovative, cost-efficient, large-scale, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical tria among 26,000 U.S. men and women without cancer or CVD at baseline, who have been selected only on age (men aged e50 and women aged e55), with an oversampling of blacks (ne5000). In a 2x2 factorial design, participants have been randomized to vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol, 2000 IU/d) and marine omega-3 fatty acids (Omacor(R) fish oil, 1 g/d, containing eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] + docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) supplements (or placebos) independently. Contingent on continued funding, the median treatment period will be 5 years. During the first cycle, we have successfully met or surpassed our recruitment goals, enrolled a racially/ethnically diverse cohort, collected baseline blood/DNA samples on >16,000 participants (with plans for follow-up bloods in 6000), and conducted extensive validation studies of the laboratory assays for vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid measurements in the trial. Annual follow-up questionnaires assess treatment compliance (confirmed by blood samples in a subset of participants), side effects, endpoint occurrence, and cancer and vascular risk factors. Self-reported endpoints are confirmed by medical record review by physicians blinded to treatment assignment, and deaths are ascertained through the National Death Index-Plus and other sources. Our archived blood samples allow assessment of effect modification by baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid levels, changes in biomarkers over time, and testing of genetic/biochemical hypotheses. With our scientific colleagues, we have obtained funding for 18 ancillary studies to evaluate the role of these supplements in preventing other chronic diseases (including diabetes, cognitive decline, depression, and autoimmune disorders), and established an in-clinic component for in-depth phenotyping of a subcohort (n=1000). The trial is expected to provide either definitive positive or informative null results for our primary hypotheses and will serve as a national resource for research on the health effects of vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids, with opportunities for extensive collaborations. This is a high-impact trial due to the potential for major clinical and public health implications of the findings.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purported health benefits of vitamin D and marine omega-3 fatty acids continue to receive much attention in the medical literature and the popular press.

Infrastructure support is needed to accrue an additional 2,700 new cancer cases over the next five years to accomplish the overall goal of conducting innovative research that evaluates how environmental and lifestyle exposures, and genetic susceptibility together affect cancer incidence, mortality and aging-related outcomes. In addition to collecting questionnaire information, these two Asian cohorts include an established biorepository with blood, buccal and urine samples from more than 50,000 participants. With the vigorous follow-up procedures in place, only 1.5 percent of the original cohort participants have been lost to follow-up. To date, approximately 17 percent of the cohort members were diagnosed with incident cancers; approximately 50 percent of the cancer patients have stored biospecimens. Researches evaluating the unique environmental and lifestyle exposures of the Asian cohort study populations have provided novel findings that contributed to the field of cancer etiology and prevention. These novel findings in part provided the rationale for our current chemoprevention trials in U.S. populations. During the next 5-year study period, we propose to: (1) Conduct core infrastructure activities to maintain and enhance the two Asian cohort databases, including: (a) follow-up for cancer, non-cancer and death outcomes, (b) maintenance of the biorepositories, and (c) management of the databases; (2) Conduct in-person and telephone interviews among cohort participants to update exposure and medical information; (3) Collect blood and urine samples from cohort participants with cancer diagnoses; and (4) Engage in collaborative research projects of the NCI and Asian Consortium Consortia. We anticipate that the established resources of the two Asian cohorts will become even more scientifically valuable over the next five years as the younger members of the cohorts enter into the age of maximal cancer incidence, thereby increasing the number of pre-disease biomarker-based research projects.        RELEVANCE: We are requesting infrastructure support for two established, population-based cancer epidemiology cohorts among Chinese men and women. The unique exposures and cancer risl< profiles of the Asian cohorts have been essential to identifying the protective effect of specific dietary factors on cancer risk.

There is currently no effective treatment. Sirtuin 1 is upregulated in the kidney i murine models of PKD and acts as a deacetylase of retinoblastoma protein (Rb, leading to its phosphorylation) and p53, which together drive uncontrolled epithelial proliferation and cystogenesis. Inhibition of SIRT1 with nicotinamide, a component of vitamin B3, retards progression of PKD in mice. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that nicotinamide can inhibit SIRT1 deacetylase activity and safely and effectively retard cyst enlargement and disease progression in patients with PKD. Nicotinamide is a particularly attractive candidate for treatment of PKD because it has a well-established safety profile and, as a nutritional supplement, it does not require FDA approval. Thus, if it can be proven to be effective, PKD patients would have access to its use immediately.  The goal of this pilot study is to provide initial estimates of the biological and clinical efficacy of nicotinamide in patients with PKD. The resulting estimates will provide critical information to determine if we can detect any hint of a beneficial clinical effect on cyst progression and provide a plausible range of effect sizes for th design of a subsequent, larger, confirmatory trial. We propose to enroll 30 adult subjects with PKD in a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of nicotinamide, 30 mg/kg/d orally. Our specific aims are to estimate the effect of nicotinamide on: 1) SIRT1 deacetylase activity, and 2) biomarkers of PKD progression. To measure SIRT1 activity, peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be isolated and acetylated and total p53, and phosphorylated and total Rb will be measured by ELISA. To monitor PKD progression, MRI of the kidneys will be performed to determine total kidney volume, kidney pain will be measured with a questionnaire, and urine MCP1, KIM1, NGAL and other biomarkers will be measured.  Positive outcomes in this pilot study would lay the groundwork for a larger confirmatory trial that could definitively tst whether nicotinamide ameliorates disease progression in individuals with PKD.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Polycystic kidney disease is a common genetic disorder that causes kidney failure. We propose to perform a pilot clinical trial to test nicotinamide, a component of vitamin B3, as a treatment for polycystic kidney disease.

Vitamin D can influence the regulation of genes responsible for metabolism and transport processes that mediate xenobiotic clearance. This is highly relevant since vitamin D treatment is common, as deficiency (total 25(OH)D level <30 ng/mL) is observed in up to 90% of CKD cohorts. Previous published research by the Principal Investigators and others has shown that renal and nonrenal xenobiotic clearance pathways mediated by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and transporters is altered in CKD. Given the 24 M US citizens with CKD are prescribed an average of 10-12 different medications daily, the clinical realities of altered xenobiotic clearance in CKD (drug interactions, side effects, altered efficacy, and confusion for clinicians prescribing and/or monitoring treatments) are not trivial. Importantly, increasing evidence indicates that vitamin D deficiency is a significant non-traditional cardiovascular risk factor, and vitamin D is important or bone and musculoskeletal health, kidney protection, cancer prevention, and decreased severity or risk of autoimmune and infectious diseases. In this proposal, we developed a translational study employing in vivo and in vitro studies to investigate how vitamin D alters the activity of drug metabolism and transport pathways in CKD. We propose to characterize the in vivo activity of xenobiotic metabolism and transport pathways in CKD patients and healthy controls under the opposing influences of vitamin D deficiency and repletion. Moreover, physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models will explore mechanisms for vitamin D and uremia on variations in drug metabolism and transport using data derived from the planned in vivo and in vitro studies. Our central hypothesis is that vitamin D status independently affects metabolism and transport function in CKD patients. An over-arching goal of this proposal is to make drug therapies safer and more effective to reduce the significant morbidity and mortality in patients with CKD. Three independent Specific Aims comprised of in vivo and in vitro studies were formulated to address the key hypotheses: 1) The in vivo function of individual pathways of xenobiotic metabolism and transport are affected by vitamin D status and by CKD, 2) CKD alters the activity of individual CYPs responsible for vitamin D metabolism, leading to modified pharmacokinetics of cholecalciferol, and 3) Vitamin D treatment and simulated CKD differentially alter the expression and function of drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters in kidney and liver cells. These studies will be central to determine where more scrutiny is warranted in evaluating clinical risks for drug interactions, altered efficacy and toxicity of therapies, and for guidance on appropriate vitamin D deficiency and maintenance regimens. Long term benefits of this research are improvements in medication management, drug dosing guidelines, and corresponding outcomes in targeted organs and/or diseases for vitamin D treated patients. The proposed research would have high impact through the public health benefit of improving care provided to CKD patients, serving as a basis for future study of alterations in drug metabolism and transport, and provision of much needed information on vitamin D metabolism and pharmacokinetics in CKD.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patients with chronic kidney disease have alterations in the way the body handles medications. There is also a high rate of vitamin D deficiency among chronic kidney disease patients. We plan to study how vitamin D affects the metabolism and transport of medications and how vitamin D is metabolized in the body of patients with kidney disease.",

Patients will be randomly allocated (1:1) to receive either chelation + OMVM or double placebo and followed for clinical events until the end of the 5 year trial. The primary endpoint will be a composite of all-cause mortality, recurrent MI, stroke, coronary revascularization, and hospitalization for unstable angina.

Recent findings from the Physicians’ Health Study II, the only large-scale clinical trial of a daily multivitamin, indicated a significant reduction in cataract, but an elevated, though statistically non-significant, increased risk of AMD. These findings in men require confirmation in other men and extension to women. The proposed study will utilize resources and data from the COcoa-Supplement and Multivitamins Outcomes Study (COSMOS), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2x2 factorial trial testing a patented, high-quality cocoa extract supplement (Mars Symbioscience) and Centrum Silver multivitamin (Pfizer) in the prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer among 12,000 women aged ≥65 years and 6,000 men aged ≥60 years with 4 years of treatment and follow-up. Woman participants will be drawn from the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) cohort, and male participants will be drawn from a target population screened for participation (but not randomized) in the VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL). Beginning in June, 2015 and continuing through 2016, willing and eligible respondents to an invitational mailing will be enrolled in a 3-month run-in. Those who demonstrate good compliance with pill taking during the run-in, and remain willing and eligible, will be randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups for 5 years. At 1-year intervals, participants will receive a new supply of pills and a follow-up questionnaire on compliance, possible side effects, and incidence of endpoints. We propose to document incident cataract and prevalent and incident AMD endpoints in the COSMOS cohort in order to evaluate the efficacy of multivitamin and cocoa extract supplements in cataract and AMD prevention. The primary aims of the proposed study are to test whether 1) a daily multivitamin will reduce the risk of cataract; 2) a daily multivitamin will reduce the risk of total AMD events, a composite of incident AMD plus cases of progression to advanced AMD (neovascular AMD plus central geographic atrophy) among participants with prevalent AMD at baseline. The effect of cocoa extract supplements (capsule containing 750 mg/d flavanols, including 75 mg (-)-epicatechin, and 90 mg theobromine) in reducing risks of AMD and cataract will be examined as secondary aims. This research is responsive to a program priority of the National Eye Institute’s Strategic Plan to improve diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of eye disease. We believe the proposed eye disease ancillary to COSMOS offers a unique opportunity to obtain a reliable, efficient, and informative evaluation of the efficacy of two extremely promising preventive agents for cataract and AMD at a fraction of the cost of separate trials.","PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite the wide-spread usage of multivitamin supplements, and the growing enthusiasm for cocoa supplements, definitive data on the balance of risks and benefits of these agents are lacking. Data from this large-scale randomized trial should clarify the role of multivitamin and cocoa supplements in the prevention of cataract and AMD, two leading causes of visual impairment in US men and women.",

As aGvHD is responsible for nearly 20% of deaths following alloHCT, the need for better prevention and therapy for aGvHD is readily apparent. Involvement of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract in the pathogenesis of aGvHD has been substantiated by the translation of pre-clinical and clinical studies. Emerging evidence suggests that perturbations in the microbiota diversity result in aberrant systemic immune response as well as pathogen colonization and mucosal invasion, fostering the development of GvHD. Pre-clinical studies also suggest that replenishing commensals like Lactobacillus prior to HCT substantially decrease GvHD severity and intestinal insult. Our pilot data suggest that probiotics are safe to administer prior to and during children and adolescents undergoing HCT (IND#108,977). This proposal is a double-blind, randomized, multi-center intervention trial to evaluate the specific effect of probiotics in preventing GI aGvHD and more generally the effects on overall GvHD severity. The proposal is an approved concept of Children’s Oncology Group’s (COG), a NCI National Clinical Trial Network group. The study will be conducted through COG using its clinical research infrastructure. Correlative laboratory studies (plasma and stool analysis) will be performed in order to elucidate the mechanisms of action of probiotic therapy. The probiotic, Lactobacillus plantarum (LBP), or placebo will be administered to 384 evaluable children and adolescents undergoing alloHCT for hematologic malignancy beginning with the initiation of conditioning through Day 56. We hypothesize that maintaining epithelial cell integrity through the administration of probiotic therapy will lead to restoring microbial diversity, which will preserve immune tolerance and prevent aGvHD. The primary study aim is to determine efficacy of orally-administered LBP in preventing the development of GI aGvHD in children and adolescents undergoing alloHCT for the treatment of cancer. Secondary study aims are: (1) To determine whether orally-administered LBP decreases the incidence of Grade II–IV aGvHD following alloHCT; (2) To determine whether LBP administration maintains intestinal integrity as measured by mean plasma citrulline levels and reduction in mucosal barrier injury (MBI) bacteremia; (3a) To measure the effects of LBP on the intestinal flora phylogenetic composition during and after alloHCT using 16S rRNA gene deep sequencing; (3b) To measure effects of LBP on intestinal flora function during and after alloHCT using metagenomic and metabolite profiling; and (4) To measure proposed immunomodulatory effects of LBP in mean plasma levels of alloreactive-induced inflammatory cytokines (IL-2, IL-6, IL-12p70, IFNγ, and TNFα) in patients receiving LBP compared to placebo. The proposed study will be the first double-blind randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of probiotics in preventing GI aGvHD in pediatric HCT. If a beneficial effect is observed, expansion of the proposed intervention to other pediatric and adult malignant conditions requiring alloHCT may improve overall quality of life and prevent transplant-related complications like aGvHD.","Project Narrative The proposed study is a randomized, controlled intervention trial to determine the benefit of probiotic therapy in preventing the development of gastrointestinal acute graft versus host disease in children undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation for a hematologic malignancy. Importantly, correlative studies will be performed to elucidate mechanisms of probiotic therapy on the microbiome. The discovery of a benefit of probiotic therapy will have a significant impact on morbidity, mortality, and cost of care in both adults and children undergoing HCT for treatment of cancer.",

In the US, close to 48 million people contract AGE and 128,000 are hospitalized each year . Episodes of AGE can result in substantial morbidity to children and their families. In addition, the costs to caregivers, the health-care system, and society are significant. At present, treatment options are limited and targeted at symptom management rather than disease modification. Probiotics - live microbial cultures which, when consumed in adequate amounts, confer documented health benefits - may be an ideal solution. They are hypothesized to work via a combination of direct microbiologic and immunologic mechanisms. Probiotics have shown promise in early clinical research in hospitalized children in developing countries. These early efforts are limited by small samples, outcomes lacking relevance to outpatients, poor methodology and absence of side effect reporting; thus, the potential role of probiotics remains poorly defined and practice guidelines do not endorse their use. There are current trends, however, that obligate an urgent assessment of these agents. First, probiotic manufacturers have embarked in aggressive public marketing strategies that make health claims that may not be supported by rigorous research, and the world-wide market for probiotic products is growing steadily (projected growth 2009-2014 12.6% for a total of US $32.6 billion/year). Second, government agencies (US FDA and European Food safety Authority (EFSA)) remain concerned about their value and safety. Third, some institutions are now recommending the use of probiotics based on potentially flawed or limited evidence. Fourth, parents of patients with AGE are often medicating their children without guidance from medical professionals. We are therefore concerned that probiotic consumption is increasing without solid evidence to support its use, which underscores the necessity to conduct a definitive trial without delay. Objectives - The overall objective of this multi-national randomized clinical trial is to determine if a specific probiotic agent, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG(LGG), the most widely available, studied and regulated probiotic in the US, should routinely be administered to outpatient children who are suffering from AGE. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) to determine the clinical effectiveness of LGG and (2) to determine the safety and side effect profile of LGG in children 3-48 months of age presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with AGE. Study Setting & Design - The study will be conducted in 8 US pediatric emergency departments within the federally funded Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN). We will randomize 900 children to receive 5 days of a probiotic agent (LGG 1 x 1010 CFU twice a day) or placebo. The main outcome is the occurrence of moderate-severe disease as defined by the Modified Vesikari Score, a validated clinical severity score, which incorporates the frequency and duration of diarrhea, frequency and duration of vomiting, height of fever, need for future health-care visits and medical interventions provided. We will also assess the occurrence of adverse events and side effects related to the use of LGG. We will collect stool samples to conduct mechanism of action studies as well as economic data to conduct cost effectiveness analyses in the future. Impact - This study will directly inform clinica practice by providing the first definitive evidence to support recommendations for or against the routine use of probiotics in the treatment of pediatric AGE. In addition it will provide health-car practitioners and policy makers with (a) a clear picture on the potential side effects from probiotic use, and with the data collected (b) knowledge on the mechanism of action and (c) of the potential economic impact of probiotic use on health-care systems and society. Thus, the potential clinical and societal impacts of the proposed study are substantial and the results will guide the standard of care: if positive, guidelines will be able to endorse probiotic administratio with important positive consequences for the health of several million US children annually. Moreover, if beneficial the cost savings to the health-care system and society may be substantial. If the results are negative, a firm recommendation against the routine use of probiotics would be justified. Collaborators - This work is collaboration between leaders in multicenter and AGE research (Schnadower, Freedman, Tarr, Gorelick, Mahajan, Stanley, Roskind, Powell, O'Connel, Ruddy Chun, Levine and Casper) in prestigious Children's Hospitals within a federally funded multicenter network (PECARN) with a strong record in conducting high quality, high impact clinical trials.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Gastroenteritis, or intestinal infection, which usually manifests as vomiting and diarrhea, is one of the most common illnesses of childhood. It causes over 1.7 million deaths per year worldwide. In the United States, it is rarely fatal, however it results in .4 million doctor visits and 128,000 hospitalizations per year and constitutes a significant burden for patients, their families and society. Currently, available treatments for this condition are aimed only at the symptoms and complications (e.g. dehydration) and not at modifying the disease process. We propose to study the effectiveness and side effects of a probiotic, LGG, in treating children with gastroenteritis. If successful, this therapeutic intervention would be the frst treatment that actually changes the disease process and would represent an enormous public health advance both in the US, and potentially, globally.",

The proline dehydrogenase gene (PRODH) is located in the common deleted region, and encodes the enzyme that catalyzes proline catabolism. Proline is a neuromodulator at glutamatergic synapses, and the peripheral hyperprolinemia arising from PRODH mutations or CNVs encompassing PRODH, has been associated with cognitive impairment and decreased IQ. We recently reported a highly significant association of hyperprolinemia with SZ. We now provide evidence that two further independent SZ risk factors: Low vitamin-D status, and mutation of the dysbindin gene (Dtnbp1), also cause hyperprolinemia. Our findings suggest convergence of the biological pathways regulated by vitamin-D and DTNBP1, via loss of PRODH expression, with elevated proline as a common SZ endophenotype. Studies have documented the dysfunctional consequences of hyperprolinemia, such as aberrant glutamatergic and dopamine signaling leading to, for example, cognitive deficits and attenuated prepulse inhibition (PPI). Targeting hyperprolinemia in the Dtnbp1 model may therefore positively impact neurotransmitter signaling and restore function. This proposed study is designed to test our hypotheses under the following Specific Aims. Aim 1: To test the relative molecular contributions of low Vitamin D, and PRODH, and DTNBP1 gene variants, to SZ- associated hyperprolinemia. In a SZ patient and control sample (n=250), we will measure plasma proline and Vitamin-D levels, confirming the strong relationship between elevated proline and low Vitamin-D. From our preliminary data, we anticipate that 80% of the measured hyperprolinemia will arise from low vitamin-D, while DTNBP1 and PRODH variants will be responsible for the remaining 20%. Thus, we will perform molecular analyses on our complete study cohort (404 subjects), screening for PRODH, and DTNBP1 variants that alter gene expression, and testing for variant associations, plus interactions with low Vitamin-D, on the outcome of proline elevation. Aim 2: To examine the molecular pathway leading to hyperprolinemia in the Dtnbp1 model. Aim 2A. Molecular analyses will include assay of peripheral and CNS tissue expression of Prodh, p53 regulated genes, and Comt (downstream of Prodh), as well as of cortical, hippocampal and peripheral proline levels. Aim 2B. Utilizing primary neurons and astrocytes from sdy-/- and Prodh+/- mice, we will directly upregulate Prodh expression, via treatment with Vitamin D and the thiazolidinedione drug Rosiglitazone (RZG), testing for restoration of Prodh expression and decreased cellular proline. Aim 3: To target hyperprolinemia in the Dtnbp1 model in vivo. We will examine whether treatment with Vitamin D (Aim 3a), RZG (Aim 3b), and, to seek to reduce the impact of off-target effects, a proline-deficient diet (Aim 3c), compared to vehicle- treatment alone, restores the above pathway in vivo, and prevents or alleviates the Sdy-/- deficit in, for example, PPI and spatial working memory.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An enzyme called 'PRODH', which is encoded by the PRODH gene, normally breaks down the amino acid proline, and we recently found that a large proportion (26%) of people with schizophrenia have 'hyperprolinemia', which is high fasting levels of proline in the blood (and there is evidence that high proline has highly toxic effects in the brain). We have now discovered that two further schizophrenia risk factors- low vitamin-D and mutation of the gene 'DTNBP1', also cause hyperprolinemia, and under this proposed study we will measure the contributions of these risk factors to the development of hyperprolinemia in schizophrenia patients and in a mouse model system that also exhibits hyperprolinemia. We will then test if treatments that turn on the PRODH gene lead to a reduction in proline and rescue the behavioral and learning deficits seen in this mouse model, which if successful would provide compelling evidence for testing whether these treatments also reduce schizophrenia symptoms in this large patient group, and thus has very important public health implications.",

TACT2, if positive, will also promote research into the mechanism(s) of benefits and provide novel insights into the pathobiology of CAD. The Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy (TACT1) was developed in response to a Request for Applications from NCCAM and the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) to address the concern that chelation use was widespread but there were no reliable data on either safety or efficacy. Surprisingly to cardiologists, the chelation strategy,  combination of up to 40 infusions with intravenous disodium EDTA plus oral multivitamins and multiminerals (OMVM) compared with intravenous and oral placebo, led to a significant reduction in the time to first recurrent cardiovascular event in patients with prior myocardial infarction (MI), age 50 or older, already treated with standard evidence based medical therapies (HR 0.74; 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.57- 0.95; p=0.016. The 5-year number needed to treat (NNT) was 12. In the prespecified subgroup with diabetes (n=633), the results were dramatic: the chelation-based strategy reduced the composite primary clinical endpoint by 51% (HR 0.49, 95%CI (0.33 0.75); p<0.001, 5-year NNT 5.5) and reduced total mortality by 43% (p=0.011, 5-year NNT 12).

A major breakthrough for prevention and cure has been the appreciation that breast cancer is not one disease, rather a collection of cancer subtypes becoming better defined by improved methodologies based upon histopathologic, genetic and molecular signatures. Over time we have applied histological type, grade, tumor size, lymph-node involvement, and estrogen receptor (ER) and HER-2/neu receptor status to help define prognosis and probability of response to therapies, yet these alone have not fully captured the varied behavior of breast cancer. The field is now rapidly progressing with gene expression and proteomic signatures that will help 'personalize' our interventions for individuals. This same concept is relevant to interventions for primary or secondary prevention and is the focus of our translational grant application. Our pre-clinical studies have demonstrated a strong benefit for dietary ω-3 fatty acid rich fish oil for the inhibition of ERPR(-)HER-2/neu(+) mammary tumors in a transgenic mouse model showing decreased tumor incidence, multiplicity and glandular atypia. Thus, our central hypothesis is that the development of aggressive breast cancer sub-types such as of ERPR(-)HER-2/neu(+) or ERPR(-)HER-2/neu(-) (i.e. triple negative) disease may be uniquely responsive to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), the long chain ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) found in fish oil. As a first step towards a future definitive prevention trial in women, we propose to test the efficacy of an ω-3 rich fish il supplement to modulate breast biomarkers indicative of anti-carcinogenic action. We will randomize high risk survivors to a placebo-low dose or high dose ω-3 rich fish oil capsule treatment and employ our breast fine needle aspiration techniques to obtain cells and tissue for analysis of biomarkers of exposure and efficacy. Our multidisciplinary team has developed the following Specific Aims to: (1) Determine the effects of dietary ω-3 fatty acids on biomarkers of exposure and response in women at high risk for recurrent estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor breast cancer +/- HER-2/neu overexpression; and (2) Define the role of dietary ω-3 PUFAs in the epigenetic regulation of the inflammatory responses underlying mammary carcinogenesis as a novel mechanism for the effects of ω-3 PUFAs. Development of these biomarkers of ω-3 PUFA exposure and response will enable the assessment of this bioactive food component in future large-scale prevention trials for women at risk for recurrence of ERPR(-)HER-2/neu(+) or triple negative breast cancer.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The genetic and molecular heterogeneity of breast cancer accounts for wide variability in clinical response and outcome and thus mandates the development of innovative targeted therapies and prevention strategies. The unresolved role of dietary fat content and specifically ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in human breast carcinogenesis, despite compelling pre-clinical studies, raises the possibility that response to dietary fat depends on critical nutrient-gene interactions that may vary between subjects and/or breast cancer subtypes. This study aims to determine the effects of dietary ω-3 fatty acids on biomarkers of exposure and response in women at high risk for recurrent estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor negative breast cancer +/- HER- 2/neu overexpression and their role in the epigenetic regulation of the inflammatory responses underlying mammary carcinogenesis.",

Inadequate intakes of vitamins D and vitamin K are common among the elderly, and both these nutrients increase risk of cognitive impairment when fed in low amounts in animal models. However, there is a fundamental gap in knowledge about the forms of vitamins D and K present in the human brain or how these individual forms are linked to AD neuropathology and biomarkers of nutrient status. In the absence of that knowledge, design of clinical trials to test therapeutic roles of vitamins D and/or K in reducing AD burden is premature. The overall goal of the proposed research is to study the associations between vitamins D and K and AD neuropathology in older persons with and without cognitive impairment from a well-characterized community-based study. Guided by strong preliminary data, this objective will be accomplished by pursuing three specific aims leveraging the Memory and Aging Project (MAP), a clinical-pathologic prospective epidemiologic cohort study: Specific Aim 1: To identify the forms and levels of vitamin D and vitamin K and their metabolites in human brain tissue collected from two neocortical regions associated with AD risk and one region unrelated to AD risk from up to 500 deceased MAP participants, and to relate these nutrient levels to markers of brain neuropathology and to cognitive decline; Specific Aim 2: To measure vitamin D and vitamin K and their metabolites in serum samples collected in a subset of 170 MAP participants over two time points to determine if these serum levels predict cognitive decline, as well as predict brain levels of vitamins D and K.; and Specific Aim 3: Determine dietary contributors, including diet patterns and individual vitamin intakes, to brain and serum vitamin D and vitamin K levels and cognitive decline in MAP participants. The proposed approach is innovative because it builds on animal models to determine whether vitamins D and K in the human brain relate to neuropathologically-defined AD. Furthermore, the proposed research will determine whether dietary intakes and serum levels of these nutrients reflect corresponding levels in the brain. A recent meta-analysis indicated that there is an immediate need for human studies, such as the one proposed here, to determine the significance of the association between biomarkers of nutrient status and AD risk. Thus the proposed research is significant because these two nutrients, which are generally consumed below recommended intakes for older persons, are modifiable, low-cost, yet safe when consumed in higher amounts. Successful completion of the proposed study will provide the first data on vitamins D and K in human brain tissue, and will provide the foundation for future studies on the impact of modifying vitamin D and/or vitamin K on AD risk.","PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health and NIA's mission for the division of neuroscience as understanding vitamin D and K's role in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias of aging offers a potentially important, novel, and low-cost intervention for populations at higher risk for dementia. A thorough analysis of this relationship will ultimately allow researchers to clarify the forms of vitamin D and vitamin K important to neuropathologically-defined dementia and justify the conduct of future vitamin D and K supplementation trials.",

VITAL-DED proposes to study the efficacy of marine omega-3 fatty acid (FA) supplementation for the prevention of DED, as well as the long-term amelioration of its associated chronic ocular surface pain and quality of life impacts, which include problems reading and driving. The study will leverage invaluable resources and data from the VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL, 1U01CA138962), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2x2 factorial trial to test marine omega-3 FA (465 mg/d eicosapentaenoic acid + 375 mg/d docosahexaenoic acid) and vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol, 2000 IU/d) supplements in the primary prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease among 20,000 men and women aged >50 y & >55 y, respectively. Beginning in July 2011 and continuing throughout 2012, willing and eligible respondents to an invitational mailing will be enrolled in a  month run-in, and subsequently those who remain willing, eligible, and compliant during the run-in will be randomly assigned to omega-3 FA or a matching placebo and vitamin D3 or a matching placebo.

We propose to ascertain prevalent (pre-randomization) and incident (post-randomization) DED endpoints in the VITAL trail. The primary Specific Aims of VITAL-DED are to test whether omega-3 FA supplementation: 1) reduces the incidence of DED, 2) improves the natural history of DED by relieving symptoms and other impacts on quality of life. Secondary Aims will estimate the incidence of DED in the US, prospectively examine the natural history of DED, explore factors that could modify or influence the impact of omega-3 FA supplementation, evaluate the inter-relationship of DED and depression, and test for possible independent or joint effects of vitamin D3 supplementation in the incidence and natural history of DED. This research is responsive to a program priority of the National Eye Institute's Strategic Plan to improve our understanding of and develop preventive strategies for inflammatory corneal and ocular surface diseases; and also addresses several issues identified in the recent 2010 NEI Workshop on Ocular Pain and Sensitivity. The hypotheses are supported by a compelling biological rationale and strong preliminary data from our prior epidemiological studies, as well as from laboratory investigations and small randomized trials, which suggest that omega-3 FA supplementation, could prevent DED and improve its natural history. We believe the timely start of VITAL-DED offers a unique but time-sensitive opportunity to obtain a reliable, efficient, and informative evaluation of the efficacy of the most promising preventive agent for DED. Given our success with prior large simple trials, our experience with DED, and our proposed methodology, we think VITAL-DED will provide definitive results to guide public health and clinical recommendations for DED prevention and management.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to accelerate the identification and availability of a safe and effective strategy to prevent dry eye disease (DED) and improve its natural history. This is important because DED is very common among older Americans, causing chronic ocular pain, an increased risk of infection, and problems with activities such as reading and driving. Existing evidence points to omega-3 fatty acids as the most promising agent to test for DED prevention and therapy, and we will take advantage of the incomparable opportunity offered by the VITAL trial (VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL), a large randomized trial of 20,000 older men and women to evaluate whether a supplement of omega-3 fatty acids versus a placebo can prevent DED and improve people's quality of life.",

The mechanisms driving increased CHD risk in HIV+ people are unclear, but are linked to inflammation. HIV, heavy drinking, and smoking are all pro-inflammatory. HIV viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy does not eliminate the elevated CHD risk nor the increased inflammation (i.e., pre-HIV infection levels are not restored). Interventions that reduce alcohol use, smoking, or both in HIV+ people could lower inflammation, CHD and death risk. Varenicline and cytisine are proven therapies for smoking cessation. When compared to placebo, varenicline has higher cessation rates than cytisine. Human trials suggest varenicline also has efficacy for reducing alcohol consumption and craving in heavy drinking smokers. In murine models, cytisine reduces alcohol consumption. The comparative efficacy of varenicline and cytisine to reduce alcohol consumption and by extension, inflammation, CHD, and mortality risk, in humans has not been tested, nor has their comparative effectiveness been tested for smoking. Neither drug has been tested for smoking cessation against nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) in HIV+ heavy drinking smokers. Three compelling reasons to test varenicline and cytisine in HIV+ heavy drinking smokers are: 1) both show promise in HIV-uninfected people; 2) the morbidity caused by heavy drinking and smoking in HIV+ persons is significant; and 3) treating heavy drinking and smoking with one medication represents a significant advance in reducing polypharmacy and improving patient care. Thus, we propose a 4-arm placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial (RCT) among 400 HIV+ heavy drinking smokers. Trial arms are varenicline+NRT placebo, cytisine+NRT placebo, NRT+varenicline placebo, NRT+cytisine placebo. All participants will receive counseling (alcohol & tobacco) and medications (placebo & active). Our specific aims will compare effects of varenicline, cytisine, and NRT at 3 months on past month % heavy drinking days and alcohol craving, cigarettes per day and smoking abstinence (verified by carbon monoxide), inflammation (hsCRP, IL-6), CHD (Reynolds risk score), and mortality (VACS index) risk. We hypothesize that (1) Varenicline has greater efficacy than NRT for reducing heavy drinking, smoking, inflammation, CHD and mortality risk; (2) Cytisine has greater efficacy than NRT; and (3) Varenicline has greater efficacy than cytisine for these outcomes. We will conduct an RCT, Studying Partial-agonists for Ethanol and Tobacco Elimination in Russians with HIV (St PETER HIV), in a country with an HIV epidemic and high per-capita alcohol consumption and smoking. We will recruit from our ongoing Russia ARCH cohort in St. Petersburg (part of our NIAAA funded HIV/AIDS Alcohol Consortium – URBAN ARCH). If our hypotheses are correct, St PETER HIV could make nicotinic partial-agonists standard care for HIV+ heavy drinking smokers, and lead to reduced inflammation, CHD and mortality risk through this “one drug, two diseases” approach. This trial addresses the paucity of RCT data to guide treatment of these CHD risk factors in HIV+ people.","The Russia ARCH Cohort and the St PETER HIV study will draw from an established cohort of HIV-infected smokers and heavy drinkers to compare the effects of two partial nicotinic receptors, varenicline and cytisine, on alcohol consumption, alcohol craving, smoking, inflammation, CHD risk and mortality risk.

Health effects associated with WSP include acute bronchitis, asthma exacerbation, pneumonia, cough and systemic inflammation in in healthy persons and those with asthma. Cardiovascular effects have also been reported with WSP exposure. WSP from wildland fires can cause abrupt increases in ambient air PM 2.5 levels, and avoidance of rapidly increasing PM air pollution is not feasible as many residents cannot leave the burn region, and wildland firefighters move into wildland fire sites, often for several consecutive days. As avoidance of PM is not feasible in these settings, there is a clear unmet need for interventions to reduce adverse health effects caused by acute WSP exposure. Our team has developed gamma tocopherol (gT), an isoform of vitamin E with robust anti-inflammatory actions, as a chemopreventive intervention for inflammation caused by environmental contaminants. Our animal studies show that gT inhibits allergen, ozone and endotoxin-induced airway inflammation. Our human phase I studies show that gT decreases inflammatory response of circulating monocytes, decreases nitrosative stress, and inhibits neutrophil (PMN) influx to the airway in vivo after endotoxin challenge. Thus, gT supplementation is an attractive nutritional/nutraceutical approach to decreasing the adverse health effects of inhaled WSP. We have also developed a 500µg/m3 WSP exposure protocol which induces both airway and systemic increases in PMNs in human volunteers. Using this challenge protocol, we will undertake a randomized, placebo-controlled study to determine if of supplementation with 1200 mg of on WSP-induced airway and systemic PMN increases in healthy and asthmatic volunteers. Exploratory endpoints will include non-specific bronchial reactivity (NSBR), and cardiovascular responses reported to be impacted by PM exposure. These studies will also allow us to compare responses of allergic asthmatic (AA) and healthy volunteers (HV) to determine if atopy or other facets of asthma modify risk for inflammatory response to WSP. This study will be the first to test a specific nutritional supplement as a chemopreventive intervention for WSP-induced inflammation in either AAs or NVs, and to specifically compare the response of these groups to WSP-induced inflammation.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we will examine the ability of supplementation with gamma tocopherol (gT), a form of naturally occurring vitamin E, to prevent lung and systemic inflammation following exposure to wood smoke particles (WSP) in healthy and asthmatic volunteers. WSPs from wildfires are a major contributor to air pollution. Many people cannot escape areas where there is increased fire related WSP air pollution, so safe and inexpensive treatments (such as gT) are urgently needed to prevent environmentally-induced lung disease.",

In this application, we propose to examine the role of the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin, and its primary regulator vitamin D, in lung function impairment, respiratory infections and acute exacerbations of COPD as well as evaluate the effect of oral vitamin D supplementation on lung cathelicidin levels in humans. Cathelicidin has bactericidal and inflammatory activities in the lung and is regulated by vitamin D levels. Our hypothesis is that reduced cathelicidin levels are associated with accelerated lung function decline though a pathway partially mediated by increased infections and COPD exacerbations. We hypothesize the effect of cathelicidin on lung function is greater in those with vitamin D insufficiency and that oral vitamin D supplementation will raise cathelicidin levels in the pulmonary compartment, thereby restoring lung cathelicidin deficiency. Specifically, through longitudinal investigation nested within an ongoing cohort study of urban, predominantly African-American individuals at high risk for development of OLDs, we will characterize the rate of lung function decline in 380 participants followed with serial spirometry measures for up to six years. Baseline and repeated measures of cathelicidin and vitamin D will be examined as independent predictors of lung function decline and respiratory infections. Separately, using longitudinal data from 2100 participants enrolled in the Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study (SPIROMICS) study with established COPD, baseline measures of blood cathelicidin and vitamin D will be examined as an independent predictor of longitudinal FEV1 decline and COPD exacerbations over three years. In both cohorts, concurrent vitamin D measurements will permit evaluation of antecedent and modifier on the cathelicidin-lung outcomes relationships. Finally, we will measure blood and lung lavage cathelicidin levels in 40 vitamin D insufficient individuals before and after eight weeks of oral vitamin D supplementation to determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on cathelicidin levels. Completion of these aims will provide a robust determination of the role of cathelicidin in lung function decline and adverse pulmonary outcomes in unique populations of at-risk and diseased individuals. Moreover, the aims of this application directly or indirectly wor towards ultimately understanding if a readily measurable blood marker, cathelicidin, can inform who may benefit from vitamin D supplementation to prevent chronic lung disease. The results from this application would lead to a therapeutic intervention study that will provide further opportunities to improve our understanding of the relationship between vitamin D, cathelicidin and lung function.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal will evaluate a potential mechanism of increased risk of lung function impairment, as well as determine if vitamin D replacement can alter this pathway.

Specifically, to the large (N=25,875) and simple parent VITAL trial, we added kidney outcomes and accompanying clinical data to a subset of 1,322 VITAL participants with prevalent type 2 diabetes to test the effects of vitamin D3 and omega-3 fatty acids on the clinical manifestations of DKD. In this competitive renewal application, we propose to extend follow-up of our VITAL DKD ancillary study from 2 to 5 years, add measurements to stored specimens to more comprehensively evaluate treatment effects, and assess intermediate cardiovascular outcomes that complement our primary renal outcome. Our approach builds on our recruited study population and completed measurements and leverages the infrastructure of the parent VITAL trial, which is funded by the NIH to provide study treatments and basic data acquisition through 2017. We have recruited a diverse study population with type 2 diabetes that has or is at risk of DKD and is maintaining excellent adherence to study medications. To extend our study, our experienced study team will apply methods developed and successfully implemented during our initial funding period.

Most cases are sporadic, but Mendelian pedigrees have been described, typically with low penetrance. Few genes have been identified, encoding transcription and growth factors (e.g. SOX2, BMP4) active during early eye development. Most cases are unexplained. Maternal nutrition may contribute to the etiology. We found mutations in three retinoid (vitamin A) pathway genes (RBP4, STRA6, ALDH1A3) account for >5% of MAC cases, including a new gain-of-function mechanism for this disease. The RBP4 alleles encode dominant-negative serum retinol binding proteins, which bind retinol cargo poorly but adhere to the STRA6 cell surface receptor too tightly (40-fold higher affinity) – so may disrupt retinol transfer across the yolk sac and placenta, to the embryo. The dnRBP4 mutations define a new mode of maternal inheritance and illuminate a critical protein- receptor interaction. In addition, clustered hypomorphic STRA6 alleles suggest a new domain function for this polytopic receptor. We will investigate the mechanism for increased RBP affinity and critical features of the RBP-STRA6 interaction, and test the receptor competition model for MAC pathogenesis [1] in vitro and [2] in vivo, using a comprehensive biochemical, cell-based, radioisotopic and histological approach, mouse models with specific knock-out or genome-edited (CRISPR/Cas9) alleles, and dietary manipulation. In addition, [3] we will systematically screen a cohort of MAC patients using whole exome sequencing (WES) and segmental dosage (SNP) analysis to find causative mutations in new genes.","NARRATIVE We will investigate gene defects in children whose eyes are absent (anophthalmia), very small or malformed (coloboma), using biochemical methods, mouse models and genome sequencing. Our study is centered on new mutations that appear to block retinol (vitamin A) transport and metabolism, or the separation of neural and pigmented layers in the developing retina. We will test new models for hereditary disease, establish a nutritional basis for maternal inheritance of disease traits in pedigrees, and explore the earliest steps in eye formation. The results should improve diagnosis and understanding of eye malformations, and complex genetic factors underlying birth defects.",

While existing techniques such as cryoablation or surgical excision are generally curative, those treatments cause scarring that can be especially disfiguring in patients at high risk for skin cancer (i.e., patients with chronic severe photodamage; immunosuppression due to organ transplantation; or Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome, BCNS). Photodynamic therapy (PDT) combines a photosensitizer (protoporphyrin PpIX, induced by the administration of aminolevulic acid, ALA) with activation by visible light, and is a completely nonscarring technique. PDT is approved by the FDA for field treatment of widespread cutaneous precancers, and in European countries PDT is also approved for treating SCC and BCC. In the U.S. however, approval of PDT for SCC and BCC will require further clinical trials to demonstrate an efficacy similar to existing techniques (destructive ablation). As a new way to increase PDT efficacy, we showed that in animal models of SCC and BCC, transient administration of Vitamin D (VD) prior to ALA-PDT enhances PpIX accumulation and PDT efficacy. The oral (dietary) form of VD (cholecalciferol; D3, given as 10,000 IU/day for 10 days) increases PDT-induced tumor killing by several fold, and is very safe with little risk for inducing hypercalcemia. In this grant, we propose to test this approach in human clinical trials using oral D3 as a neoadjuvant to PDT. Aim 1 will examine the relationship between VD status (serium 25OH-D3) and PDT efficacy for CIS. Subaim 1a is a longitudinal study to test the correlation between serum 25OH-D3 levels and treatment outcomes in routine PDT patients in our clinics, and to examine the predictive value of certain biomarkers (e.g. VDR allelic polymorphisms). Subaim 1b is an interventional trial to assess the benefit of giving neoadjuvant D3 (transient oral D3) prior to PDT. Results from combined D3/PDT treatment (Subaim 1b) will be compared to results after D3 alone (Subaim 1a), stratified by the VD deficiency status. In Aim 2, we will examine the potential benefit of neoadjuvant D3/PDT in patients with BCNS (Gorlin-Goltz syndrome). These patients, who have multiple BCC tumors will receive 3 bimonthly PDT treatments, and rates of tumor shrinkage will be correlated with serum 25OH-D3 levels. Each patient will serve as his/her own control by randomizing the order of the first two PDT treatments, one session to be done with neoadjuvant D3 and the other without. The third PDT treatment will occur after the serum VD level has been adjusted to normal levels with D3 supplements. This approach will allow us to determine whether neoadjuvant D3/PDT can help all patients, even the VD deficient individuals, through customization of D3 dose. Together, we expect this group of clinical trials to establish the foundation for a new treatment modality, i.e., neoadjuvant D3/PDT for skin cancer. The potential benefit for public health is that data showing improved efficacy of PDT with this safe and simple approach will lay the foundation for a nonscarring alternative to surgery for early SCC and BCC tumors.","PROJECT NARRATIVE This is a proposal to develop a new combination regimen that combines Vitamin D3 pretreatment with photodynamic therapy (PDT), as a nonsurgical and non-scarring alternative for the treatment of skin cancer. In clinical trials, we will test the hypothesis that oral Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) will boost the levels of target photosensitizer (protoporphyrin IX) in widespread squamous cell precancers and in basal cell carcinoma, and improve the therapeutic response to PDT. Our study population will comprise patients at high risk, including organ transplant recipients and patients with the Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome. The potential benefit to public health is a safe, efficacious, and non-scarring alternative to surgery for the treatment of skin cancer.",

Even though it is well known that insulin resistance and chronic inflammation lead to HTN and accelerate vascular disease in patients with T2DM, very little is known about the mechanisms by which these risk factors promote HTN and CVD. Vitamin D deficiency in patients with T2DM is almost twice that of non-diabetics, and most of the randomized clinical trials evaluating vitamin D supplementation in uncomplicated T2DM have demonstrated BP reductions, suggesting a possible effect in this population. Thus, the goal of this application is to identify the molecular mechanisms by which vitamin D deficiency promotes HTN in the setting of T2DM. Our preliminary data indicates that mice with macrophage- specific deletion of the VDR (KODMAC) were hypertensive with increased systemic renin, activation of the macrophage renin angiotensin system (RAS) in the aorta, and renal macrophage infiltration into the juxtaglomerular (JG) apparatus, the main source of renin production. Peritoneal macrophages from KODMAC or their media activated JG cell renin production via macrophage secretion of miR106b. This effect was blunted by lack of macrophage ER stress-regulated (C/EBP) homologous protein (CHOP). Similar effects were found with macrophages from vitamin D-deficient mice or from vitamin D-deficient patients with T2DM. Thus, we hypothesize that vitamin D-deficient macrophages increase systemic renin and hypertension in T2DM via increased secretion of miR-106b, stimulating renin secretion by JG cells, and/or via macrophage RAS-dependent mechanism. To test this hypothesis, Aim 1 will determine whether bone marrow (BM) transplant from miR-106b-/- or CHOP-/- into vitamin D-deficient mice improves HTN and decreases systemic renin. In Aim 2, we will evaluate whether BM transplant from Renin 1c-/- into vitamin D-deficient mice improves HTN and decreases systemic renin. In Aim 3, we will also assess the role of these inflammatory mechanisms of HTN in patients with T2DM and vitamin D deficiency by correlating changes in plasma miR-106b levels with changes in blood pressure after vitamin D supplementation (Aim 3a) and by testing whether monocytes or serum from vitamin D-deficient diabetics with HTN induce JG cell renin secretion via miR-106b (Aim 3b). This proposal will identify the mechanisms by which vitamin D deficiency regulates the innate immune system to induce systemic renin production and HTN in type 2 diabetes and thus, provide new therapeutic targets for these pervasive diseases.  ","PROJECT NARRATIVE  It is well-recognized that chronic inflammation integrates insulin resistance with hypertension and cardiovascular complications, but the mechanisms are undefined. We found that cell-specific deletion of the macrophage vitamin D receptor in mice is sufficient to cause renin-dependent hypertension, which corrects with bone marrow (BM) transplantation of cells with intact VDR. This study will determine whether macrophage RAS activation and/or miR106b secretion are critical mechanism by which vitamin D-deficiency increased systemic renin and induce hypertension in a mouse model of insulin resistance and in patients with type 2 diabetes.  ",

There are several mechanisms by which low vitamin D status may promote AD pathology, including reduced β-amyloid (Aβ) clearance, dysregulation of calcium influx and glutamate- mediated neurotoxicity. Vitamin D interacts with receptors in the hippocampus and many other brain regions, and has established antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Recent neuroimaging studies have found that low vitamin D levels are associated with increased periventricular white matter disease, reduced white matter volume and larger ventricles. Vitamin D deficiency may also have a toxic effect on brain function independent of Aβ metabolism. Preliminary studies of serum vitamin D levels in a diverse multi-ethnic cohort (n=382) of the UC Davis Alzheimer's Disease Center found a high prevalence of low vitamin D status (61% with levels <20 ng/ml), which was associated with faster rates of decline on executive function and episodic memory. This Phase II randomized clinical trial aims to test if supplementation with high dose oral vitamin D will successfully correct vitamin D insufficiency, compared to treatment with standard (RDA) dose vitamin D in a diverse community-based elderly cohort. The effect of high-dose vs. standard-dose vitamin D on altering cognitive trajectories will also be assessed and data will be expected to be used in designing a potential definitive Phase III trial in elderly groups at risk for dementia. A total of 180 elderly persons with longitudinal biomarkers, neuropsychological testing and brain MRI scans will be enrolled, with 152 (~50 with MCI, 50 with mild AD and 50 with no cognitive impairment) expected to complete the 3½-year study. One-half of each diagnostic group will be randomized to treatment with high-dose vitamin D3 (4,000 IU daily) or to standard dose Vitamin D (600 IU capsule daily + ~200 IU dietary = ~800 IU total/day). Longitudinal MRI analyses will provide an estimate of the treatment effect size on brain atrophy rate. Vitamin D receptor genotype polymorphisms and their impact on response to oral supplementation will also be examined. If vitamin D supplementation improves cognitive outcome, this could have a large impact on the public health, since low vitamin D status is a common, readably treatable condition which may provide a novel window to prevent dementia and AD. Furthermore, the higher prevalence of AD and dementia in African Americans and Latinos could be partially attributable to vitamin D insufficiency.","PROJECT NARRATIVE Low vitamin D status is associated with increased risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD), the higher prevalence of these conditions in African Americans and Latinos could be partially attributable to vitamin D insufficiency.

The results of the study and its corollary biomarker analyses will be used to guide development of a randomized Phase II placebo-controlled clinical trial to test the efficacy of LGG as a GI protective agent in this same population which is our long-term goal. In the US, cancer originating from the GI tract (rectum, pancreas, stomach and anal canal) is a significant clinical problem with over 110,000 new diagnoses each year. Successful completion of cytotoxic radiation therapy (RT) significantly improves outcomes and cure rates for patients with locally advanced gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies. Despite use of highly focused (RT), patients undergoing pelvic or abdominal RT are at high risk of diarrheal complications from collateral damage to small intestine. Combining RT with chemotherapy adds to the GI toxicity with symptoms that include diarrhea resulting in dehydration and hospitalization. These GI toxicities are a dose-limiting side-effect for cytotoxic therapy which is a significant clinical problem as it leads to reduced efficacy of the cancer treatment regimen. There is currently an unmet need for agents that could protect the normal small intestinal epithelium from collateral damage whereby reducing symptoms of GI toxicity so that patients can receive optimal cancer therapy and a maximized quality of life. New evidence suggests that certain probiotic bacteria may be an innovative approach to reduce cytotoxic therapy-associated GI toxicity. Probiotic bacteria have been used safely as therapy in several GI conditions and offer the advantage of luminal delivery of a locally acting agent. These properties make probiotics a potentially ideal therapy to prevent collateral damage to the normal GI tract during cancer therapy. Using an established experimental model, we found that prophylactic administration of the probiotic LGG effectively reduced cell death and promoted epithelial recovery at doses relevant to humans. Our new preclinical data also indicate that this approach works in fractionated radiation dosing regimens similar to what humans receive during cancer therapy, but importantly does not impact tumor radiosensitivity. This data and detailed analysis of prior clinical trials from outside the US have informed the development of our central hypothesis that 'Oral supplementation with the probiotic LGG will reduce treatment-related GI toxicity by protecting the intestinal epithelium in patients receiving cytotoxic therapy for gastrointestinal cancer.' Under FDA and IRB approved protocols we will address our central hypothesis to determine the safety and tolerability for LGG as an intestinal protectant in patients receiving RT for GI malignancy in a Phase I study. As a biovalidation aim, we will also establish how novel biomarkers correlate with clinical symptom indices of treatment related GI toxicity. If successful, the significance of this Phase I trial wil enable and guide the initiation of a multi-center, randomized Phase II study to evaluate LGG's efficacy as an intestinal cytoprotectant during therapy for GI malignancy.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall goals of this application are to determine the safety and tolerability of the probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) when given to patients receiving chemoradiation for pelvic malignancies. Our studies have significant public health relevance in that injury to the normal small intestine is a major source of morbidity in patients receiving radiation therapy for pelvic malignancies. The development of LGG as a radioprotective agent would allow for decreased morbidity, particularly decreased diarrhea, in patients receiving radiation therapy for pelvic malignancies.",

Despite food fortification and dietary supplementation, vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency is still relativly common in the US. Many epidemiologic studies consistently found that low vitamin D status was associated with increased risks of non-skeletal chronic diseases including colorectal cancer (CRC). However, randomized clinical trials generated inconsistent results. One striking observation is that a large portion of the inter-person variation in serum 25- hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels is unexplained. Further, there is a substantial inter-individual variation in serum 25(OH)D in response to the same dose of vitamin D supplementation. Mg plays a critical role in the synthesis and metabolism of vitamin D. The activities of 3 key enzymes determining 25(OH)D level may be Mg-dependent. Further, Mg deficiency has been implicated in 'Mg-dependent vitamin-D-resistant rickets' and Mg supplementation substantially reversed resistance to vitamin D treatment. Very recently, we found intake of Mg significantly interacted with intake of vitamin D in relation to risks of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency. Furthermore, we found the associations of serum 25(OH)D with mortality, including mortality due to CRC, may be modified by Mg intake, and the reduction in risk associated with high serum concentrations of 25(OH)D appeared primarily among those with Mg intake e median. Our novel finding of Mg-vitamin D interaction may explain some of the variability in 25(OH)D levels and may provide another possible interpretation to explain previous inconsistencies. Very recently, an animal study found the Mg-deficient diet significantly reduced the mRNA of the enzyme that primarily converts 25(OH)D to its active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)D), and significantly increased mRNA expression of the enzyme which mainly converts 25(OH)D to 24,25- dihydroxyvitamin D (24,25(OH)D). Further, a randomized clinical trial of vitamin D supplementation observed changes in vitamin D metabolite conversion with a significant increase in conversion of 25(OH)D to 24,25(OH)D. However, the ratio of serum 24,25(OH)D to serum 25(OH)D was only temporarily and slightly affected by vitamin D supplementation. Furthermore, the initial ratio predicted the efficacy of vitamin D treatment (i.e. rise in 25(OH)D). Based on these findings, we hypothesize that Mg supplementation reduces 24,25(OH)D and the ratio of 24,25(OH)D/ 25(OH)D (two markers of Mg deficiency), and, thus, improves resistance to vitamin D and reduces risk of CRC. To test hypothesis, we propose to measure serum levels of 24,25(OH)D, 25(OH)D, and 1,25 (OH)D in samples collected prior to and at the conclusion of a 12-week Mg intervention in 180 individuals (90 Mg-treatment and 90 placebo). This study will be the first to evaluate the effect of Mg supplementation on resistance to vitamin D and will lay the foundation for future prevention trials.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will investigate the effect of magnesium treatment on change in vitamin D metabolite levels and ratio. This study is very critical to understand whether vitamin D metabolism and vitamin D resistance (i.e. insensitivity to vitamin D supplementation) can be improved by magnesium supplementation and to translate it into a preventive strategy for colorectal cancer and, possibly, other cancers. Thus, the proposed study has profound public health and clinical implications.",

The parent project for this K01 award is a Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation-sponsored randomized control trial called Women First (clinicaltrials.gov NCT01883193). Women first is a large mother-infant longitudinal birth cohort in the 3rd world (4 international sites) that is investigating whether timing of nutritional intervention can improve maternal and infant outcomes. This K01 award will examine one international site (Guatemala) that is prone to both growth stunting and obesity. My proposed research project will assess changes in DNA methylation in umbilical cord blood (UCB) from infants born to lean or obese mothers who consumed micronutrient supplementation (MNS) for ≥ 3 months prior to conception (Arm 1), MNS commenced at 12 wk gestation (Arm 2), or no supplementation (Arm 3) and offspring susceptibility for stunted growth (birth length) and obesity (weight-for-length Z-score). My primary hypothesis is that maternal nutritional and metabolic status, prior to conception, will result in differentially methylation regions (DMRs) in umbilical cord blood (UCB) associated with linear growth and susceptibility to obesity. Specifically, I propose 3 novel approaches to examine the effects of pre-conception MNS and pre-pregnancy BMI on the infant epigenome: SA1) Identification of differentially methylated regions using Roche - NimbleGen SeqCap Epi SA2) Assessing DNA methylation of newly identified obesity-associated metastable epialleles SA3) Use 2-step Mendelian Randomization to strengthen causal inference of my postulated pathway: Maternal MNS & pre-pregnancy BMI → ∆ DNA methylation → infant outcome (birth length & body weight)  Due to limited experience assessing epigenetics in large clinical cohorts, I have devised a specific training plan to acquire epigenetic, clinical, and analytical skills. I hve identified mentors at Anschutz Medical Campus who are highly productive leaders in developmental programming and obesity (Dr. Jed Friedman), international nutrition and pediatrics (Dr. Nancy Krebs), epigenetics (Dr. Ivana Yang), bioinformatics (Dr. Kenneth Jones), and epidemiology (Dr. Dana Dabalea). My training plan will also take advantage of 2 key international experts i) Dr. Caroline Relton, who has pioneered 2-step Mendelian randomization, and ii) Dr. John Greally, who has helped innovate the SeqCap Epi methodology with Roche-NimbleGen as well as numerous other epigenetic-related accolades. My training plan encompasses cutting edge epigenetic analysis tools, an outstanding network of advisors, and an innovative tool-kit to facilitate a successful transition to an independent career in translatioal epigenetics and the developmental origins of obesity.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    This project will provide a deeper understanding about how the timing of maternal nutritional interventions may impact infant and child development, and risk for growth and metabolic complications such as obesity and insulin resistance. These studies not only include the first '1000 days of life', but also incorporate the time period leading up to conception (≥ 3 months prior to conception). Growing evidence suggests that maternal nutritional status before pregnancy may be more important for infant health. Importantly, discovering informative biomarkers, at birth,that may be predictive for later risk of impaired growth and non-communicable disease risk may lead to better recommendations to improve maternal and child health",

Inflammation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and protein-energy wasting. Biomarkers of the inflammatory state such as       C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are elevated in MHD patients and are also robust predictors of cardiovascular events and mortality in this patient population. While anti-inflammatory interventions, especially specific anti-cytokin therapies have been used successfully to treat patients with inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, and while encouraging studies have been reported in improving glycemic control and beta cell function in type 2 diabetes, there are only limited studies using these interventions in MHD patients. Our investigative group has performed a series of studies investigating the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of a number of anti-inflammatory therapies in MHD patients, including Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), Fish Oil (EPA+DHA), Vitamin E (gamma-tocopherol), alpha lipoic acid (ALA) and CoEnyzme Q10 in studies ranging from 14 patients to 300 patients. We have shown that amongst these interventions, IL-1ra and Fish Oil therapies have the most significant beneficial effects on inflammatory markers, such as hsCRP and    IL- 6; whereas Vitamin E and ALA therapies do not influence inflammatory state in these patients. This grant application is submitted in response to the recent NIDDK RFA DK-12-010 (Novel Interventions to Reduce Morbidity and Mortality of Hemodialysis Patients - Safety and Other Early Phase Studies) and has the overarching aim of studying the safety, feasibility and efficacy of promising pharmacological and dialytic interventions in maintenance hemodialysis patients through a U01 collaboration mechanism. Our specific aims are 1) To test the efficacy of IL-1ra and Fish Oil on inflammatory biomarkers over 6 months through two separate randomized clinical trials in maintenance hemodialysis patients; 2) To test the safety and tolerability of IL-1ra and Fish Oil over 6 months through two separate randomized clinical trials in maintenance hemodialysis patients; 3) Create a collaborative network of investigators and dialysis facilities for efficient and swift subject recruitment for pilot and feasibility studies in maintenance hemodialysis patients.

The focus of the Program is directed toward synthetic retinoids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and phytochemicals. However, the scope of the program and depth of expertise have been expanded by strategic recruitment and a mentoring program. Furthermore, transdisciplinary research is nurtured through focused working groups. This program is co- directed by Dr. Craig A. Elmets (Professor and Chair, Department of Dermatology and Director of the UAB Skin Diseases Research Center) and Dr. Clinton J. Grubbs (Professor, Department of Surgery and Director of the Chemoprevention Center). Currently, the program is comprised of 18 members from 10 departments and 5 schools. This program has $4,187,741 in annual direct cost funding, of which 76% is derived from the NCI. In addition to the traditional utilization of inter-programmatic teams and intra-programmatic collaborations, the capabilities of the program are greatly expanded by established extramural agreements: (1) Dr. Grubbs directs Task Order from the NCI PREVENT program which awards contracts to investigators both at UAB and other institutions, and (2) Dr. Elmets participates in an NCI-funded consortium of early phase human chemoprevention trials led by the University of Wisconsin. Over the past four years, the program has produced 206 publications, of which 35% % were intra-programmatic, 28%% were inter-programmatic, and 34% were inter-institutional. A vibrant communications component that includes a seminar series with lecturers from inside and outside the University supports collaborative research among program investigators. Major completed studies at UAB have moved chemopreventive agents from various classes (including rexinoids, cyclooxygenase inhibitors, and dietary polyphenols) to clinical trials during the last few years.","No data",

As life expectancy increases, co-morbidities such as CF-related diabetes (CFRD) become more prevalent. It is thus increasingly important to identify pathophysiologic pathways that will inform nutritional therapies for adult patients with CF. Recent advances in metabolomics analysis provide a novel opportunity to broadly explore metabolism and underlying pathways relevant to disease exacerbation and recovery in CF. The PI, Jessica A. Alvarez, PhD, RD, will use high-resolution, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomics methods as a tool to interrogate the plasma metabolome in cohorts of adult CF patients, with or without CFRD, in collaboration with a multidisciplinary team of expert mentors (including Lead Mentor Dr. Thomas R. Ziegler and Co-Mentors Drs. Dean P. Jones, Vin Tangpricha, Arlene A. Stecenko, and Nael A. McCarty). Based on preliminary clinical and metabolomics research findings by the PI and the mentoring team, the working hypotheses of this project are: 1) aminothiol redox imbalance in CF contributes to impaired fatty acid �-oxidation, and 2) vitamin D supplementation normalizes the redox system and, subsequently, �-oxidation. Specific Aim 1 is to confirm a defect in �- oxidation in adult CF subjects using high-resolution targeted plasma metabolomics analysis and complementary in vivo bioenergetic assessment methods (indirect calorimetry,31phosphorus-magnetic resonance spectroscopy) in a cross-sectional study of adult subjects with CF compared to healthy, age matched controls. Specific Aim 2 will determine if plasma aminothiol redox status is associated with �-oxidation in this cross-sectional study. Specific Aim 3 is a pilot study to determine the impact of high-dose oral vitamin D3 on indexes of �-oxidation and aminothiol redox in adult CF patients hospitalized for pulmonary exacerbation and followed during clinical recovery in an ongoing, double-blind, randomized controlled trial. Emory University boasts an intellectually rich research environment whose resources will be used to carry out the proposed research, including an NIH-funded Atlanta Clinical and Translational Science Institute Clinical Research Network site. The primary goal of this K01 career development proposal is for Dr. Alvarez to develop expertise in high-resolution metabolomics for use in clinically oriented nutrition research, which will highly complement her nutrition and metabolism training to-date. The proposed research, in combination with a structured mentoring and training plan that includes didactic courses and workshops, is designed to facilitate Dr. Alvarez's long-term goal of developing an independently-funded clinical and translational nutrition research program in chronic catabolic diseases, such as CF, consistent with the mission of the NIDDK.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With better medical care, patients with cystic fibrosis, a life-threatening disease, are enjoying longer lives.

This project will address underlying mechanisms to account for immune dysregulation, including early molecular markers of autoimmunity, associated with proximity to AUM and uranium and mixed metal exposure. Biomonitoring results confirm that community members are exposed to uranium and other metals beyond national norms. Our published and preliminary work shows that certain metals interact with key cellular targets to disrupt zinc-dependent protein function. We will test the hypothesis that metals disrupt multiple classes of zinc binding proteins known to regulate immune responses, and that supplemental zinc will mitigate immunotoxicity resulting from metal exposures. In Aim 1 aim we will investigate whether serum zinc sufficiency modifies immune dysregulation in individuals exposed to environmental metals by performing a cross-sectional analysis of archived population samples for associations between markers of immune function with metal and zinc levels present in blood and urine samples. Aim 2 will test the immunotoxic effects and underlying mechanisms of U, As and environmentally relevant metal mixtures defined by the Environmental Projects, and whether the immunotoxic effects are reduced by supplemental zinc in cell and mouse models. Aim 3 will test whether dietary zinc supplementation will decrease biomarkers of immune dysregulation in exposed populations in partnership with exposed communities. The work is innovative by combining exposure information and biomonitoring data from exposed populations with mechanistic studies in experimental models. To date, there are no significant, community-based health studies describing both exposure and immunologic outcome measures in these impacted Tribal communities. We propose a novel hypothesis that metals exposures disrupt multiple classes of Zn binding proteins critical for immune function leading to immune dysregulation and that supplemental Zn will mitigate metal toxicity. This study represents the first human intervention based on zinc supplementation to ameliorate the adverse effects of mixed metal exposures. To achieve the research goals, BP1 is well integrated with the Environmental Projects to inform distinct metals exposures, BP2 to share mechanistic data and model systems, the Community Engagement and Research Translation Cores for community input and reporting results back to the communities, and the Biostatistics and Data Management Core for research support. The outcomes from these studies will be significant by testing metals and metals mixtures of concern to communities to elucidate impact on and mechanisms of immune dysregulation as detected in exposed populations, and test the feasibility of a mechanism-based intervention to alleviate the adverse effects of metals exposures.","Project 3 – BioProject 1 (BP1) - Project Narrative This project addresses health effects associated with exposure to uranium and other metals found in legacy uranium mining waste sites in three Native American communities.

Most asthma is diagnosed before the age of six. Thus, prenatal and early life exposures play an important role in the development of asthma and allergies. On the basis of finding an inverse association between family size and atopy, it was postulated that reduced microbial exposure in early life explains the epidemic of allergic diseases (the “hygiene hypothesis”). The original hygiene hypothesis has undergone changes and refinement, and is now taken to mean not just simply a reduced microbial exposure, but perhaps changes in the breadth and types of microorganisms coupled with changing environments. The gut flora is, quantitatively, the most important postnatal source of microbial stimulation of the immune system. Significant differences between the gut flora of children in industrialized and developing nations suggest that the high prevalence of asthma in affluent nations may be due to changes in the intestinal flora of young infants. This concept of “dysbiotic drift,” whereby environmental forces related to Westernized lifestyles leads to a shift of the developing microbiota away from the norm, may explain why many chronic inflammatory conditions, such as asthma, are associated with Westernized lifestyles. Dysbiosis is a potential mechanism by which the environment interacts with the early developing immune system to program risk for chronic disease. While there are a growing number of studies that are investigating the role of the intestinal microbiome in asthma, these have examined stool samples obtained at one point in time. Since the intestinal microbiome undergoes rapid changes before it becomes established between the ages of 1 and 3 years of life, longitudinal studies are needed. Additionally, no studies have accounted for the host genetic background, which may determine both the development of dysbiosis and who develops asthma when faced with dysbiosis. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that vitamin D deficiency in the pre-, peri-, and immediate post-natal periods, in addition to host genetic influences, lead to intestinal dysbiosis in early life. Dysbiosis, in the proper host genetic context, then increases the risk for development of asthma. While we have collected information on a host of other relevant exposures, this proposal will focus on vitamin D as the primary exposure of interest. We have put together 2 vitamin D clinical trial populations – Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART) and Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood (COPSAC2010) – with prospective collection of exposures during pregnancy and early life, that we will leverage to test our hypotheses. This proposal is in response to FOA RFA-OD-16-004, Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) Pediatric Cohorts (UG3/UH3). In these cohorts, we will first determine the patterns of change in the early intestinal microbiome (both composition and metabolic function) up to age 6 years that are related with vitamin D deficiency in the prenatal and perinatal periods. We will also investigate genetic markers of the host that affect these patterns in the intestinal microbiome. We will then investigate the relationship of these patterns of change in the microbiome with the presence of asthma by age 6 years. Findings from this project will point to potential mechanisms by which early environmental exposures interact with the developing intestinal microbiome and the host to confer risk for asthma.","PROJECT NARRATIVE Asthma and allergies are the most common chronic disorders in children. There is a lack of understanding of the risk factors and mechanisms that lead to asthma and allergies. We will investigate the role of two novel risk factors – vitamin D and the intestinal microbiome – on the risk of asthma and allergies in the child, and findings from this important and efficient study could form the basis for development of new and important approaches to reduction of these conditions.",

Maternal smoking during pregnancy adversely affects lung development as seen by lifelong decreases in pulmonary function and increased risk of asthma. In a randomized controlled trial (RCT), published in JAMA, we have provided evidence that maternal vitamin C supplementation (500 mg daily during pregnancy) can decrease the effects of maternal smoking during pregnancy on offspring lung function and the subsequent incidence of wheeze. The purpose of this ECHO application is to combine the offspring from the prenatal cohorts of two RCTs studying the effects of vitamin C supplementation to pregnant smokers on offspring respiratory outcomes and to determine if the innovative therapy of maternal vitamin C supplementation during pregnancy leads to prolonged improvements on offspring’s pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and respiratory health. To begin to understand mechanisms by which prenatal vitamin C may be preventing changes in the health of offspring of smokers, we examined gene specific DNA methylation from a subset of placentas, cord bloods and buccal swabs (ages 2-5) collected from subjects who were the offspring of prospectively-followed pregnant placebo- treated smokers, vitamin C-treated smokers, or non-smokers. In parallel with the effects of vitamin C on the reduction of the effects of maternal smoking on offspring PFTs and wheeze, the supplementary vitamin C prevented the majority of significant changes in DNA methylation induced by maternal smoking in both placentas and cord blood. Strikingly, this prevention of alterations in DNA methylation was still evident 2-5 years later in offspring buccal swabs. This preliminary data suggests that the mechanism underlying vitamin C’s prevention of some of the effects of maternal smoking on offspring pulmonary health involves the prevention of epigenetic changes induced by maternal smoking. Thus this application has 4 specific aims: 1, to create the combined cohort of offspring from the 2 RCTs of vitamin C supplementation to pregnant smokers; 2, to determine if the protective effects of maternal vitamin C supplementation to pregnant smokers on offspring pulmonary health extend to early adolescence; 3, to begin to characterize the epigenetic mechanisms that appear to underlie the effects of smoking during pregnancy on offspring lung health and on the protective effects of vitamin C; and 4, to gather core data for and interact with the overall ECHO study. Respiratory health will be assessed by longitudinal semi-annual, validated respiratory histories and yearly PFTs beginning at 3 years of age. Buccal swabs will be collected yearly and blood at 6, 9 and 12 years to provide DNA for genetic analysis. DNA methylation changes will be measured by methylation chips and bisulfite sequencing. This study will address how smoking during pregnancy affects respiratory outcomes, provide mechanistic and therapeutic insights, and provide subjects and data to ECHO to address other key outcomes.","Narrative Maternal smoking during pregnancy is the largest preventable cause of childhood respiratory illness, and children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy show lifetime decreases in pulmonary function and increased respiratory illnesses and asthma. Sadly, more than 50% of smokers who become pregnant continue to smoke and approximately 20% of expenditures for childhood respiratory illness are caused by maternal smoking amounting to over $1 billion annually in current health care dollars. The purpose of this ECHO application is to combine two prenatal cohorts to study the effects of maternal smoking during pregnancy on respiratory outcomes, determine if the innovative therapy of maternal vitamin C supplementation during pregnancy leads to prolonged improvements on offspring’s pulmonary function tests and respiratory health, and to interact with the greater ECHO cohort to promote childhood health and well-being.",

In trials, lifestyle changes aimed at weight loss were successful at reducing risk of type 2 diabetes (t2DM), the most common type of diabetes. However, long-term weight maintenance in the clinical setting has proved elusive. Importantly, even after successful weight loss, substantial residual risk (~40-50%) remains and may be attributable to other modifiable factors. Several medications used to treat established t2DM have also been studied for t2DM prevention and many have been shown to delay incident diabetes; however, the role of pharmacotherapy for diabetes prevention is not clear. Therefore, there is a continued and pressing need for identification of modifiable risk factors and interventions that are safe, inexpensive and acceptable to prevent t2DM and decrease diabetes-related disease burden. Based on a large body of recently published studies, vitamin D has emerged as a potential determinant of type 2 diabetes (t2DM) risk. In longitudinal observational studies, higher vitamin D status was associated with up to 83% reduction in the risk of t2DM. However, the evidence to support vitamin D supplementation for prevention of t2DM remains inconclusive.

In trials, lifestyle changes aimed at weight loss were successful at reducing risk of type 2 diabetes (t2DM), the most common type of diabetes. However, long-term weight maintenance in the clinical setting has proved elusive. Importantly, even after successful weight loss, substantial residual risk (~40-50%) remains and may be attributable to other modifiable factors. Several medications used to treat established t2DM have also been studied for t2DM prevention and many have been shown to delay incident diabetes; however, the role of pharmacotherapy for diabetes prevention is not clear. Therefore, there is a continued and pressing need for identification of modifiable risk factors and interventions that are safe, inexpensive and acceptable to prevent t2DM and decrease diabetes-related disease burden. Based on a large body of recently published studies, vitamin D has emerged as a potential determinant of type 2 diabetes (t2DM) risk. In longitudinal observational studies, higher vitamin D status was associated with up to 83% reduction in the risk of t2DM. However, the evidence to support vitamin D supplementation for prevention of t2DM remains inconclusive.

The IOM committee also concluded that 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D)  concentrations e20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) were sufficient for bone and overall health. This conclusion has sparked  controversy as a large volume of observational research has found that 25(OH)D concentrations e30 ng/mL  (75 nmol/L) are beneficial for non-bone health outcomes. The resolution of this controversy is important since  almost 20 million older adults (or one-half of the older U.S. adult population) have 25(OH)D concentrations  between 20 and 30 ng/mL. There is growing evidence that vitamin D's effect on reducing falls is mediated by  improvements in neuromuscular function. Observational studies show associations between 25(OH)D  concentrations and muscle strength and physical performance measures associated with fall risk (e.g., gait,  balance).

No pharmacologic therapies reliably prevent or treat AKI. Novel therapeutic targets for clinical intervention are therefore needed.  Vitamin D metabolites have important and potentially beneficial antiinflammatory effects which prevent AKI in animal models. Since vitamin D metabolites are often decreased in critical illness, we propose that deficiencies in the vitamin D axis may be risk factors for incident AKI, and that exogenous vitamin D metabolites may be novel therapeutic agents for AKI prevention. Our preliminary data support these hypotheses. We showed that patients with established AKI have decreased levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25D) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D) in association with elevated fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) levels; the latter is known to suppress both renal and extra-renal conversion of 25D to 1,25D. In further preliminary data, we recently published the results of a pilot RCT demonstrating that administration of a single 2 µg IV dose of 1,25D to critically il patients increases leukocyte mRNA expression of interleukin-10 (IL-10) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). These important antiinflammatory proteins prevent AKI in animal models.  In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will leverage an established ICU cohort to perform the first comprehensive, prospective study to investigate whether 25D, 1,25D, and FGF23 are independent risk factors for adverse renal outcomes among 200 critically ill patients with a high AKI event rate. Primary outcomes will include: incident AKI, assessed by serum creatinine; renal tubular injury, assessed by urinary NGAL and KIM- 1; and need for renal replacement therapy or death. In Aim 2 we will enroll 150 critically ill patients at risk of AKI into a three-arm, double-blind, randomied study of 25D, 1,25D, or placebo to test the effects of repeated doses of vitamin D metabolites on renal and immunomodulatory endpoints. We will test whether 25D and/or 1,25D attenuate incident kidney injury, assessed by time averaged levels of both serum creatinine and urinary NGAL and KIM-1. Further, we will test whether 25D and/or 1,25D increase monocyte mRNA expression of antiinflammatory targets IL-10, HO-1, HIF1a, and thrombomodulin, decrease monocyte mRNA expression of proinflammatory targets ICAM-1 and IL-6, and increase T regulatory (Treg) %, all of which attenuate kidney injury in animal models. Additionally, we will evaluate physiologic endpoints including plasma levels of FGF23 and monocyte mRNA expression of 1-a hydroxylase and 24-hydroxylase to elucidate whether peripheral conversion of 25D to 1,25D is impaired in critical illness.  By unifying a comprehensive, prospective clinical outcomes study and an innovative trial under one thematic umbrella, we will generate novel, clinically relevant insights into the emerging role of vitamin D metabolites in critical illness an AKI that could have important diagnostic and therapeutic implications.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Acute kidney injury is a devastating complication of critical illness.

Despite current available medical and surgical therapies, patients with PAD continue to be at an unacceptably high risk for cardiovascular events and death. Accordingly, interventions to improve morbidity and mortality are critical. Emerging research demonstrates the inter-related effects of inflammation, vascular function and outcomes in PAD. Lifestyle modifications, including exercise and diet, may potentially improve symptoms, as well as modulate factors that influence disease progression and long-term outcomes in these patients. Fish oil has long been recognized to have beneficial effects on cardiovascular health, despite recent controversy. Recent studies have emerged on the role of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) present in fish oil in the termination of inflammation. This role offers new perspectives on the benefits of fish oil consumption. Furthermore, our group recently demonstrated that the omega-3 index, a measure of n-3 PUFA content in red blood cells, is inversely related to inflammation in patients with PAD, and others have shown that n-3 PUFA supplementation can improve vascular function. Hence, overall evidence suggests that fish oil could play a key role in the regulation of inflammatory processes and vascular dysfunction that characterize PAD. My long-term goal is to increase our understanding of how nutritional and lifestyle modifications can reduce the burden of disease in PAD. Accordingly, my goal with the present study is to determine if high-dose n-3 PUFA oral supplementation will improve systemic inflammation, vascular function, and the walking ability of patients with PAD. This will be evaluated using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 70 patients aged e 50 with PAD receiving 4.4 g/day of n-3 PUFA for 3 months. Specific measurements will include markers of both inflammation and termination of inflammation, measures of vascular function, and a walking test.  The study proposed here has the potential to provide important new insights on the role of nutritional interventions in PAD, as well as to improve our understanding of the effects of fish oil supplementation in cardiovascular diseases. It will support the goal of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute of reducing the burden of heart, lung, and blood diseases worldwide. The training plan and study protocol presented here are designed to advance my skills as an independent clinical trialist, supported by a multidisciplinary team of mentors with broad expertise in clinical trials, surgery, biostatistics, vascular biology, and molecular biology. The research will take place at the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center (SFVAMC), one of the most funded and scientifically knowledgeable VA centers in the United States. Furthermore, I will have access to institutional support and resources from both the SFVAMC and UCSF. The training plan, mentorship, and scientific environment will provide me with the resources necessary for the successful completion of this project, and place me on the path to become an independent investigator and leader in my field.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The knowledge obtained from this study could have a significant impact on optimizing medical management of patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) through lifestyle modifications targeting diet.

Endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide or LPS) is a component of coarse and fine mode PM, bioaerosols, tobacco and biomass smoke. Ozone (O3) is the most commonly encountered ambient air pollutant in the US. Epidemiological studies have shown that both LPS and O3 are important asthma triggers. In challenge studies of AAs, we have shown that LPS and O3 induces influx of neutrophils (PMNs) and eosinophils in AAs as well as augmenting response to inhaled allergens. O3 is also an oxidant, and both O3 and LPS increase radical production by airway cells, with both nutritional and genetically defined antioxidant deficiencies (such as the GSTM1 null genotype) being associated with increased risk for pollutant-induced asthma exacerbation. In challenge studies, we have reported that LPS and O3 PMN responses are increased in GSTM1 null volunteers. Gamma tocopherol has known antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions. We have shown that γT prevents allergen, O3 and LPS-induced respiratory tract inflammation in rodents. Our phase I human studies with γT-mT established a dose which maintains γT and its anti-inflammatory metabolites, decreases monocyte responses to LPS and IgE-mediated basophil response to allergen. Data from our initial double-blinded, placebo controlled phase IIa study in healthy volunteers demonstrates that γT-mT inhibits LPS-induced granulocyte influx.

These include: learning to measure and analyze longitudinal stroke outcomes data; developing skills to assess, characterize, and measure white matter hyperintensity volume (WMHV) and cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans; learning about the design, conduct, and analysis of randomized clinical trials; and acquiring skills in mediation analysis techniques. To achieve my training objectives, I have assembled a comprehensive and complementary mentorship team which has worked together and with me for many years. My training objectives will also allow me to develop the skills needed to establish new datasets within ongoing studies during this award period. These subcohorts are necessary to achieve the research goals of the K01 and will provide preliminary data for future grant applications for independent research funding.  I will apply my training to several important research questions during this K01 award. Recently, there has been growing interest in the role that vitamin D as well as omega-3 fatty acids play in the development of cardiovascular disease events. Given the high morbidity burden of stroke, determining the effect of these supplements on stroke outcomes is very important. The NIH sponsored VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) is an ongoing randomized, double blind trial testing vitamin D3 and omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in the primary prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease. I will leverage this ongoing trial and collect additional data on stroke outcomes that would not otherwise be collected by the parent study. In addition, there is growing interest in discovering risk factors fr overall subclinical cerebrovascular disease burden in the brain as measured by WMHV and CMBs. Because WMHV and CMBs are associated with stroke outcomes, understanding risk factors associated with WMHV and CMBs in ischemic stroke patients may identify strategies to reduce the morbidity burden of stroke. I will collect MRI scans performed as part of routine medical care in participants with an ischemic stroke to create a database of WMHV and CMBs in VITAL and the Women's Healthy Study (WHS), a completed trial of the effects of low dose aspirin and vitamin E in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer with ongoing observational follow-up. By using data from both VITAL and WHS, I will have the unique opportunity to study how a wide variety of cardiovascular disease risk factors impact WMHV and CMBs in stroke patients.

In the first funding period (9/29/10-06/30/15), we completed baseline and early follow- up of depression outcomes among nearly 19,000 successfully randomized men and women, aged 50+ years (mean age=65y), who were eligible for incidence or recurrence of late-life depression; nearly 70% of participants have provided pre-randomization blood samples for nutrient biochemical assays. Furthermore, in the Clinical and Translational Science Center (CTSC) component, detailed phenotypic assessments were conducted among a subset of over 1,000 individuals who received in-person structured psychiatric diagnostic interviews, underwent neuropsychological testing, and provided data on dimensional measures of mood, well- being, and social and daily functioning. Finally, another landmark aspect of VITAL-DEP is its substantial racial and ethnic diversity: over 25% of participants are from minority racial and/or ethnic backgrounds, including 19% who are African American. Indeed, our first funding period aims emphasized potential differences in vitamin D response among African Americans, given high risk of low 25(OH)D in this group. However, late- breaking evidence indicates that bioavailable vitamin D is of greatest relevance to race/ethnic differences. In this 5-year renewal proposal, we expand upon what has been achieved in the first period - assembly of a unique trial cohort - and focus on the unprecedented scientific opportunities afforded by this RCT design. Our Primary Aims are: 1) to extend follow-up of mood to examine with high statistical power the long-term (up to 7 years) effects of vitamin D and marine omega-3 fatty acids on depression outcomes among all ~19,000 participants; 2) to examine with high power the impact of biochemical nutrients levels of vitamin D and omega- 3 fatty acids on depression outcomes as well as treatment interaction with baseline biochemical levels. Secondary Aims focus on two critical themes that our particular trial design is uniquely poised to address: 1) racial/ethnic differences in long-term treatment effects; 2) mechanisms, mediators and moderators of mood effects of vitamin D and fish oil in this diverse cohort. Specifically, in a sub-set of 2,000 participants, we will examine relations of bioavailable vitamin D to depression, with attention to race differences in outcomes. Further, among the entire eligible CTSC cohort, we will obtain pre- and post-randomization serum brain- derived neurotrophic factor and targeted plasma metabolite levels to examine biological paths involved in mood responses to vitamin D and fish oil treatment and to test whether biomarker change explains variation in treatment effects. Thus, this proposal not only will ensure comprehensive, definitive testing of the benefits of vitamin D and fish oil for late-life mood but also will inform specific mechanisms involved in a diverse sample.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Biologic and observational evidence supports potential mental health benefits of both vitamin D and marine omega-3 fatty acids. However, it remains unclear whether the use of these supplements can prevent depression or can significantly reduce depressive symptoms in late-life. This ongoing randomized trial, conducted among approximately 19,000 U.S. men and women, respectively aged =50 years =55 years, will: 1) clarify the effects of long-term daily vitamin D and/or omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on late-life depressive symptoms and 2) inform how these agents work to impact mood and for whom.",

The long-term goal of this project is to determine whether maternal folic acid supplementation during pregnancy increases the risk of early childhood asthma and atopy. Supplementation with folic acid, synthetic folate, is recommended during the periconceptional period to prevent neural tube defects (NTD). Studies in different populations have suggested an association between reported folic acid supplementation during pregnancy and increased risk of infant lower respiratory tract infection and early childhood asthma, but data are limited. While adequate intake of folate is essential for prevention of NTDs, it is important to delineate the impact of supplementation on the risk of common respiratory and atopic diseases. Folate plays an important role in DNA methylation, a regulator of gene expression. A causal relationship between folic acid supplementation and respiratory outcomes in children has not been established. However, this relationship does have some biologic plausibility. In a pregnant mouse model, a diet high in methyl donors, including folate, resulted in an augmented allergic phenotype in the offspring, as seen in asthma.  Opportunity and Impact. There is no primary prevention strategy for atopic diseases such as asthma. Our objective is to determine whether higher maternal folate intake or the timing of this intake increases the risk of wheezing, asthma, and other atopic diseases in children. This collective work will characterize maternal folate status using objective measures and will assess childhood wheezing, asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis using validated tools and objective measures. This will be the first investigation in a country with a national fortification program, where individuals may have high intake of folic acid from the diet.  Approach. This work will use complementary retrospective and prospective cohorts of mother-child pairs. Specific aim #1 will investigate the population-based incidence of wheezing and asthma during the first 6 years of life, by the timing of folic acid containing prescriptions filled during pregnancy in a retrospective cohort of 80,000 mother-child dyads from the Tennessee Medicaid population. Specific Aim #2 will determine if a) measured maternal plasma folate levels or b) reported folate intake is associated with prospective development of wheezing, asthma, and/or atopy in the first 5 years of life in mother-child dyads enrolled in the Conditions Affecting Neurocognitive Development and Learning in Early Childhood (CANDLE) cohort.  Innovation and Sustainability. This innovative, cost-efficient project will have the advantages of 1) a well-characterized retrospective cohort with a large number of mother-child dyads and determination of folic acid prescriptions filled by month of pregnancy and 2) a prospective cohort that includes the rich, existing infrastructure of the CANDLE cohort with maternal and infant biospecimens, nutritional data, and prospective follow-up using validated tools and objective measures to assess respiratory and atopic outcomes. This study has potential to inform prenatal recommendations and identify modifiable risk factors for asthma and atopy.","No data",

Despite the profound public health burden, there have been no clinical trials that have attempted to directly address the neurodevelopmental deficits that are so debilitating in FASD. Extensive pre- clinical work (Thomas et al. and others) has provided evidence that choline supplementation is effective in attenuating the neurodevelopmental deficits caused by prenatal alcohol exposure in animal models. Our group has taken the initial steps toward translating this work to humans with two randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled trials. We first conducted a pilot study to ensure the feasibility, tolerability, and safety of choline supplementation in 20 children with FASD (Fuglestad et al, 2013). Next, we completed a study of 40 additional participants with the goals of establishing a target dosage for young children, testing efficacy in the domain of memory, and determining a developmental window for choline's effects (detailed in `preliminary studies').  Briefly, our pilot data revealed that: 1. Children wih FASD consume insufficient dietary choline on average; 2. Choline supplementation was safe, tolerable and feasible for 2-5 year olds; 3. Supplementation for 9 months increased children's explicit memory performance relative to placebo; 4. Significant memory improvement was seen in 2-3 year olds but not 4-5 year olds. For 2-3 year olds, memory improvement was 21 percentage points in the choline arm compared to 2 percentage points in the placebo arm; 5. A dose ranging from 10-19 mg/kg was associated with the largest improvement in memory; 6. A very common single- nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs12325817), related to endogenous choline production, appears to moderate the efficacy of choline for children with FASD.  These findings directly inform the next study. Aim 1 involves evaluating a 19 mg/kg dose in 60 children with FASD, ages 2 to 5. This dosing scheme will optimize the neurocognitive benefits and further enhance tolerability of the intervention. In addition to continuing the evaluation of memory benefits from choline, Aim 2 adds measures of attention and executive function as possible additional targets. The NIH Toolbox Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test and the Executive Function Scale for Early Childhood (pilot-tested during our last study) have been added. Aim 3 adds a longitudinal component - it will evaluate 40 children in the period two years after treatment to determine the permanency of choline's effects. Lastly, Aim 4 will further examine the role of known SNPs in choline synthesis as moderators to the observed treatment effects.  In summary, the proposed study will continue the translation of choline's application - from experimental pre-clinical work to an evidence-based intervention for neurodevelopmental deficits in children with FASD.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is known to contribute to permanent brain damage in the child, yet there are no established treatments. We completed the first two studies of choline supplementation in human children: a feasibility study and a pilot efficacy study. The proposed study will continue that work, determining whether choline supplementation during a specific developmental window when the child's brain remains somewhat plastic is able to attenuate the deficits in thinking, memory, processing speed, and behavior that are common in children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and whether these changes are long- lasting.",

It is predictive of breast cancer risk for at least 10 years in the futue and has been suggested as a surrogate marker of breast cancer risk. Several states now mandate release of mammographic density data to women. However, except for anti-hormonal therapies (e.g., tamoxifen), no interventions have been proven to reduce breast density. Thus, testing promising, well-tolerated interventions that might affect mammographic density is of substantial interest. Several lines of evidence suggest that vitamin D may play a role in breast density and breast carcinogenesis. Vitamin D reduces proliferation and promotes differentiation and apoptosis in breast cells in culture. However, no large-scale randomized studies have examined the impact of vitamin D on mammographic density. We propose to examine the randomized effects vitamin D3 on mammographic breast density in the NIH sponsored VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL), an ongoing randomized, double blind, trial testing vitamin D3 (2,000 IU/day cholecalciferol) and omega-3 fatty acids (840 mg eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA]+ docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) in the primary prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease in a multi-ethnic population of over 24,000 men and women. In this ancillary sub study, mammograms will be obtained on 4000 women age 55-67 years (25% African-American), from baseline (pre-randomization) and after 1 and 4 years of randomized therapy. Centrally processed quantitative mammographic density and texture variation will be measured. We will determine if randomized vitamin D treatment is associated with change in mammographic features, and whether effects are modified by baseline mammographic density, and baseline 25(OH) vitamin D levels. In addition, tissue samples from women in VITAL undergoing breast biopsy/surgery, for both nonmalignant and malignant conditions, will be collected. Quantitative morphological measures, as well as gene expression assays targeting vitamin D activation and breast carcinogenesis pathways, will be performed on collected tissues among women on randomized vitamin D3 compared with placebo. This ancillary study provides a timely opportunity to test comprehensively the effects of vitamin D3 on mammographic features and breast tissue biology in a randomized setting at minimal additional cost.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Thus far, only hormonal therapies such as tamoxifen have been shown to reduce breast density, and these are associated with a high side effect burden. We propose to examine the randomized effects of vitamin D on mammographic breast density and texture in the ongoing, already-funded VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) study. We will collect baseline (pre-randomization), 1-year and 4-year follow-up mammograms, as well as tissue specimens from women undergoing breast biopsy/surgery for malignant and nonmalignant disease, to further elucidate the role of vitamin D on mammographic features and breast tissue biology. Identifying well-tolerated, promising nutritional agents that could reduce breast density would have important public health implications for women at high risk of breast cancer.",

Thiamine deficiency diseases, notably wet and dry beriberi, and Wernicke's encephalopathy, a severe neurological syndrome associated with thiamine deficiency, are associated with many diseases and conditions that result from under-nutrition and malabsorption of thiamine (e.g. alcoholism, bariatric surgery) or hyper-metabolic states (e.g., cancer). However mechanistic studies following a recent and disastrous clinical drug trial (that was terminated because the drug, fedratinib, led to Wernicke's encephalopathy) highlighted the importance of pharmaceutical agents as contributors to thiamine deficiency. That is, fedratinib was shown to be a potent inhibitor of thiamine absorption via the thiamine transporter, SLC19A3. In this research application, we bring together NIH and USDA nutrition supported researchers, in response to PAR-15-024. In particular, we propose to test the hypotheses that commonly used medications inhibit SLC19A3-mediated intestinal absorption of thiamine resulting in drug-vitamin interactions. Secondly, we propose that these drug-thiamine interactions produce a detectable metabolic signature that relates to reduction in the activity of enzymes that are dependent on thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), the active metabolite of thiamine. Our hypotheses are based on exciting preliminary studies in our laboratories demonstrating that several prescription drugs, e.g., metformin, pyrimethamine and amiloride, are inhibitors of SLC19A3. Three aims are proposed: 1. Develop and characterize a humanized transgenic mouse model of SLC19A3 that can serve as an animal model to test drugs for their potential to cause thiamine deficiency. 2. Determine the effects of metformin on the pharmacokinetics and metabolic signatures of thiamine in healthy volunteers using a randomized crossover study; and 3. Use a novel miniaturized assay to screen a 2000-compound library of prescription drugs and bioactives to identify compounds that inhibit SLC19A3 and determine the key structural moieties for SLC19A3 inhibition using quantitative structure activity relationship modeling (QSAR). A multi-tiered approach will be used for the proposed studies including drug-vitamin interaction studies in healthy volunteers; metabolomic methods to identify metabolic signatures of thiamine; small molecule screening to identify inhibitors of SLC19A3; and creation and characterization of humanized mouse models of SLC19A3. Collectively, these novel studies will lead to a new knowledge of drug-vitamin interactions and their metabolic signatures. Specifically, the studies will lead to new tools that can be used in nutrient research and to a recognition that therapeutic drugs may adversely affect thiamine absorption and contribute to thiamine deficiency.","Poor nutrition and many diseases are associated with low levels of vitamin B1 (thiamine), which in turn causes health problems such as delirium and tremors. In this research, we will determine whether therapeutic medications contribute to low levels of thiamine by preventing its absorption in the stomach and intestine. Various research methods, which include human and cellular studies and computer methods will be used.",

Osteoporosis and fractures are major health problems in the U.S. with annual expenditures of $19 billion, and the problem is growing. Our goal is to provide nurses and the wider healthcare community best practice guidelines by contributing evidence as to whether a lifestyle intervention should be implemented for women with low bone mass prior to use of bisphosphonate (BP) medications. In this study, women with low bone mass in the first 5 years of menopause (a time of rapid and significant bone loss) will be randomized to 3 groups (n =103 per group): 1) optimal calcium + vitamin D (optimal CaD) alone (Control); 2) a BP plus optimal CaD (Risedronate); or 3) a three times weekly bone loading exercise program plus optimal CaD (Exercise). Adequate calcium and vitamin D are necessary for bone; however, they frequently are not enough to prevent progression of bone loss in post-menopausal women. Although BPs are indicated for women with osteoporosis, their use is controversial for women with early bone loss. One concern is that long-term use of BPs may increase risk for atypical hip and femur fractures. A bone loading exercise program promotes bone health by improving bone structure and bone formation at sites of mechanical stress as well as by preserving BMD. Comparing effectiveness of exercises with BPs is critical because this will determine whether standard practice should include a trial of exercises prior to BP prescriptions in this at risk population. If an effective exercise program could substitute for, or delay the use of BPs, not only would bone health improve throughout the lifespan, but women would benefit from the many other positive effects of exercise. Our central hypothesis is that after 12 months of participation, improvements in bone strength will be greater in subjects randomized to the Exercise group compared to subjects in either the Control or Risedronate groups. We believe that the best predictor of fracture is bone strength, and strength is determined by bone structure and turnover as well as BMD. Thus, outcomes will include changes in bone structure at the tibia and hip (pQCT and Hip Structural Analysis); BMD at the total hip, femoral neck, and spine; and serum markers of bone formation and resorption. Because adherence to exercises and risedronate may be difficult for subjects to accomplish, education, goal setting, graphic feedback, and targeted strategies for barrier reduction will be used to promote adherence. Dr. Nancy Waltman has over 15 years' experience and 14 publications on the impact of exercise on bone in post-menopausal women. With the addition of Dr. Bilek and other expert consultants and co-investigators, we believe we are well-qualified to conduct this study. Our proposal is consistent with the NINR strategic plan to support research for patient self-management, disease prevention, & application of new technology (Hip Structural Analysis and pQCT).","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Osteoporosis and fractures are major health care problems in postmenopausal women. To prevent fractures and strengthen bones, treatments for low bone mass should improve bone structure and increase bone formation at common sites of fractures as well as maintaining bone mineral density. This study will compare changes in bone strength (bone structure, formation, and bone mineral density) at the hip and spine in women who take 12 months of either: 1) optimal calcium and vitamin D alone; 2) the bisphosphonate 'risedronate' with calcium and vitamin D; or 3) a bone-loading exercise program with calcium and vitamin D.",

Kidney disease is associated with a significantly increased risk of morbidity and mortality even before reaching end-stage kidney disease. Animal studies and observational studies in humans, including studies by investigators leading this proposed study, suggest that vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids may be protective against kidney disease. Despite the evidence base available, there is still no definitive study testing the effects of these relatively safe nutritional supplements on kidney disease progression in humans. We now have an opportunity to provide such data in a highly feasible and cost-efficient manner. We propose to take advantage of the VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) trial to test whether vitamin D3 (at a dose of 2,000 IU/day) or omega-3 fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic acid plus docosahexaenoic acid, 1 gm/day) will preserve kidney function, as measured by serum creatinine and cystatin C, over a 4 year period. The VITAL trial is an NIH funded, placebo-controlled clinical trial randomizing 25,875 participants (men older than 50 and women older than 55 years) in a 2x2 factorial design to vitamin D3 versus placebo and omega-3 fatty acids versus placebo for 5 years to evaluate effects on cardiovascular disease and cancer events. The VITAL trial is not currently planning to evaluate kidney function in participants with hypertension.

We estimate that with these entry criteria, 25% of our 4000 patients will have an eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73m2 and 25% will be ethnic and racial minorities. We will evaluate changes in estimated GFR calculated by serum creatinine and cystatin C levels over a 4 year period, the incidence of end-stage renal disease, prevalent albuminuria at year 4 and parathyroid hormone, calcium and FGF-23 levels at baseline and year 4 in the subset with eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73m2.

But during this life-cycle stage children living in poverty are often vulnerable to negative influences including malnutrition, illnesses, an un-stimulating environments, possibly preventing them from reaching their full potential and perpetuating poverty across generations. Small-scale studies have demonstrated that offering stimulation and nutrition to young children can have positive effects on short and long-term outcomes, such as cognition, self-esteem, depression and other important measures. However it has not yet been demonstrated that these interventions can be scaled-up to form the basis of sustainable and effective policy towards child development. The project will introduce a stimulation program, coupled with micronutrient supplementation, to improve interactions between mothers and their young children with the aim of achieving better child outcomes. The program will follow a systematic weekly curriculum based on the natural developmental stages of the child. It will be implemented in rural communities of Odisha in India, an area where poverty and malnutrition are prevalent. It will be delivered by women from within the communities, which will have been trained for this purpose, in the following forms: (i) weekly individual home visits to the child and its main caregiver/mother, or (ii) in a suitably modified way, within the context of weekly main caregiver/mother and child group meetings. The intervention will be accompanied by an evaluation based on a randomized control trial with five variants including a control group. Data will be collected on child developmental outcomes and detailed maternal- and household-level data before the start, halfway through and at the end of the intervention. Having local women deliver the intervention is key to designing low-cost and sustainable policies. The formation of groups could further reduce costs and enhance the dissemination of good child rearing practices. The aim is to test for effectiveness and to understand the pathways through which these interventions achieve their outcomes.

Prospective clinical data, however, are lacking. Thus, we propose an ancillary study to the Vitamin D and OmegA-3 Trial (VITAL) (U01CA138962), an outcomes trial of vitamin D supplementation in 20,000 men and women (aged ¿60 and 65 years, respectively). Because VITAL lacks any direct assessment of cardiac structure and function, we propose to perform cardiac imaging with echocardiography in 1,000 VITAL subjects pre-randomization and at 3 years. These data may answer several important questions that are not being addressed by the parent trial. Specifically, VITAL is focused on vascular endpoints (myocardial infarction, stroke), raising the possibility that important effects of vitamin D on the heart itself could be missed. Because there is compelling experimental evidence regarding the direct myocardial effects of vitamin D, assessment of cardiac structure and function would provide invaluable clinical and mechanistic insight, regardless of the outcome of the overall parent trial. The investigators have extensive experience in subclinical cardiovascular imaging, coordination of randomized trials (including the parent VITAL study), and clinical and experimental nutritional research. The study represents a unique and cost- effective opportunity to investigate measures of cardiac structure and function in a large, diverse primary prevention trial.","Experimental and epidemiologic evidence suggests that vitamin D has beneficial effects on cardiac structure and function.

ALD is an inherited paroxysmal disease characterized by fatty acid accumulation and subsequent oxidative stress. Forty percent of ALD boys develop inflammatory cerebral demyelination (cerALD) in their first decade of life. Unfortunately, we have no means of identifying boys at risk for cerALD nor do we have any means of preventing the onset of cerebral ALD. These limitations represent enormous gaps in our standard of care for these patients.  To address these limitations, the candidate and his collaborators consider the relationship of several key areas of current knowledge in cerALD: (1) ALD results from a peroxisomal gene defect that causes an accumulation of fatty acids which expose cells to lipid peroxides and other mediators of oxidative stress, (2) monocyte-lineage cells dominate the leading edge of the demyelinating lesions and (3) the lesions shares histologic features with multiple sclerosis lesions, a disease that has been linked to vitamin D insufficiency.  Armed with this knowledge, the candidate has generated preliminary data showing that (1) low serum 25-OH vitamin D levels predict the onset of cerALD; (2) monocytes and brain myelin in ALD males have low glutathione levels compared to controls; (3) the spinal fluid from cerebral ALD boys shows a cytokine expression profile consistent with oxidative stress in monocyte-lineage cells; and lastly, (4) that oral vitamin D3 supplementation in a murine model of autoimmune demyelination significantly reduces clinical disease and increases intracellular glutathione levels in monocytes.  The candidate proposes a pilot trial to study the effect of oral vitamin D3 supplementation on blood and brain biomarkers of oxidative stress in 20 ALD boys who have not yet developed cerebral ALD. In Aim 1 the candidate will use MRI techniques to monitor brain biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation in response to rising vitamin D levels. In Aim 2, the candidate will use 12-color flow cytometry and tandem mass spectrometry to study the effect of oral vitamin D3 supplementation on markers of oxidative stress in the specific immune cell subsets of study participants. In Aim 3, the candidate will use bio banked ALD monocytes to define the metabolic and immunologic pathways linking vitamin D exposure with glutathione and cytokine modulation. The candidate's long term goal is to develop treatments and biomarkers for the prevention of cerebral ALD. The addition of ALD to universal newborn screening panels in an increasing number of US states bolsters the project's immediate relevance.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) affects an estimated 1:17,000 individuals with men more severely affected than women. Nearly 40% of ALD boys develop severe inflammatory cerebral demyelination (cerebral ALD) during the first decade of life, a complication that is often fatal. There is no available treatment for preventing the onset f cerebral ALD. The proposed work expands on the candidate's observation that low pre- morbid serum vitamin D levels with later onset of cerebral ALD. It specifically examines the effect of ora vitamin D3 supplements on markers of oxidative stress in ALD boys. This has implications for the use of vitamin D3 supplements as a preventive therapy for cerebral ALD, which in turn has implications for newborn screening for ALD.",

Recent studies suggest the exciting possibility that vitamin D supplementation, a safe and easy-to-implement therapy in children, may lengthen PCR and increase residual beta cell function (RBCF). However, existing studies employed a suboptimal vitamin D dose or lacked a standardized insulin treatment protocol, precluding solid conclusions and preventing the field from moving forward with translation to clinical practice. This trial's rationale is to securely establish the effect of an adequate dose of vitamin D on PCR and RBCF. We hypothesize that vitamin D will increase RBCF and prolong PCR. The primary aim is to determine the effect of adjunctive vitamin D on RBCF and PCR in youth with T1D maintained on a standardized insulin protocol. We propose a 12-month randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled, parallel design trial of ergocalciferol vs. placebo in 40 subjects of 10-21 years with newly-diagnosed T1D. The primary outcome is the change over time in stimulated C-peptide (a measure of RBCF). Secondary outcomes include change over time in insulin-dose- adjusted-hemoglobin-A1c (HbA1c) (IDAA1C; a measure of PCR), HbA1c, and total daily dose of insulin. Mechanistic studies will explore whether beneficial effects of vitamin D are associated with increased GLP-1 levels or decreased inflammatory markers, and whether response to vitamin D is impacted by T1D-risk polymorphisms. If our hypotheses are true, these findings may completely alter the approach to the early management of T1D, with strong emphasis on prolonging the honeymoon phase using a readily available and easily affordable vitamin D while maintaining these patients on a standardized insulin treatment regimen.","Project Narrative This project is designed to study the role of vitamin D supplementation on the honeymoon phase of type 1 diabetes in children who are on standardized insulin treatment.

"5","R01","AR063910-05","DBP and the bioavailability and function of vitamin D","","31-May-2018","Adams, John S; HEWISON, Martin ","UNITED STATES","314981","2017","AR","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the last ten years there has been a remarkable renaissance in vitamin D research. Two key concepts have underpinned this renewed interest in the health benefits of vitamin D. First is the continuing debate on the worldwide prevalence of vitamin D-insufficiency, and how optimal vitamin D status can be safely achieved through conventional exposure to sunlight and dietary intake. Second is the potential for vitamin D to promote health benefits beyond its classical effects on the skeleton. Following a recent data review, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) has issued statements aimed at addressing some of the key questions concerning our new perspective on vitamin D and human health. The Recommended Dietary Allowance of vitamin D for all age groups was elevated based on bone responses to vitamin D. However, the IOM report also recognized the need for further research to better define 'non-classical' health benefits of vitamin D. The long-term impact of these recommendations is crucially dependent on one question - how does one define vitamin D-sufficiency and -insufficiency? The proposed project describes a new paradigm for quantifying optimal vitamin D and its relation to human health. The overall aim is to demonstrate that vitamin D activity is not simply defined by total serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25D) but instead depends on the bioavailability of this metabolite to target cells and its subsequent conversion to active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D) via the enzyme 1�-hydroxylase (CYP27B1). The proposal hypothesizes that the ability of 25D to access target cells is influenced by its association with the serum vitamin D binding protein (DBP), with 'free' rather than 'DBP-bound' 25D being the bioactive form of this metabolite. The overall objective of the proposal will be to investigate the impact of DBP on the bioactivity of 25D using both mouse and human models. Studies using transgenic, knockout, and humanized mice will investigate how variations in the concentration and vitamin D metabolite binding affinity of DBP affect the response of these mice to 25D and 1,25D under conditions of vitamin D-sufficiency and -deficiency. Data from these experiments will then be related to studies in humans, where DBP concentration and binding affinity are strongly influenced by genetic variations in the DBP gene. Human studies will incorporate analysis of DBP and free 25D/1,25D in a large patient cohort with multiple measures of vitamin D function, but will also involve a pilot supplementation study utilizing parental vitamin D or 25D. These analyses will employ a new mathematical algorithm for determining serum free 25D and 1,25D and will use novel assay technology to physically measure serum levels of free 25D. This model not only puts forward a new paradigm for defining optimal vitamin D status but also aims to highlight a more 'personalized' perspective on vitamin D health that will incorporate both classical and non-classical actions of vitamin D.   .","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vitamin D has been linked to a wide range of human health benefits, but the optimal level of vitamin D required for these effects is far from clear. We have hypothesized that rather than simply measuring total serum concentrations of vitamin D, it is more biologically and clinically relevant to determine free or bioactive levels of serum vitamin D metabolites. To demonstrate this, the proposed project will utilize in vivo mouse and human models in which free serum vitamin D is altered as a consequence of variable expression of the serum vitamin D binding protein, with the overall aim of the project being to present an entirely new paradigm for defining optimal vitamin D status in humans. .",

One of the most common indications for probiotic treatment is the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). Unfortunately, the efficacy of many probiotic products used for AAD is not supported by rigorous independent research, and often results in non-evidence-based usage. Our research group has worked closely with the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) to move research forward for the most well studied Bifidobacterium strain, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (B. lactis) BB-12 (BB-12), via an Investigational New Drug pathway. We have previously conducted two Phase I, safety trials and as per FDA requirements, are now proposing a Phase II trial that will examine efficacy and monitor safety of BB-12 in preventing AAD. The investigational product delivers a stable high dosage of BB-12, consistent with the findings of a Cochrane review for preventing AAD using other strains studied outside of the United States. To explore possible mechanisms responsible for BB-12 effects in ameliorating AAD, we will also study the gut microbiota composition and function by collecting five fecal samples at multiple time points from all participants. The gut microbiota includes hundreds of species of facultative and obligate anaerobes, and its disruption is hypothesized to be an important factor in the development of AAD. AIM 1: To test the efficacy of high dose, BB-12-supplemented yogurt in preventing AAD, compared to yogurt without BB-12, in children receiving antibiotics. Hypothesis: Children receiving antibiotics who receive the yogurt with BB-12 will demonstrate less diarrhea than those receiving a control yogurt without BB-12. AIM 2: To assess the safety of yogurt supplemented with BB-12. Hypothesis: Yogurt containing BB-12 will be safe and well-tolerated in this larger pediatric population. This is a Phase II trial that requires additional safety evaluation of high dose BB-12. AIM 3: To carry out longitudinal community structure and gene expression analysis of fecal microbiota to evaluate the impact of high dose BB-12 in a pediatric population receiving antibiotics. Hypotheses: (i) Administration of antibiotics will alter the composition and gene expression profile of the gut microbiota in pediatric patients, and (ii) concomitant ingestion of BB-12 in yogurt will mitigate the antibiotic- induced disturbance in the gut microbiota, as identified using 16S rRNA and metatranscriptomic profiling. Our long-term goal is to determine the impact of BB-12 on a variety of gastrointestinal disease states and ages, through high-level independent research. Before we proceed with more translational effectiveness research, this Phase II, pediatric efficacy and safety study is required by the FDA.","Project Narrative Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in sufficient amounts, may improve health.

This is a critical question to address as lung infections remain the leading cause of death in persons living with HIV even when they are adherent to ART.

Reducing AAP linked metabolic risks may help cut the 30 years of life lost within this population. Supplemental folate may be a cost effective and low risk method to reduce AAP CVD morbidity and mortality. Folate pharmacogenetics, allows us to mechanistically study AAP metabolic complications and develop personalized medicine within clinical practice. The objective of this project is to compare the effect of folate versus placebo on measures of the metabolic syndrome and CVD risk factors. We will evaluate metabolic laboratory components, and endothelial functioning, in schizophrenia patients receiving AAPs, taking into account pharmacogenetic differences related to folate metabolism. Our primary hypothesis is that folate will attenuate metabolic changes associated with AAP use, thereby contributing to improve endothelial functioning. Variation within the genes facilitating folate metabolism (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and catechol-o-methyl transferase (COMT)) modulate these improvements. We have formulated this hypothesis based on our pilot data obtained during R01MH082784 showing AAPs increase metabolic syndrome risk due to an interaction with MTHFR and COMT. We performed an open-label 3-month folate supplement trial and found significant reductions in metabolic measures and significantly reduced the number of subjects meeting endothelial dysfunction criteria. These improvements were modulated through MTHFR and COMT. The specific aims for this proposal are: 1) Evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness of folic acid supplementation (5mg/day) versus placebo for 16 weeks in schizophrenia subjects and measure sustainability of this effect 8 weeks after supplementation withdrawal, 2) Determine the role of MTHFR and COMT variants on endothelial functioning and metabolic improvements seen with folate supplementation. The innovative approach capitalizes upon a novel strategy to reduce AAP metabolic risks using a novel non-invasive endothelial functioning measurement as a biomarker. This allows for an overall CVD risk estimation compared to focusing on solely weight loss and glucose regulation. The inclusion of pharmacogenomics allows for potential innovative translation of personalized medicine outcomes into practice. Our expected outcomes will demonstrate folate's effectiveness in attenuating metabolic syndrome measures and improvements in endothelial functioning in AAP users with a randomized double blind longitudinal treatment design. Our follow up visit will allow for measurement of any sustained folate effects leading to future dose ranging studies. Successful completion of our pharmacogenetic analyses can be expected to provide a greater mechanistic understanding of AAP metabolic risks.

Gut-derived endotoxins normally penetrate the gut epithelium in only trace amounts due to tightly regulated intestinal barrier function. However, endotoxin leakiness is increased under pathological conditions, including alcohol abuse. The barrier function of intestinal epithelium Is provided in part by paracellular apical junction complexes, including tight and adherens junctions, and by a mucus layer.  In our initial systems biology approach to ALD, we found that intestinal trefoil factor (ITF) was by far the most altered (~50-fold down regulated) protein in the liver following chronic alcohol feeding in rats, and subsequent studies also showed marked down regulation of ITF mRNA and protein in the intestines of alcohol fed mice. ITF plays a critical role in the formation and stabilization of intestinal mucus barrier and enhancement of rapid intestinal repair 'restitution'. Formation and restitution of the barrier is also dependent on uninterrupted mucosal blood flow. Intestinal epithelial cells are positioned between an anaerobic lumen and a highly metabolic lamina propria forming a steep physiologic oxygen gradient. Increased hypoxia- inducible factor (HIF) signaling represents a major adaptive response to hypoxic stress by upregulating a variety of gene products, such as ITF and mucins, to form an integrated epithelial barrier. Our preliminary studies demonstrated that chronic alcohol administration decreases intestinal HIF-2α, ITF and tight junction protein expression resulting in increased endotoxemia and ultimately liver injury. Moreover, supplementation with a probiotic strain, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), increased intestinal HIF-2α and ITF expression, decreased endotoxemia and attenuated alcohol induced liver injury. We hypothesize that alcohol exposure causes detrimental metabolic changes favoring intestinal oxidative stress, inflammation, and alterations of HIF responsive signaling with decreased ITF, leading to intestinal barrier dysfunction, blood endotoxemia and ALD. We postulate that probiotic supplementation will attenuate alcohol-induced intestine and liver injury, in part by increasing HIF-mediated expression of mucus protective factors such as ITF in the intestine. We test our hypothesis with 4 specific aims using in vitro, animal, and human studies approaches. Our ultimate goal is the development of new therapies for ALD. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Alcohol overuse/abuse induces organ injury in multiple organs. This translational research project will examine the mechanisms of the beneficial effects of probiotics on the intestine and the liver in an experimental mouse model of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and in mild human alcoholic hepatitis (AH).","No data",

Low-grade chronic inflammation is a modifiable risk factor. However, it is unknown whether interventions that reduce the levels of inflammatory markers per se improve mobility, or avert decline in mobility in older persons.  To address this gap in evidence we propose the randomized clinical trial ENRGISE (ENabling Reduction of low-Grade Inflammation in SEniors) to test the ability of anti-inflammatory interventions for preventing major mobility disability by improving or preserving walking ability. We have maximized the public health impact of our proposed interventions by selecting interventions that are safe, tolerable, acceptable, and affordable for vulnerable older persons. Based on an extensive literature review, we propose to test the efficacy vs. placebo of the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in the form of fish oil, alone and in combination. Both angiotensin receptor blockers and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have shown to reduce IL-6 in clinical trials and preliminary data suggest that they may improve physical function.  We plan to recruit older persons who are at risk for, or with, mobility impairment, as measured by slow gait speed and self-reported mobility difficulty, and who have elevated levels of IL-6, the marker most consistently associated with mobility limitations. Preliminary data regarding feasibility need to be gathered before such a tria can be effectively designed and implemented. We propose to conduct a feasibility phase that includes performing meta-analyses of existing trials and cohorts, and conducting a pilot trial to assess the effects of the interventions on several inflammatory markers and walking speed. This will allow us to refine the design, recruitment yields, target population, adherence, retention, tolerability, sample-size, and cost for the main ENRGISE trial. We will assemble the multicenter research infrastructure needed for the ENRGISE pilot and main trials, including the biorepository, and we will develop the materials needed for implementing the trials, including the protocol, manual of operations, data and safety monitoring plan, forms, quality control and quality assurance plan, and recruitment and retention materials.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ENRGISE will address critical public health issues regarding mobility disability prevention. We will test the anti- inflammatory effects of widely available and affordable interventions and their impact on mobility in a highly vulnerable population, older adults with elevated levels of inflammation and slow gait speed, at risk of mobility disability.",

Folic acid appears to protect against ASD especially in mothers and children who are genetically susceptible to inefficient folate-dependent one-carbon and methylation metabolism, but this finding needs replication. In addition to being essential for neurodevelopment, folate is a primary methyl-donor for methylation reactions, including DNA methylation. The time near conception is an especially critical period for adequate methyl supply during cycles of active demethylation and re-methylation of the genome during embryogenesis. Our preliminary data show that folic acid supplementation is associated with even greater reductions in ASD risk, by 75%, in younger siblings of children with ASD. In addition, we found DNA methylation differences associated with no maternal use of folic acid supplements in birth tissues (placenta and cord blood) for genes with nuclear regulatory and brain development functions that could have implications for ASD.  The goal of the proposed work is to leverage data and samples from mother-child pairs in two large prospective pregnancy cohorts of high-risk infant siblings to examine specific pathways for prevention of ASD through maternal dietary and supplemental folate intake. This work will build on previous studies by examining exposures collected prospectively, with more accuracy in terms of timing and dose. We will be first to examine whether other methyl-donor B-vitamins have associated effects. We will include information on dietary and supplemental folate and B-vitamin intake from validated instruments, and measurements from maternal first trimester serum, cord blood, and fetal placental tissue. We will examine folic acid interactions with genetic susceptibility factors. Finally, we will increase understanding of the underlying mechanisms by identifying DNA methylation changes associated with folate status, and investigate whether these changes overlap with methylation patterns observed in autistic brains, using innovative methods, multiple platforms, and replication across tissue type and study population, to address challenges associated with DNA methylation measurement. Through completion of the proposed project, we will gain a better understanding of how strongly folic acid is associated with reduced risk of ASD in high-risk families, when intake is most associated and at what levels, how this association differs based on genetic susceptibility, and whether maternal folic acid intake alters DNA methylation profiles in ways that could decrease ASD risk. These findings will have great clinical and public health implications, informing autism prevention trial and ultimately changes in recommendations and policy.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Through completion of the proposed project, we will gain a better understanding of how strongly folic acid and other B-vitamins are associated with reduced risk of ASD in younger siblings within high-risk families, when intake is most associated and at what levels, how the folate association differs based on genetic susceptibility, and whether maternal folic acid intake alters DNA methylation profiles in ways that could decrease ASD risk.

Dr. Sen has already shown that she is committed to becoming a leader in the field of maternal obesity research. This career training award would allow her to pursue formal training through a Master's degree in Clinical and Translational Research, with a focus on designing interventions and conducting clinical trials to improve maternal and neonatal outcomes in obese pregnancy. She will benefit from the experience of an expert mentoring team. Her primary mentor will be Dr. Simin Meydani, Professor of Nutrition and Immunology at Tufts University and a renowned expert in micronutrient intervention studies. Her co-mentors will be Dr. Marlene Goldman, an expert in antioxidant interventions and reproductive health, Dr. David Greenblatt, an expert in pharmacologic interventions and obesity and Dr. Norma Terrin, an expert in clinical trial design. Dr. Diana Bianchi and Dr. Jonathan Davis will serve as career mentors. The academic environment at Tufts University and The Department of Pediatrics at Tufts Medical Center/Floating Hospital for Children is an ideal training environment, with an established track record of successfully transitioning junior faculty to independent researchers. In addition, Tufts University and the Jean Mayer USDA HNRCA provide an unparalleled combination of resources, core facilities, intellectual expertise and potential collaborations in nutrition and obesity research. The proposed research project, 'BMI-based prenatal vitamins to ameliorate oxidative stress in obese pregnancy,' is a novel intervention aimed at decreasing oxidative stress and inflammation, key abnormalities in the intrauterine milieu of obese pregnancy. Dr. Sen previously identified the importance of oxidative stress in the causative pathway of intergenerational obesity in an animal model, and her pilot data shows that oxidative stress is markedly increased, and anti-oxidant defenses markedly depleted, in obese pregnant women. This trial is a logical extension of this previous work. Her central hypothesis is that obese pregnancy is characterized by an oxidant/anti-oxidant imbalance, which increases inflammation and adversely impacts maternal health and neonatal outcome. Restoring oxidant/anti-oxidant balance with a body mass index-based prenatal micronutrient supplement will decrease oxidative stress and inflammation and improve both maternal and neonatal outcomes in obese pregnancy. This hypothesis will be tested in a randomized controlled trial in obese pregnant women. Given its overwhelming current and future impact, innovative approaches to diminish the effect of maternal obesity on future generations are of paramount public health importance.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: One out of three pregnant women is obese, predisposing the next generation to obesity and metabolic dysregulation. Interventions to ameliorate the adverse effects of obese pregnancy are of paramount importance in arresting the propagation of this vicious cycle. Since oxidant/antioxidant balance appears to play a critical role in transgenerational obesity, a BMI-based antioxidant vitamin supplement will be given to obese mothers during pregnancy and biochemical and clinical outcomes will be followed, making the proposed study a safe and inexpensive approach to significantly impact a condition that the WHO has stated is the most important public health problem facing the world today.",

In order to meet these goals we are proposing a  gold standard  investigation with a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.  Briefly, we will enroll 2300 HIV-infected pregnant women at 12-27 weeks gestation who are enrolled in the Management and Development for Health (MDH) President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) program in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania.

Obese children (BMI 95th percentile) and overweight children (BMI 85th-94th percentile) exhibit CVD risk factors and a relatively high prevalence of hypovitaminosis D, and their atherogenic risks track from childhood to adulthood. Therefore, vitamin D replenishment in vitamin D-deficient obese and overweight children has the potential to improve their cardiometabolic health and reduce their risk of CVD later in life. In this proposa, we will test the central hypothesis that enhancement of vitamin D status in such children will improve their vascular health and their CVD and metabolic syndrome risk profile. Our primary objective is to determine, in obese and overweight children aged 10 to 18 years with vitamin D deficiency (defined as serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <20 ng/mL), the efficacy of enhanced vitamin D3 supplementation in improving vascular endothelial function, arterial stiffness, insulin sensitivity, and metabolic syndrome risk status; and to assess whether these effects are dose- dependent. As a secondary objective, we will examine the vitamin D supplementation-induced effect on adipokines and inflammatory markers relevant to CVD risk. In a double-masked, controlled trial, we will randomize 252 eligible children to receive either 600 IU (conventional supplementation), or 1000 IU or 2000 IU (enhanced supplementation) of vitamin D3 daily for 6 months. Study outcome measures, assessed at baseline, 3 and 6 months, will include (1) brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) as a measure of vascular endothelial function; (2) pulse wave velocity as a measure of arterial stiffness; (3) surrogate estimates of insulin sensitivity (fasting glucose/fasting insulin ratio or Homeostasis Model of Assessment - Insulin Resistance [HOMA-IR]); (4) metabolic syndrome risk factors (blood pressure, waist circumference, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and fasting blood glucose); (5) inflammatory markers (e.g. CRP, IL-6, TNF-alpha); (6) adipokines (leptin and adiponectin); and (7) nitric oxide metabolites. Brachial FMD at 6 months will be the primary outcome measure. We will assess the safety of enhanced vitamin D3 supplementation by measuring serum calcium at the 3- and 6-month-follow-ups. Total body fat will be ascertained by Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry to examine the confounding effects of adiposity on outcome measures. Innovative aspects of this proposal include (1) characterizing the temporal changes in vascular health and cardiometabolic risk outcomes in response to enhancement of vitamin D status in a population of children at high-risk for vascular dysfunction and cardiometabolic risks; and (2) delineating the vitamin D effects on inflammatory markers and adipokines relevant to CVD risk. Establishing the protective benefits of vitamin D would have major public health importance, since optimization of vitamin D status would be an inexpensive primary prevention strategy for improving cardiometabolic health during childhood and for reducing CVD risk during adulthood.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal is relevant to public health because demonstrating the cardiovascular and metabolic benefits of vitamin D status enhancement could have significant public health impact - as vitamin D status optimization could be implemented as an inexpensive primary prevention strategy for improving cardiovascular health.",

Neural tube defects (NTDs) are among the most common and serious of all birth defects affecting 0.5-1 per 1,000 US newborns, yet their complex etiology remains poorly understood (Wallingford et al., 2013). It is well established that pre-pregnancy supplementation with folic acid can reduce the risk of NTDs, but the underlying mechanism of this beneficial effect is unclear. Approximately 30% of NTDs cannot be prevented by maternal periconceptional folate supplementation. Our preliminary data showed that rare mutations in planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway could increase the risk of NTDs, while mutagens such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were enriched in the placentas of NTDs fetuses/infants. We hypothesized that NTDs are caused by combinations of rare multiple mutations. Higher mutation rates results in a higher NTDs prevalence. It is possible that folic acid can prevent NTDs by reducing the mutation rate. Furthermore, we hypothesize that paternal supplementation with folic acid can further reduce NTD rates. We have a unique opportunity to evaluate folate supplement effect on mutation rate by leveraging previously collected biological samples from NTD patients and controls from several distinct cohorts. Additionally, we propose to use mouse models to better understand the relationship between folate and mutation rates in vivo. The results of this study will provide an explanation of how folate prevents NTDs, and will reveal novel pathways for intervention on folate-resistant NTDs. Hence, the successful completion of the proposed studies is likely to have substantial impact on our understanding of conditions that affect ~6% of births worldwide and constitute one of the major healthcare concerns for the youngest members of society.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Folic acid supplementation has proven to be an effective intervention in the prevention of neural tube defects (NTDs).

In this application, we propose to examine the role of the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin, and its primary regulator vitamin D, in lung function impairment, respiratory infections and acute exacerbations of COPD as well as evaluate the effect of oral vitamin D supplementation on lung cathelicidin levels in humans. Cathelicidin has bactericidal and inflammatory activities in the lung and is regulated by vitamin D levels. Our hypothesis is that reduced cathelicidin levels are associated with accelerated lung function decline though a pathway partially mediated by increased infections and COPD exacerbations. We hypothesize the effect of cathelicidin on lung function is greater in those with vitamin D insufficiency and that oral vitamin D supplementation will raise cathelicidin levels in the pulmonary compartment, thereby restoring lung cathelicidin deficiency. Specifically, through longitudinal investigation nested within an ongoing cohort study of urban, predominantly African-American individuals at high risk for development of OLDs, we will characterize the rate of lung function decline in 380 participants followed with serial spirometry measures for up to six years. Baseline and repeated measures of cathelicidin and vitamin D will be examined as independent predictors of lung function decline and respiratory infections. Separately, using longitudinal data from 2100 participants enrolled in the Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study (SPIROMICS) study with established COPD, baseline measures of blood cathelicidin and vitamin D will be examined as an independent predictor of longitudinal FEV1 decline and COPD exacerbations over three years. In both cohorts, concurrent vitamin D measurements will permit evaluation of antecedent and modifier on the cathelicidin-lung outcomes relationships. Finally, we will measure blood and lung lavage cathelicidin levels in 40 vitamin D insufficient individuals before and after eight weeks of oral vitamin D supplementation to determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on cathelicidin levels. Completion of these aims will provide a robust determination of the role of cathelicidin in lung function decline and adverse pulmonary outcomes in unique populations of at-risk and diseased individuals. Moreover, the aims of this application directly or indirectly wor towards ultimately understanding if a readily measurable blood marker, cathelicidin, can inform who may benefit from vitamin D supplementation to prevent chronic lung disease. The results from this application would lead to a therapeutic intervention study that will provide further opportunities to improve our understanding of the relationship between vitamin D, cathelicidin and lung function.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal will evaluate a potential mechanism of increased risk of lung function impairment, as well as determine if vitamin D replacement can alter this pathway.

Observational studies showed a higher risk of death in HF patients with lower levels of vitamin D and two recent post-hoc analyses of trials conducted in mostly post- menopausal women reported a reduction in HF rates in the vitamin D group compared with placebo. Vitamin D has also been reported to improve hemodynamics and left ventricular remodeling in 229 HF patients. However, no randomized trial has examined the effects of vitamin D on primary prevention of HF or on the rate of recurrent HF decompensation in men and women.

Most active TB cases arise in adults as a consequence of reactivation of a latent TB infection (LTBI) acquired in childhood. An estimated 2.3 billion people have LTBI, including 10-15 million people in the US. WHO aims to eliminate TB as a public health problem by 2050, and this will require measures to prevent acquisition of LTBI. Vitamin D has long been known to enhance innate immunity to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), and Phase 2 clinical trials show that vitamin D supplementation enhances innate immune resistance to MTB infection. We propose to conduct a Phase 3 double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial to determine whether vitamin D supplementation reduces risk of acquisition of LTBI in 7,350 uninfected schoolchildren aged 6-15 years in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, where rates of LTBI acquisition in children are particularly high as is vitamin D deficiency. Study medication will be administered over 3 years as 72 directly observed bi-weekly oral doses of 28,000 IU Vitamin D3 or placebo. We will employ a well-validated interferon-gamma release assay to determine whether participants have acquired LTBI at 3 years of follow-up (primary outcome). There is professional consensus, as highlighted in recent editorials in the Lancet [2011; 377:189-90] and PNAS [2011; 108, 18861-18862], that the trial we propose needs to be conducted. The PNAS editorial concludes that 'It is a tragic irony that vitamin D, which costs a penny a day and may enhance innate and acquired immunity to TB, is not considered a worthy investment for critical clinical trials that could determine whether supplementation can prevent disease.' The results of this trial will inform global TB control policy by determining whether vitamin D supplementation prevents acquisition of LTBI. More than one billion people worldwide are Vitamin D deficient, and supplementation is safe and inexpensive: intermittent bolus doses of vitamin D are effective in correcting deficiency, are inexpensive, easy to administer, have a very low incidence of adverse effects and much higher degree of acceptability than vaccines and antibiotics. The results of our trial will be readily generalizable to the vitamin D deficient populations at risk of TB worldwide and to the billions already infected with LTBI.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tuberculosis is posing a global emergency; an astonishing one-third of the global population, including 10-15 million people in the United States, are afflicted with a latent TB infection from Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

Despite compelling evidence implicating vitamin D in CRC, critical questions remain about whether these findings reflect a true causal relationship, and what the biological mech- anisms of vitamin D activity are. Our central hypothesis is that vitamin D supplementation to achieve sufficient levels of 25(OH)D leads to improved survival in CRC patients and influences several neoplastic pathways that can be exploited as biomarkers of efficacy and targets for novel treatment strategies. We will test this hypothe- sis within two novel randomized clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation: a) a phase II double-blind random- ized trial of high- versus low-dose vitamin D3 in combination with chemotherapy in patients with metastatic CRC, and b) a randomized trial of preoperative high-dose vitamin D3 versus placebo in patients with resectable colon cancer for examination of vitamin D biology in fresh human tumor tissue. We will also lever- age a rich prospective cohort of metastatic CRC patients enrolled in a completed NCI-sponsored phase III trial of chemotherapy (CALGB/SWOG 80405) to further define and validate biomarkers of vitamin D action. In Aim 1, we will determine the impact of supplemental vitamin D on survival of CRC patients, test distinct hypotheses about the vitamin D dose-response relationship, and explore biomarkers of vitamin D status, response, and efficacy. We will investigate whether circulating levels of vitamin D binding protein and tumoral expression of vitamin D receptor, 1α-hydroxylase, and 24-hydroxylase are associated with improved survival within our ran- domized trials, and whether these markers modify the relationship between vitamin D and patient outcome. In Aim 2, we will conduct a precision medicine analysis of vitamin D to elucidate the mechanistic basis for its anti- tumor activity in CRC. We will explore the impact of vitamin D supplementation on tumoral markers of inflam- mation, lymphocytic infiltrates, and inflammatory gene signatures in surgical colectomy specimens from pa- tients treated with high-dose preoperative vitamin D3 versus placebo. We will also perform next generation se- quencing and Nanostring analysis of tumors from CRC patients with high- versus low vitamin D status to identi- fy unique genetic and transcriptional signatures associated with vitamin D-mediated carcinogenesis. In sum- mary, this translational proposal leverages innovative randomized trials of vitamin D to take the next critical steps in understanding vitamin D activity and biology in CRC. Our findings will confirm causality, provide new insights into biomarkers of vitamin D activity, and lead to potential inclusion of vitamin D into standard therapy – including immunotherapy – with the ultimate goal of improving the survival of patients with CRC.","PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the U.S., and may plausibly be linked to vitamin D deficiency. Abundant preclinical and epide- miologic data link lower levels of vitamin D to increased risk of and mortality from colorectal cancer; this is par- ticularly relevant given increasing rates of vitamin D deficiency in the U.S., as well as profound racial disparities in vitamin D status and colorectal cancer incidence and mortality. In an era of expensive and often toxic anti- neoplastic drugs, vitamin D therefore represents an attractive and accessible treatment option for patients of all races and sociodemographic groups with respect to both safety and cost.",

Because traditional CVD risk factors do not fully explain the link between CKD and CVD, it is likely that 'non-traditional' risk factors that are altered in CKD may be involved. Among such factors, higher serum phosphorus (Pi) levels represent a causal candidate, and may be modifiable.  Higher serum Pi induces arterial calcification, arterial stiffness, and left ventricular hypertrophy in animals. Similar fidings are observed in humans, and higher Pi levels are also associated with the development and progression of CKD, CVD events and mortality in humans. The KDIGO international clinical practice guidelines recommend targeting Pi within the normal range and recommends using oral phosphorus binders (OPBs) to do so. However, since the recommendations were published, studies have consistently shown that OPBs have minimal efficacy for Pi lowering in CKD stage 3-4, even with very high doses and pill burden, and may be associated with harm. In contrast, animal studies and pilot studies in humans show that nicotinamide (vitamin B3) substantially lowers serum Pi levels, and can do so with only 1-2 pills/day. Nicotinamide reduces Pi through a different mechanism. Rather than binding Pi, it blocks intestinal Pi absorption by down-regulating a key intestinal Pi transporter. The lipid drug niacin contains both nicotinamide and nicotinic acid, and we have shown that it lowers Pi in CKD patients. However, nicotinamide alone may have advantages. Unlike niacin, it does not cause flushing, liver test abnormalities, hyperuricemia, or insulin resistance. Nicotinamide has considerable long-term safety data in the general population, is available over the counter as a dietary supplement in the US, and would cost about $2/patient/month. Thus, nicotinamide may provide a readily available, well-tolerated, inexpensive, and convenient method to lower serum Pi levels in patients with CKD.  However, the efficacy of nicotinamide for Pi lowering in CKD stage 3-4 is unknown. Moreover, the effects of nicotinamide on other components of mineral metabolism including urine phosphorus excretion and counter- regulatory hormones FGF23, PTH, and calcitriol are unknown. Changes in these factors may have their own influences on CVD, CKD progression, and bone health. Thus, nicotinamide is not yet ready for widespread clinical use in CKD patients. The efficacy for Pi lowering and effects on other components of mineral metabolism must first be established.  We propose a phase 2, randomized double blind placebo controlled study among 150 patients with eGFR 20-45ml/min/1.73m2 treated with nicotinamide or placebo for 6 months. Our primary aims are to determine (1) the Pi lowering efficacy, (2) the effects of nicotinamide on other components of mineral metabolism including urine phosphorus excretion and Pi regulatory hormones. If effective and well tolerated, this study will rapidly alter the standard of care by introducing icotinamide for Pi lowering in CKD stage 3-4.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Most patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) die of cardiovascular disease (CVD) before they ever progress to kidney failure, retention of serum phosphorus is a potential explanatory factor, and clinical practice guidelines suggest keeping serum phosphorus concentrations within the normal range in CKD patients. Existing therapies to lower phosphorus in CKD are minimally effective, and may cause harm. We have identified an inexpensive, readily available, convenient vitamin (nicotinamide) that substantially lowers serum phosphorus. This study will establish the phosphorus lowering efficacy of nicotinamide, and its effects on other components of mineral bone disease in CKD patients.",

Low-grade chronic inflammation is a modifiable risk factor. However, it is unknown whether interventions that reduce the levels of inflammatory markers per se improve mobility, or avert decline in mobility in older persons.  To address this gap in evidence we propose the randomized clinical trial ENRGISE (ENabling Reduction of low-Grade Inflammation in SEniors) to test the ability of anti-inflammatory interventions for preventing major mobility disability by improving or preserving walking ability. We have maximized the public health impact of our proposed interventions by selecting interventions that are safe, tolerable, acceptable, and affordable for vulnerable older persons. Based on an extensive literature review, we propose to test the efficacy vs. placebo of the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in the form of fish oil, alone and in combination. Both angiotensin receptor blockers and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have shown to reduce IL-6 in clinical trials and preliminary data suggest that they may improve physical function.  We plan to recruit older persons who are at risk for, or with, mobility impairment, as measured by slow gait speed and self-reported mobility difficulty, and who have elevated levels of IL-6, the marker most consistently associated with mobility limitations. Preliminary data regarding feasibility need to be gathered before such a tria can be effectively designed and implemented. We propose to conduct a feasibility phase that includes performing meta-analyses of existing trials and cohorts, and conducting a pilot trial to assess the effects of the interventions on several inflammatory markers and walking speed. This will allow us to refine the design, recruitment yields, target population, adherence, retention, tolerability, sample-size, and cost for the main ENRGISE trial. We will assemble the multicenter research infrastructure needed for the ENRGISE pilot and main trials, including the biorepository, and we will develop the materials needed for implementing the trials, including the protocol, manual of operations, data and safety monitoring plan, forms, quality control and quality assurance plan, and recruitment and retention materials.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ENRGISE will address critical public health issues regarding mobility disability prevention. We will test the anti- inflammatory effects of widely available and affordable interventions and their impact on mobility in a highly vulnerable population, older adults with elevated levels of inflammation and slow gait speed, at risk of mobility disability.",

Evidence for a role of these agents in preventing cancer, CVD, and other diseases remains inconclusive regarding causality and insufficient to inform nutritional recommendations for primary prevention. Appropriately designed randomized trials in general populations are lacking. To fill this knowledge gap, we have been conducting VITAL, a highly innovative, cost-efficient, large-scale, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical tria among 26,000 U.S. men and women without cancer or CVD at baseline, who have been selected only on age (men aged e50 and women aged e55), with an oversampling of blacks (ne5000). In a 2x2 factorial design, participants have been randomized to vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol, 2000 IU/d) and marine omega-3 fatty acids (Omacor(R) fish oil, 1 g/d, containing eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] + docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) supplements (or placebos) independently. Contingent on continued funding, the median treatment period will be 5 years. During the first cycle, we have successfully met or surpassed our recruitment goals, enrolled a racially/ethnically diverse cohort, collected baseline blood/DNA samples on >16,000 participants (with plans for follow-up bloods in 6000), and conducted extensive validation studies of the laboratory assays for vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid measurements in the trial. Annual follow-up questionnaires assess treatment compliance (confirmed by blood samples in a subset of participants), side effects, endpoint occurrence, and cancer and vascular risk factors. Self-reported endpoints are confirmed by medical record review by physicians blinded to treatment assignment, and deaths are ascertained through the National Death Index-Plus and other sources. Our archived blood samples allow assessment of effect modification by baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid levels, changes in biomarkers over time, and testing of genetic/biochemical hypotheses. With our scientific colleagues, we have obtained funding for 18 ancillary studies to evaluate the role of these supplements in preventing other chronic diseases (including diabetes, cognitive decline, depression, and autoimmune disorders), and established an in-clinic component for in-depth phenotyping of a subcohort (n=1000). The trial is expected to provide either definitive positive or informative null results for our primary hypotheses and will serve as a national resource for research on the health effects of vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids, with opportunities for extensive collaborations.

In recent meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials in humans, daily aspirin use reduced incidence, metastasis and mortality from several common types of cancer, especially colorectal cancer. The mechanism(s) by which aspirin exerts an anticancer benefit is uncertain; numerous effects have been described involving both cyclooxygenase-dependent and -independent pathways. The goal of this research is to elucidate the key metabolic changes that are responsible for the anticancer effects of aspirin in humans using untargeted metabolomics analysis. Metabolomics, or global metabolite profiling, is an emerging discipline that has the potential to transform the study of pharmaceutical agents. Our innovative approach will use high-resolution mass spectroscopy to detect thousands of metabolites in blood plasma and normal colon mucosa biopsies that were collected from participants in the Aspirin/Folate Polyp Prevention Study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of aspirin and/or folic acid supplementation for the prevention of colorectal adenomas. Participants in the trial were assigned with equal probability to three aspirin treatment arms (placebo, 81 mg, or 325 mg daily). Over the three-year treatment period, 81 mg/day of aspirin reduced the risk of adenomas, whereas the 325 mg/day dose had less effect. The aims of the current proposal are to identify metabolomic signatures, including specific metabolites and metabolic pathways, that are associated with aspirin treatment in blood and normal colon mucosal tissue of participants after three years of randomized aspirin treatment; and then to assess the associations of these metabolic signatures with adenoma risk and whether they mediate the reductions in risk due to 81 mg/day aspirin treatment. We will prioritize metabolites for study by evaluating metabolite levels in patients from the placebo and treatment arms while controlling the false discovery rate, use correlation analysis to enhance identification of relevant metabolic modules associated with these prioritized metabolites, and apply pathway mapping with post-hoc application of ion dissociation spectroscopy to representative metabolites to confirm pathway identification. Because aspirin is a multifunctional drug that is thought to modify numerous pathways with potential roles in carcinogenesis, a global discovery-based metabolomics approach is the best way to identify its key activities. The public health significance of this work is substantial because understanding the mechanism of aspirin's anticancer effects is key to optimizing its use and to the development of novel drugs targeting the metabolic pathways identified.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  A critical gap in our understanding of the mechanistic basis for aspirin's anticancer effects will be addressed in the current research proposal. We will use a discovery-based approach (metabolomics) to elucidate the metabolic effects of aspirin in human blood and colon tissue that are responsible for the observed reduction in risk of colorectal adenomas due to aspirin treatment in a randomized clinical trial. The research is key to optimizing the use of aspirin in cancer prevention, and potentially treatment, and in reducing the large public health burden of this disease.",

Obesity is a complex disorder and there are likely multiple causative factors emerging at various times through life. We have previously demonstrated in preclinical studies that offspring have altered metabolism when the fetuses are exposed to the consequences of maternal obesity in utero. The major effects relate to how the offspring metabolize energy and store excess energy. Offspring of obese women can spare and store more ingested energy as excess fat than offspring of lean women who burn more of their energy. Preliminary data from our ongoing clinical studies show that offspring of overweight women have increased fat mass at age 2 weeks and increased weight at age 2 years. One in two American infants will have been exposed to adverse metabolic conditions while developing in utero, and this increases the risk of developing obesity later in life. Although weight loss prior to pregnancy would be the preferred line of action, in light of the high incidence of unplanned pregnancies and the low success rate of significant weight loss among women, one critical strategy is to develop interventions during pregnancy to prevent childhood obesity.  The objective of this proposal is to test an intervention that would reduce the effect of maternal obesity on the offspring and therefore prevent their risk of developing childhood obesity. The proposed study will test the efficacy of probiotics supplementation during pregnancy on preventing childhood obesity. To test these hypotheses we have designed a prospective randomized double blinded control trial. For this study we will recruit 104 obese women within the first 12 weeks of gestation and follow them throughout pregnancy and during their child's first two weeks of life. The obese women will be randomized to either a placebo (N=52) or to an intervention group (N=52). The intervention group will consist of a daily probiotic supplementation, whereas the control group will be administered a placebo. During the length of the study we will: carefully quantify maternal and child adiposity (fat mass); study maternal metabolism (dietary intake and energy expenditure); acquire dietary intakes and evaluate circulating levels of key metabolic markers. The specific aims will first demonstrate the potential for a probiotic intervention during gestation to improve maternal glucose use in obese women. For this aim, maternal fasting glucose and insulin levels will be assessed throughout pregnancy in the intervention group compared to the placebo group. The specific aims will also test whether a probiotic intervention during pregnancy in obese women alter offspring fat mass and decrease the risk of obesity in the offspring. To answer these questions, placenta, umbilical cord and cord blood will be obtained to study glucose, insulin and gene expression.","No data",

In this application, we propose to examine the role of the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin, and its primary regulator vitamin D, in lung function impairment, respiratory infections and acute exacerbations of COPD as well as evaluate the effect of oral vitamin D supplementation on lung cathelicidin levels in humans. Cathelicidin has bactericidal and inflammatory activities in the lung and is regulated by vitamin D levels. Our hypothesis is that reduced cathelicidin levels are associated with accelerated lung function decline though a pathway partially mediated by increased infections and COPD exacerbations. We hypothesize the effect of cathelicidin on lung function is greater in those with vitamin D insufficiency and that oral vitamin D supplementation will raise cathelicidin levels in the pulmonary compartment, thereby restoring lung cathelicidin deficiency. Specifically, through longitudinal investigation nested within an ongoing cohort study of urban, predominantly African-American individuals at high risk for development of OLDs, we will characterize the rate of lung function decline in 380 participants followed with serial spirometry measures for up to six years. Baseline and repeated measures of cathelicidin and vitamin D will be examined as independent predictors of lung function decline and respiratory infections. Separately, using longitudinal data from 2100 participants enrolled in the Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study (SPIROMICS) study with established COPD, baseline measures of blood cathelicidin and vitamin D will be examined as an independent predictor of longitudinal FEV1 decline and COPD exacerbations over three years. In both cohorts, concurrent vitamin D measurements will permit evaluation of antecedent and modifier on the cathelicidin-lung outcomes relationships. Finally, we will measure blood and lung lavage cathelicidin levels in 40 vitamin D insufficient individuals before and after eight weeks of oral vitamin D supplementation to determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on cathelicidin levels. Completion of these aims will provide a robust determination of the role of cathelicidin in lung function decline and adverse pulmonary outcomes in unique populations of at-risk and diseased individuals. Moreover, the aims of this application directly or indirectly wor towards ultimately understanding if a readily measurable blood marker, cathelicidin, can inform who may benefit from vitamin D supplementation to prevent chronic lung disease. The results from this application would lead to a therapeutic intervention study that will provide further opportunities to improve our understanding of the relationship between vitamin D, cathelicidin and lung function.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal will evaluate a potential mechanism of increased risk of lung function impairment, as well as determine if vitamin D replacement can alter this pathway.

This proposal will assess interventions aimed at preventing CTIBL in postmenopausal breast cancer patients caused by aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy, which results in a 2- to 4-fold increase in bone loss and significantly increase fracture risk in this population. The research project will tet the efficacy of high-dose vitamin D supplementation plus a personalized weight-bearing exercise program to prevent CTIBL. Career Development Plan: Dr. Peppone's previous experience as an epidemiologist specializing in cancer, combined with his ongoing training as a clinical cancer control researcher, makes him well-suited to become a independent researcher with a focus on the pathogenesis and treatment of CTIBL. His training goals will expand upon his knowledge and are divided into three training aims: 1) to develop expertise in the biology, physiology, genetics, and measurement of CTIBL, 2) to gain experience as a PI in the design, conduct, and analysis of Phase II/III randomized controlled clinical trials, and 3) to gain experience in the testing and implementation of a nutritional supplement intervention (vitamin D) and behavioral interventions (exercise) for CTIBL.

The mortality in this group of patients is unacceptably high. A majority of the deaths are due to cardiovascular diseases, followed by infectious complications and protein-energy wasting. Strategies to reduce the mortality of MHD patients, including those directed at traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as statins, have largely been ineffective. Inflammation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and protein-energy wasting. Biomarkers of the inflammatory state such as       C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are elevated in MHD patients and are also robust predictors of cardiovascular events and mortality in this patient population. While anti-inflammatory interventions, especially specific anti-cytokin therapies have been used successfully to treat patients with inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, and while encouraging studies have been reported in improving glycemic control and beta cell function in type 2 diabetes, there are only limited studies using these interventions in MHD patients. Our investigative group has performed a series of studies investigating the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of a number of anti-inflammatory therapies in MHD patients, including Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), Fish Oil (EPA+DHA), Vitamin E (gamma-tocopherol), alpha lipoic acid (ALA) and CoEnyzme Q10 in studies ranging from 14 patients to 300 patients.

Vitamin D can influence the regulation of genes responsible for metabolism and transport processes that mediate xenobiotic clearance. This is highly relevant since vitamin D treatment is common, as deficiency (total 25(OH)D level <30 ng/mL) is observed in up to 90% of CKD cohorts. Previous published research by the Principal Investigators and others has shown that renal and nonrenal xenobiotic clearance pathways mediated by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and transporters is altered in CKD. Given the 24 M US citizens with CKD are prescribed an average of 10-12 different medications daily, the clinical realities of altered xenobiotic clearance in CKD (drug interactions, side effects, altered efficacy, and confusion for clinicians prescribing and/or monitoring treatments) are not trivial. Importantly, increasing evidence indicates that vitamin D deficiency is a significant non-traditional cardiovascular risk factor, and vitamin D is important or bone and musculoskeletal health, kidney protection, cancer prevention, and decreased severity or risk of autoimmune and infectious diseases. In this proposal, we developed a translational study employing in vivo and in vitro studies to investigate how vitamin D alters the activity of drug metabolism and transport pathways in CKD. We propose to characterize the in vivo activity of xenobiotic metabolism and transport pathways in CKD patients and healthy controls under the opposing influences of vitamin D deficiency and repletion. Moreover, physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models will explore mechanisms for vitamin D and uremia on variations in drug metabolism and transport using data derived from the planned in vivo and in vitro studies. Our central hypothesis is that vitamin D status independently affects metabolism and transport function in CKD patients. An over-arching goal of this proposal is to make drug therapies safer and more effective to reduce the significant morbidity and mortality in patients with CKD. Three independent Specific Aims comprised of in vivo and in vitro studies were formulated to address the key hypotheses: 1) The in vivo function of individual pathways of xenobiotic metabolism and transport are affected by vitamin D status and by CKD, 2) CKD alters the activity of individual CYPs responsible for vitamin D metabolism, leading to modified pharmacokinetics of cholecalciferol, and 3) Vitamin D treatment and simulated CKD differentially alter the expression and function of drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters in kidney and liver cells. These studies will be central to determine where more scrutiny is warranted in evaluating clinical risks for drug interactions, altered efficacy and toxicity of therapies, and for guidance on appropriate vitamin D deficiency and maintenance regimens. Long term benefits of this research are improvements in medication management, drug dosing guidelines, and corresponding outcomes in targeted organs and/or diseases for vitamin D treated patients. The proposed research would have high impact through the public health benefit of improving care provided to CKD patients, serving as a basis for future study of alterations in drug metabolism and transport, and provision of much needed information on vitamin D metabolism and pharmacokinetics in CKD.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patients with chronic kidney disease have alterations in the way the body handles medications.

The mortality in this group of patients is unacceptably high. A majority of the deaths are due to cardiovascular diseases, followed by infectious complications and protein-energy wasting. Strategies to reduce the mortality of MHD patients, including those directed at traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as statins, have largely been ineffective. Inflammation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and protein-energy wasting. Biomarkers of the inflammatory state such as       C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are elevated in MHD patients and are also robust predictors of cardiovascular events and mortality in this patient population. While anti-inflammatory interventions, especially specific anti-cytokin therapies have been used successfully to treat patients with inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, and while encouraging studies have been reported in improving glycemic control and beta cell function in type 2 diabetes, there are only limited studies using these interventions in MHD patients. Our investigative group has performed a series of studies investigating the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of a number of anti-inflammatory therapies in MHD patients, including Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), Fish Oil (EPA+DHA), Vitamin E (gamma-tocopherol), alpha lipoic acid (ALA) and CoEnyzme Q10 in studies ranging from 14 patients to 300 patients. We have shown that amongst these interventions, IL-1ra and Fish Oil therapies have the most significant beneficial effects on inflammatory markers, such as hsCRP and    IL- 6; whereas Vitamin E and ALA therapies do not influence inflammatory state in these patients. This grant application is submitted in response to the recent NIDDK RFA DK-12-010 (Novel Interventions to Reduce Morbidity and Mortality of Hemodialysis Patients - Safety and Other Early Phase Studies) and has the overarching aim of studying the safety, feasibility and efficacy of promising pharmacological and dialytic interventions in maintenance hemodialysis patients through a U01 collaboration mechanism. Our specific aims are 1) To test the efficacy of IL-1ra and Fish Oil on inflammatory biomarkers over 6 months through two separate randomized clinical trials in maintenance hemodialysis patients; 2) To test the safety and tolerability of IL-1ra and Fish Oil over 6 months through two separate randomized clinical trials in maintenance hemodialysis patients; 3) Create a collaborative network of investigators and dialysis facilities for efficient and swift subject recruitment for pilot and feasibility studies in maintenance hemodialysis patients.

Infrastructure support is needed to accrue an additional 2,700 new cancer cases over the next five years to accomplish the overall goal of conducting innovative research that evaluates how environmental and lifestyle exposures, and genetic susceptibility together affect cancer incidence, mortality and aging-related outcomes. In addition to collecting questionnaire information, these two Asian cohorts include an established biorepository with blood, buccal and urine samples from more than 50,000 participants. With the vigorous follow-up procedures in place, only 1.5 percent of the original cohort participants have been lost to follow-up. To date, approximately 17 percent of the cohort members were diagnosed with incident cancers; approximately 50 percent of the cancer patients have stored biospecimens. Researches evaluating the unique environmental and lifestyle exposures of the Asian cohort study populations have provided novel findings that contributed to the field of cancer etiology and prevention. These novel findings in part provided the rationale for our current chemoprevention trials in U.S. populations. During the next 5-year study period, we propose to: (1) Conduct core infrastructure activities to maintain and enhance the two Asian cohort databases, including: (a) follow-up for cancer, non-cancer and death outcomes, (b) maintenance of the biorepositories, and (c) management of the databases; (2) Conduct in-person and telephone interviews among cohort participants to update exposure and medical information; (3) Collect blood and urine samples from cohort participants with cancer diagnoses; and (4) Engage in collaborative research projects of the NCI and Asian Consortium Consortia. We anticipate that the established resources of the two Asian cohorts will become even more scientifically valuable over the next five years as the younger members of the cohorts enter into the age of maximal cancer incidence, thereby increasing the number of pre-disease biomarker-based research projects.        RELEVANCE: We are requesting infrastructure support for two established, population-based cancer epidemiology cohorts among Chinese men and women. The unique exposures and cancer risl< profiles of the Asian cohorts have been essential to identifying the protective effect of specific dietary factors on cancer risk.

These co-morbidities have been linked to heightened inflammation and monocyte activation, but the etiology of this heightened activation/inflammation is not fully understood, but is partly due to gut epithelial barrier dysfunction and microbial translocation. Attempts at controlling inflammation, immune activation or microbial translocation in HIV+ treated subjects have been for the most part unsuccessful, and even treatment that have been successful (such as statins) have drug interactions and safety concerns, likely precluding their use in a large proportion of the HIV population. Safer strategies that could be more widely adopted are well needed. It has been estimated by the WHO that nearly two billion subjects may be zinc deficient in the developing countries. In the developed countries, prior to effective ART, zinc deficiency was prevalent in HIV-infected subjects, and had been independently linked to disease progression and to higher mortality. Unlike what is observed with most nutrients, the prevalence of zinc deficiency continues to be high, even in subjects on ART. For example, the Nutrition for Healthy Living study found that 38% of subjects on ART had zinc deficiency, and subjects in the upper quartiles of zinc levels had lower HIV-1 RNA levels than those in the lowest quartile. Thus far, there is a lack of data related to the contribution of zinc status to the heightened inflammation and monocyte activation in HIV. Also, the few available zinc-supplementation studies in HIV have been mostly in untreated or not optimally treated subjects, and no studies have assessed changes in inflammation markers after zinc supplementation in HIV+ subjects with virologic suppression on ART, a pertinent population to the current era of HIV infection where guidelines are calling for every HIV+ subject to be aggressively treated. In the R21 phase of the proposal, we will assess the prevalence of zinc deficiency in HIV-infected subjects on ART and compare it to that of a matched group of HIV negative controls. We will also study the relationships between zinc levels and systemic inflammation, innate immunity and gut epithelial barrier dysfunction. Lastly, we will conduct a pilot study testing two different doses of zinc supplementation in HIV-infected subjects on ART with documented zinc deficiency. This pilot trial will also explore whether this strategy may affect selected inflammation markers and will help guide the next phase of investigations. In the R33 phase, we will conduct a pilot randomized placebo-controlled study of zinc supplementation in HIV-infected subjects on ART with zinc deficiency, and we will assess whether zinc supplementation is safe and effective at increasing zinc levels, and whether it will affect different pathways involved in HIV-comorbidities, namely innate immunity, systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and gut epithelial barrier dysfunction. Our proposal should provide important mechanistic insights to inform us on the mechanism of action through which zinc may produce clinical benefit in the HIV+ population, and as such will provide the information necessary to develop a competitive full-scale clinical trial.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Despite the advent of safer HIV therapies, several comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes are more common in people living with HIV, and have been linked to heightened inflammation state. Zinc deficiency (or low zinc levels) has been associated with abnormal state of heightened inflammation and with altered gut barrier in the general population. Little is known about the frequency and consequences of zinc deficiency in people living with HIV despite the fact that this population is known to have high inflammation and abnormal gut barrier. We will measure zinc levels in a group of HIV positive individuals and a group of HIV negative controls, and we will explore whether zinc deficiency is associated with high inflammation and abnormal gut barrier in these groups. In addition, we will conduct a novel pilot trial to study the effect of zinc supplementatio to modulate inflammation and repair abnormal gut barrier. The results of this study should inform public health efforts to ameliorate the risk of comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease not only in HIV-infected subjects, but also in other conditions where inflammation is enhanced, such as rheumatoid arthritis.",

Low bone mineral density (BMD) in childhood increases the risk of early osteoporosis and bone fracture later in life, which has serious individual and societal implications due to the impaired mobility, the associated morbidity and even mortality in older adults. Our long-term goal is to identify vulnerable pediatri populations at risk for bone loss in order to improve their bone health through an early intervention. This study focuses on the prevention of bone loss that occurs in children and adolescents treated with hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for hematologic malignancies. An increase in bone resorption that occurs after HCT in these patients offers an opportunity for intervention with an anti-resorptive agent, yet no prospective studies have been performed that examine the effectiveness of any bisphosphonate or other anti-resorptive agent in pediatric HCT recipients. Therefore, we propose to conduct a prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial of calcium and vitamin D plus pamidronate versus calcium and vitamin D alone to prevent bone loss after pediatric HCT. The central hypothesis is that subjects treated with pamidronate and calcium and vitamin D (Pamidronate Group) will have higher bone mineral content (BMC) and BMD measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and by peripheral quantitative CT, respectively, at 1 year post-HCT than subjects receiving calcium and vitamin D alone (Control Group). The rationale for this study is that treatment with pamidronate at the time of peak bone resorption can prevent/reverse bone loss and have a positive long-term impact on bone health in pediatric HCT recipients. We will pursue three specific aims: 1) To determine the impact of calcium and vitamin D plus pamidronate versus calcium and vitamin D alone on BMC and BMD following HCT in 60 recipients aged 1-18 years at HCT; 2) To characterize the time course of changes in cytokine levels (IL-6, IL-7, TNF-a) associated with the activation of osteoclasts after HCT and their association with BMC and BMD; 3) To examine the sequence of changes in markers of bone turnover after HCT and their response to pamidronate treatment. The current study is innovative in that it is the first to prospectively evaluate the effects of an anti- resortive agent administered shortly after HCT on BMC and BMD in children. This study is expected to have an important positive impact on bone health in children and the field of pediatric endocrinology by providing much needed prospective data on the effectiveness of an anti-resorptive agent after pediatric HCT. The preventive intervention that this project seeks to examine is likely to have an impact on current clinical practice. While biomarkers of bone turnover have been used in adult studies, there is a striking paucity of data on the clinical applicability of these markers in children and adolescents. Evaluating changes in these markers and cytokines after HCT will provide insight into the underlying mechanisms of bone loss.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hematopoietic cell transplantation is being utilized for an increasing number of both malignant and non- malignant disorders and the overall success rates of the procedure continues to improve. Therefore we are now seeing more and more patients who are survivors, but also more who face the long-term consequences of this very intensive form of therapy. Low bone mineral density is increasingly being recognized as a common consequence of bone marrow transplantation. Since childhood and adolescence are critical time periods for establishing peak bone mass for the rest of the adult life, it is importat to intervene early to prevent bone loss and reduce the risk of early osteoporosis and fracture later in life, which can have a significant impact on functional outcomes, ability to work, as well as quality of life.",

Supplementation of vitamin D and/or omega-3 has received attention as a potential anti-aging and cardio-protective strategy. Data from in vitro and animal models suggest that these nutrients are involved in the etiology of aging or behave like a biochemical 'Fountain of Youth' to mediate healthful aging. However, enthusiasm has outpaced the scientific evidence in humans, which is currently based on observational studies and small randomized clinical trials (RCTs) often with small doses. Large clinical trials with a high dose, daily dosing regimen, adequate sample size and trial duration, and longitudinal assessment are urgently needed.  The principal function of telomeres is to protect the genome against chromosomal aberrations. Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is consistently shown to have a direct relationship with longevity, CVD and diabetes in epidemiologic studies, and is thus considered to be a biomarker of aging. What is more, LTL is relatively short in persons with chronic inflammation, which is considered to be part of CVD and diabetic risk. The on-going NIH funded VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) is a large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2 x 2 factorial trial of vitamin D3 (2,000 IU/day) and marine omega-3 fatty acid (ɯ-3 FA, 1 g/day) supplements among a representative sample of US men aged ≥50 years and women aged ≥55 years, with an oversampling of blacks. A unique feature of VITAL is the establishment of a sub-cohort of 1,054 participants who are evaluated in person at the Harvard Clinical and Translational Science Centre (CTSC) in Boston, which allows for in-clinic plasma/buffy coat sample collection and in-depth CVD phenotyping at baseline and Year 2. We propose to examine the effects of dietary vitamin D and/or             omega-3 supplementation on LTL attrition assessed longitudinally utilizing in-clinic buffy coat samples collected at baseline, Year 2, and Year 4. Thus, we will also investigate the effects of vitamin D and/or omega-3 supplementation on the longitudinal interrelationship of LTL trajectory, plasma inflammatory     cytokines, and CVD risk factors in the VITAL trial.  This proposal is in response to the information gaps/research needs identified by the most recent Institute of Medicine (IOM) Report on Dietary Reference Intakes. The IOM report identified the need for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of vitamin D for prevention of CVD, and cellular biology of vitamin D (e.g. cellular aging) as areas of high priority. The American Heart Association and the IOM recommend that all adults eat fish regularly to reduce risk for CVD. This novel and cost-effective study is expected to provide the information necessary to answer the open question of whether dietary vitamin D and/or omega-3 supplementation are beneficial for LTL shortening. Studies of telomeres will also open new avenues for the basic understanding of vitamin D and/or omega-3 as well as their preventive and therapeutic effects of CVD.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Dietary supplementation of vitamin D and/or omega-3 has received attention as a potential anti-aging and cardio-protective strategy; however, enthusiasm has outpaced the scientific evidence in humans, and evidence at the population level remains inconclusive to inform nutritional recommendations. The urgent need has prompted us to propose this present study leveraging the infrastructure of the ongoing national trial called VITAL to examine the balance of their benefits and risks. Data obtained would serve to shape evidence-based dietary vitamin D/omega intake recommendations and guidelines in elderly people.",

UUI symptoms overlap with symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI), the most common infection in older adults and UUI is associated with an increased risk of UTI in both men and women. Overall success with current UUI treatment modalities remains poor and short-term. Vitamin D supplementation is a plausible intervention for UUI and UTI prevention, but few studies have examined associations between vitamin D levels and UUI and UTI. Vitamin D may influence detrusor muscle contraction by activating vitamin D receptors present in detrusor muscle and blocking the RhoA/Rho-associated kinase, a calcium-independent pathway for smooth muscle contraction. Vitamin D also stimulates production of antimicrobial peptides, which inhibit growth of bladder bacteria that may confer risk for or protection from UUI and UTI. It is now known that urine is not sterile, and that standard urine cultures fail to detect most urinary bacteria (microbiome) regardless of the amount. Present in men and women, the urinary microbiome likely influences bladder health. This study will examine the associations between vitamin D levels, the urinary microbiome, and UUI and UTI risk in both men and women across four racial/ethnic groups. To achieve this goal, the Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) will use the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a large racially diverse cohort of adults followed longitudinally to determine the characteristics of subclinical cardiovascular disease and its progression. At the upcoming 15-year follow-up exam, the mean age of MESA participants will be 70-75 years; in this age group, UUI prevalence exceeds 30% in women and 15% in men. We propose to investigate the association of both current UUI status and future UTI with vitamin D and the urinary microbiome and create prediction models that incorporate both traditional (e.g. obesity, diabetes) and novel (vitamin D and urinary microbiome) risk factors for the identification of individuals at high risk or UUI and UTI.

In this application, we propose to examine the role of the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin, and its primary regulator vitamin D, in lung function impairment, respiratory infections and acute exacerbations of COPD as well as evaluate the effect of oral vitamin D supplementation on lung cathelicidin levels in humans. Cathelicidin has bactericidal and inflammatory activities in the lung and is regulated by vitamin D levels. Our hypothesis is that reduced cathelicidin levels are associated with accelerated lung function decline though a pathway partially mediated by increased infections and COPD exacerbations. We hypothesize the effect of cathelicidin on lung function is greater in those with vitamin D insufficiency and that oral vitamin D supplementation will raise cathelicidin levels in the pulmonary compartment, thereby restoring lung cathelicidin deficiency. Specifically, through longitudinal investigation nested within an ongoing cohort study of urban, predominantly African-American individuals at high risk for development of OLDs, we will characterize the rate of lung function decline in 380 participants followed with serial spirometry measures for up to six years. Baseline and repeated measures of cathelicidin and vitamin D will be examined as independent predictors of lung function decline and respiratory infections. Separately, using longitudinal data from 2100 participants enrolled in the Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study (SPIROMICS) study with established COPD, baseline measures of blood cathelicidin and vitamin D will be examined as an independent predictor of longitudinal FEV1 decline and COPD exacerbations over three years. In both cohorts, concurrent vitamin D measurements will permit evaluation of antecedent and modifier on the cathelicidin-lung outcomes relationships. Finally, we will measure blood and lung lavage cathelicidin levels in 40 vitamin D insufficient individuals before and after eight weeks of oral vitamin D supplementation to determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on cathelicidin levels. Completion of these aims will provide a robust determination of the role of cathelicidin in lung function decline and adverse pulmonary outcomes in unique populations of at-risk and diseased individuals. Moreover, the aims of this application directly or indirectly wor towards ultimately understanding if a readily measurable blood marker, cathelicidin, can inform who may benefit from vitamin D supplementation to prevent chronic lung disease. The results from this application would lead to a therapeutic intervention study that will provide further opportunities to improve our understanding of the relationship between vitamin D, cathelicidin and lung function.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal will evaluate a potential mechanism of increased risk of lung function impairment, as well as determine if vitamin D replacement can alter this pathway.

As aGvHD is responsible for nearly 20% of deaths following alloHCT, the need for better prevention and therapy for aGvHD is readily apparent. Involvement of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract in the pathogenesis of aGvHD has been substantiated by the translation of pre-clinical and clinical studies. Emerging evidence suggests that perturbations in the microbiota diversity result in aberrant systemic immune response as well as pathogen colonization and mucosal invasion, fostering the development of GvHD. Pre-clinical studies also suggest that replenishing commensals like Lactobacillus prior to HCT substantially decrease GvHD severity and intestinal insult. Our pilot data suggest that probiotics are safe to administer prior to and during children and adolescents undergoing HCT (IND#108,977). This proposal is a double-blind, randomized, multi-center intervention trial to evaluate the specific effect of probiotics in preventing GI aGvHD and more generally the effects on overall GvHD severity. The proposal is an approved concept of Children’s Oncology Group’s (COG), a NCI National Clinical Trial Network group. The study will be conducted through COG using its clinical research infrastructure. Correlative laboratory studies (plasma and stool analysis) will be performed in order to elucidate the mechanisms of action of probiotic therapy. The probiotic, Lactobacillus plantarum (LBP), or placebo will be administered to 384 evaluable children and adolescents undergoing alloHCT for hematologic malignancy beginning with the initiation of conditioning through Day 56. We hypothesize that maintaining epithelial cell integrity through the administration of probiotic therapy will lead to restoring microbial diversity, which will preserve immune tolerance and prevent aGvHD. The primary study aim is to determine efficacy of orally-administered LBP in preventing the development of GI aGvHD in children and adolescents undergoing alloHCT for the treatment of cancer. Secondary study aims are: (1) To determine whether orally-administered LBP decreases the incidence of Grade II–IV aGvHD following alloHCT; (2) To determine whether LBP administration maintains intestinal integrity as measured by mean plasma citrulline levels and reduction in mucosal barrier injury (MBI) bacteremia; (3a) To measure the effects of LBP on the intestinal flora phylogenetic composition during and after alloHCT using 16S rRNA gene deep sequencing; (3b) To measure effects of LBP on intestinal flora function during and after alloHCT using metagenomic and metabolite profiling; and (4) To measure proposed immunomodulatory effects of LBP in mean plasma levels of alloreactive-induced inflammatory cytokines (IL-2, IL-6, IL-12p70, IFNγ, and TNFα) in patients receiving LBP compared to placebo. The proposed study will be the first double-blind randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of probiotics in preventing GI aGvHD in pediatric HCT. If a beneficial effect is observed, expansion of the proposed intervention to other pediatric and adult malignant conditions requiring alloHCT may improve overall quality of life and prevent transplant-related complications like aGvHD.","Project Narrative The proposed study is a randomized, controlled intervention trial to determine the benefit of probiotic therapy in preventing the development of gastrointestinal acute graft versus host disease in children undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation for a hematologic malignancy. Importantly, correlative studies will be performed to elucidate mechanisms of probiotic therapy on the microbiome. The discovery of a benefit of probiotic therapy will have a significant impact on morbidity, mortality, and cost of care in both adults and children undergoing HCT for treatment of cancer.",

Heavy alcohol use and HIV infection are both causes of microbial translocation, the process by which bacterial products from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract leak across the GI membrane to the portal circulation. Microbial translocation causes immune activation leading to end organ damage. Alcohol can cause microbial translocation via zinc deficiency. Zinc deficiency is common among HIV+ heavy drinkers and linked to high mortality rates. Zinc supplementation is affordable, available, does not interfere with ART, and has minimal adverse drug reactions. In animal models zinc reduces ethanol associated microbial translocation. In human studies zinc slows HIV disease progression and reduces levels of inflammatory biomarkers which are strongly linked to mortality. Given zinc's potential efficacy we propose to conduct Zinc for INflammation and Chronic disease in HIV (ZINC HIV), a double-blinded randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of zinc supplementation vs. placebo among 250 HIV+ Russians, who are ART-naive at enrollment and have a recent history of heavy drinking. We will recruit most of our participants from the Russia cohort within the Uganda Russia Boston Alcohol Network for Alcohol Research Collaboration on HIV/AIDS (URBAN ARCH) Consortium study. Our specific aims will test the efficacy of zinc supplementation, compared to placebo to (1) improve markers of mortality as measured by the VACS index; (2) slow HIV disease progression as measured by CD4 cell count; (3) improve markers of AMI risk as measured by the Reynolds risk score; and (4) lower levels of microbial translocation and inflammation as measured by serum biomarkers. We hypothesize that as compared with placebo, patients receiving zinc supplementation will have significantly lower AMI and mortality risk as measured by the VACS index and Reynolds risk scores; higher CD4 cell counts; lower levels of biomarkers for microbial translocation and inflammation. Importantly, if our hypotheses are true, zinc supplementation could ultimately become a standard adjunctive therapy complementing alcohol interventions among HIV+ persons even in resource limited environments.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The combination of heavy alcohol consumption and HIV infection results in serious health problems and an increased risk of death. Although it is not exactly clear how alcohol and HIV do this, inflammation appears to play an important role. Zinc supplementation has anti-inflammatory properties. This study is designed to see if giving zinc supplementation to HIV infected people who are heavy drinkers reduces the risk of serious health problems and death.",

The first two funding cycles were dedicated to elucidating the  fundamental mechanisms that induce the ‘alcoholic lung phenotype’. Our experimental findings have  elucidated central roles for oxidative stress (including profound glutathione depletion), zinc  deficiency, and decreased expression and function of PPAR in mediating the effects of alcohol.  More recently we identified that alcohol inhibits the actions of Nrf2, the transcription factor  that activates the anti-oxidant response element (ARE) and programmatically induces the expression  of hundreds of genes (including those involved in glutathione homeostasis) required to defend  against inflammatory stresses. Moreover, Nrf2 and PPAR activity appear to be zinc-dependent and  therefore these pathways may be interdependent and therefore coordinately targeted by alcohol.  Remarkably, these same pathways are targeted during chronic HIV infection, and we have determined  that alcohol and HIV- related proteins have additive toxicities on lung epithelial and macrophage  function. As our Center   investigators are also engaged in translational clinical trials in  HIV-mediated lung disease, we have the unique capacity to study the combined effects of alcohol and  HIV and how this combination may pose a challenge to developing effective therapies. These  discoveries have not only revealed the mechanisms by which alcohol renders the lung susceptible to  injury but have also identified candidate therapies targets that Center investigators are testing  in experimental models and clinical trials.

Recent findings from the Physicians’ Health Study II, the only large-scale clinical trial of a daily multivitamin, indicated a significant reduction in cataract, but an elevated, though statistically non-significant, increased risk of AMD. These findings in men require confirmation in other men and extension to women. The proposed study will utilize resources and data from the COcoa-Supplement and Multivitamins Outcomes Study (COSMOS), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2x2 factorial trial testing a patented, high-quality cocoa extract supplement (Mars Symbioscience) and Centrum Silver multivitamin (Pfizer) in the prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer among 12,000 women aged ≥65 years and 6,000 men aged ≥60 years with 4 years of treatment and follow-up. Woman participants will be drawn from the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) cohort, and male participants will be drawn from a target population screened for participation (but not randomized) in the VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL). Beginning in June, 2015 and continuing through 2016, willing and eligible respondents to an invitational mailing will be enrolled in a 3-month run-in. Those who demonstrate good compliance with pill taking during the run-in, and remain willing and eligible, will be randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups for 5 years. At 1-year intervals, participants will receive a new supply of pills and a follow-up questionnaire on compliance, possible side effects, and incidence of endpoints. We propose to document incident cataract and prevalent and incident AMD endpoints in the COSMOS cohort in order to evaluate the efficacy of multivitamin and cocoa extract supplements in cataract and AMD prevention. The primary aims of the proposed study are to test whether 1) a daily multivitamin will reduce the risk of cataract; 2) a daily multivitamin will reduce the risk of total AMD events, a composite of incident AMD plus cases of progression to advanced AMD (neovascular AMD plus central geographic atrophy) among participants with prevalent AMD at baseline. The effect of cocoa extract supplements (capsule containing 750 mg/d flavanols, including 75 mg (-)-epicatechin, and 90 mg theobromine) in reducing risks of AMD and cataract will be examined as secondary aims. This research is responsive to a program priority of the National Eye Institute’s Strategic Plan to improve diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of eye disease. We believe the proposed eye disease ancillary to COSMOS offers a unique opportunity to obtain a reliable, efficient, and informative evaluation of the efficacy of two extremely promising preventive agents for cataract and AMD at a fraction of the cost of separate trials.","PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite the wide-spread usage of multivitamin supplements, and the growing enthusiasm for cocoa supplements, definitive data on the balance of risks and benefits of these agents are lacking. Data from this large-scale randomized trial should clarify the role of multivitamin and cocoa supplements in the prevention of cataract and AMD, two leading causes of visual impairment in US men and women.",

Critical illness survivors suffer significant long-term morbidity and mortality. Biologic daa suggests a relationship between vitamin D and important outcomes in critically ill patients. The recently published VITdAL-ICU trial a randomized controlled trial demonstrates that high dose vitamin D supplementation in critically ill patients with severe vitamin D deficiency appears to improve mortality. How vitamin D supplementation impacts critical care outcomes and which patients may benefit from vitamin D supplementation is not clear. We propose to examine the mechanism of protection of vitamin D and identify biologically plausible biomarkers through examination of the pharmacokinetics of high dose vitamin D supplementation and the modification of circulating metabolites with vitamin D supplementation using human blood samples from the completed VITdAL-ICU trial. Morbidity and mortality related to critical illness remain unacceptably high and novel therapeutic approaches to improve outcomes are urgently needed. Vitamin D is an inexpensive and innovative therapy that has significant potential to improve outcomes in critically ill patients with vitamin D deficiency.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) are at very high risk for mortality. Mortality in the hospital is 12% for patients who receive ICU care and mortality approaches 30% for those with sepsis. Few therapeutic options other than antibiotics and supportive care have been shown to improve outcomes in the ICU. Recently in the VITdAL-ICU trial, vitamin D supplementation was shown to improve mortality in critically ill patients when given to those with severe vitamin D deficiency. An effective therapeutic agent such as vitamin D, which may be able to alter one of the key pathways leading to uncontrolled inflammation, has significant potential to improve outcomes for critically ill patients. We propose to examine blood samples from the VITdAL-ICU trial to determine if inflammation and metabolism pathways improve with vitamin D and identify blood markers of patients likely to benefit from vitamin D.",

Most asthma is diagnosed before the age of six. Thus, prenatal and early life exposures play an important role in the development of asthma and allergies. On the basis of finding an inverse association between family size and atopy, it was postulated that reduced microbial exposure in early life explains the epidemic of allergic diseases (the “hygiene hypothesis”). The original hygiene hypothesis has undergone changes and refinement, and is now taken to mean not just simply a reduced microbial exposure, but perhaps changes in the breadth and types of microorganisms coupled with changing environments. The gut flora is, quantitatively, the most important postnatal source of microbial stimulation of the immune system. Significant differences between the gut flora of children in industrialized and developing nations suggest that the high prevalence of asthma in affluent nations may be due to changes in the intestinal flora of young infants. This concept of “dysbiotic drift,” whereby environmental forces related to Westernized lifestyles leads to a shift of the developing microbiota away from the norm, may explain why many chronic inflammatory conditions, such as asthma, are associated with Westernized lifestyles. Dysbiosis is a potential mechanism by which the environment interacts with the early developing immune system to program risk for chronic disease. While there are a growing number of studies that are investigating the role of the intestinal microbiome in asthma, these have examined stool samples obtained at one point in time. Since the intestinal microbiome undergoes rapid changes before it becomes established between the ages of 1 and 3 years of life, longitudinal studies are needed. Additionally, no studies have accounted for the host genetic background, which may determine both the development of dysbiosis and who develops asthma when faced with dysbiosis. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that vitamin D deficiency in the pre-, peri-, and immediate post-natal periods, in addition to host genetic influences, lead to intestinal dysbiosis in early life. Dysbiosis, in the proper host genetic context, then increases the risk for development of asthma. While we have collected information on a host of other relevant exposures, this proposal will focus on vitamin D as the primary exposure of interest. We have put together 2 vitamin D clinical trial populations – Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART) and Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood (COPSAC2010) – with prospective collection of exposures during pregnancy and early life, that we will leverage to test our hypotheses. This proposal is in response to FOA RFA-OD-16-004, Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) Pediatric Cohorts (UG3/UH3). In these cohorts, we will first determine the patterns of change in the early intestinal microbiome (both composition and metabolic function) up to age 6 years that are related with vitamin D deficiency in the prenatal and perinatal periods. We will also investigate genetic markers of the host that affect these patterns in the intestinal microbiome. We will then investigate the relationship of these patterns of change in the microbiome with the presence of asthma by age 6 years. Findings from this project will point to potential mechanisms by which early environmental exposures interact with the developing intestinal microbiome and the host to confer risk for asthma.","PROJECT NARRATIVE Asthma and allergies are the most common chronic disorders in children. There is a lack of understanding of the risk factors and mechanisms that lead to asthma and allergies. We will investigate the role of two novel risk factors – vitamin D and the intestinal microbiome – on the risk of asthma and allergies in the child, and findings from this important and efficient study could form the basis for development of new and important approaches to reduction of these conditions.",

Maternal smoking during pregnancy adversely affects lung development as seen by lifelong decreases in pulmonary function and increased risk of asthma. In a randomized controlled trial (RCT), published in JAMA, we have provided evidence that maternal vitamin C supplementation (500 mg daily during pregnancy) can decrease the effects of maternal smoking during pregnancy on offspring lung function and the subsequent incidence of wheeze. The purpose of this ECHO application is to combine the offspring from the prenatal cohorts of two RCTs studying the effects of vitamin C supplementation to pregnant smokers on offspring respiratory outcomes and to determine if the innovative therapy of maternal vitamin C supplementation during pregnancy leads to prolonged improvements on offspring’s pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and respiratory health. To begin to understand mechanisms by which prenatal vitamin C may be preventing changes in the health of offspring of smokers, we examined gene specific DNA methylation from a subset of placentas, cord bloods and buccal swabs (ages 2-5) collected from subjects who were the offspring of prospectively-followed pregnant placebo- treated smokers, vitamin C-treated smokers, or non-smokers. In parallel with the effects of vitamin C on the reduction of the effects of maternal smoking on offspring PFTs and wheeze, the supplementary vitamin C prevented the majority of significant changes in DNA methylation induced by maternal smoking in both placentas and cord blood. Strikingly, this prevention of alterations in DNA methylation was still evident 2-5 years later in offspring buccal swabs. This preliminary data suggests that the mechanism underlying vitamin C’s prevention of some of the effects of maternal smoking on offspring pulmonary health involves the prevention of epigenetic changes induced by maternal smoking. Thus this application has 4 specific aims: 1, to create the combined cohort of offspring from the 2 RCTs of vitamin C supplementation to pregnant smokers; 2, to determine if the protective effects of maternal vitamin C supplementation to pregnant smokers on offspring pulmonary health extend to early adolescence; 3, to begin to characterize the epigenetic mechanisms that appear to underlie the effects of smoking during pregnancy on offspring lung health and on the protective effects of vitamin C; and 4, to gather core data for and interact with the overall ECHO study. Respiratory health will be assessed by longitudinal semi-annual, validated respiratory histories and yearly PFTs beginning at 3 years of age. Buccal swabs will be collected yearly and blood at 6, 9 and 12 years to provide DNA for genetic analysis. DNA methylation changes will be measured by methylation chips and bisulfite sequencing. This study will address how smoking during pregnancy affects respiratory outcomes, provide mechanistic and therapeutic insights, and provide subjects and data to ECHO to address other key outcomes.","Narrative Maternal smoking during pregnancy is the largest preventable cause of childhood respiratory illness, and children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy show lifetime decreases in pulmonary function and increased respiratory illnesses and asthma. Sadly, more than 50% of smokers who become pregnant continue to smoke and approximately 20% of expenditures for childhood respiratory illness are caused by maternal smoking amounting to over $1 billion annually in current health care dollars. The purpose of this ECHO application is to combine two prenatal cohorts to study the effects of maternal smoking during pregnancy on respiratory outcomes, determine if the innovative therapy of maternal vitamin C supplementation during pregnancy leads to prolonged improvements on offspring’s pulmonary function tests and respiratory health, and to interact with the greater ECHO cohort to promote childhood health and well-being.",

Surprisingly to cardiologists, the chelation strategy,  combination of up to 40 infusions with intravenous disodium EDTA plus oral multivitamins and multiminerals (OMVM) compared with intravenous and oral placebo, led to a significant reduction in the time to first recurrent cardiovascular event in patients with prior myocardial infarction (MI), age 50 or older, already treated with standard evidence based medical therapies (HR 0.74; 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.57- 0.95; p=0.016. The 5-year number needed to treat (NNT) was 12. In the prespecified subgroup with diabetes (n=633), the results were dramatic: the chelation-based strategy reduced the composite primary clinical endpoint by 51% (HR 0.49, 95%CI (0.33 0.75); p<0.001, 5-year NNT 5.5) and reduced total mortality by 43% (p=0.011, 5-year NNT 12). As a result of these findings, and because of the public health impact of cardiovascular disease and of diabetes, we have been encouraged by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the FDA to confirm the results of TACT1. The three Specific Aims of TACT2 are: 1) To determine if the chelation-based strategy in patients with diabetes and prior MI improves event-free survival; 2) To determine if the chelation-based strategy in patients with diabetes and prior MI reduces mortality; 3) To perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of the TACT2 chelation strategy. TACT2 will enroll 1200 diabetic patients 50 years of age or older with a prior MI and a serum creatinine of 2.0 mg/dL or less. Patients will be randomly allocated (1:1) to receive either chelation + OMVM or double placebo and followed for clinical events until the end of the 5 year trial. The primary endpoint will be a composite of all-cause mortality, recurrent MI, stroke, coronary revascularization, and hospitalization for unstable angina. A Clinical Events Committee masked to treatment assignment will adjudicate events. Principal secondary endpoints will include: (1) all-cause mortality; (2) a composite of cardiovascular mortality, recurrent MI, or stroke; and (3) safety.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of the Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy 2 (TACT2) is to perform a pragmatic and efficient replication of TACT1 in patients with diabetes and a prior heart attack. The results of TACT2 will determine whether disodium ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (Na2EDTA) chelation therapy receives approval from the US Food and Drug Administration and is subsequently accepted to reduce the risk of major adverse events from coronary artery disease in patients with diabetes.

Roughly 0.5% of preeclampsia is early onset and occurs at < 34 weeks gestation, thus annually affecting up to 20,000 U.S. women and infants. There is no treatment other than delivery. Expectant management of early onset preeclampsia (EOP) to gain in-utero time for the fetus has been reported; however half of the cases of preterm birth in women with EOP occur due to maternal complications such as development of severe hypertension or other end organ damage. It is believed that preeclampsia originates with shallow trophoblast invasion. This results in activation of the vascular endothelium with subsequent upregulation of soluble fms-tyrosine kinase (sFlt-1); stimulation of endothelin (ET)-1; and activation of ADPR-cyclase leading to potent vasocontriction. Nicotinamide is a water-soluble vitamin that inhibits ADPR-cyclase and thus acts to reduce the downstream effects of sFlt-1 upregulation. Using mouse models of preeclampsia characterized by ET-1 upregulation or abnormal placentation we show that nicotinamide reduces hypertension and proteinuria and increases maternal and fetal survival. Our phase I study of low-dose oral nicotinamide in 10 women with EOP demonstrates safety and tolerability. Building on our preclinical and phase I study findings, the objectives of this proposal are to test the effect of higher dose nicotinamide supplementation in women with EOP on maternal mean arterial pressure (MAP) and further evaluate its safety. Demonstration of beneficial effects of nicotinamide dietary supplementation on maternal BP will be the first evidence to date to support medical treatment of EOP to attempt to delay delivery. Successful completion of this proposal will guide the development of a future clinical study of this low cost, nontoxic dietary supplement for prolonging gestation in EOP. !","Public Health Relevance Statement Nicotinamide (vitamin B3-amide) is a nontoxic water-soluble amide of vitamin B3 that lowers blood pressure and mortality in a mouse model of preeclampsia, probably via its inhibitory action on ADPR-cyclase. We will test the ability of nicotinamide to lower maternal blood pressure and reduce risk of development of severe hypertension in women with early-onset preeclampsia. Such effects would demonstrate feasibility of studying nicotinamide as a therapeutic in EOP to prolong gestation and reduce medically indicated preterm birth.",

HTE is an assessment of the degree to which the impact of an intervention varies between subgroups. Evidence from trials of selenium supplementation indicates that this is a critical area for investigation of HTE. To date, three major clinical trials of the trace element selenium (Se) as a chemopreventive agent have been completed. First, in the Nutritional Prevention of Cancer (NPC) trial, participants were supplemented with 200 µg of Se per day or matching placebo, and a statistically significant 58% reduction in colorectal cancer incidence among participants randomized to receive the selenium supplement was observed. Next, the results of the Selenium and Vitamin E Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) were published. The largest trial to date of Se for cancer prevention, SELECT demonstrated no reduction in risk of colorectal cancer among men supplemented with 200 µg/d of Se as L-selenomethionine. We have recently completed the Selenium Trial, which was the third major clinical trial of Se for chemoprevention. This was a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in which 1535 participants received 200 µg/d of Se as selenized yeast or placebo to ascertain whether Se supplementation reduced the risk of colorectal adenoma recurrence. No differences in overall colorectal adenoma recurrence by intervention group were detected; however, subgroup analyses revealed the presence of heterogeneity of treatment effect (HTE). Among participants who had an advanced adenoma at baseline, there was a statistically significant reduction in adenoma recurrence for those randomized to Se as compared to placebo. However, there was also a statistically significant increase in the incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) among older participants (>63 years) receiving selenium. These results identify a major research gap regarding the need for identification of individual characteristics that may contribute to HTE and thus determine whether Se supplementation elicits a beneficial or harmful effect. This is a particularly timely question given that approximately half of American adults report using dietary supplements. We propose herein to investigate several factors that may affect individual outcomes related to Se supplementation, including 1) Genetic background; 2) Intake and blood concentrations of fat-soluble antioxidants; and 3) Oxylipin profiles in response to Se supplementation. In summary, we contend that the in vivo efficacy and toxicity of Se in a given individual may be influenced by genetic background, interactions with antioxidants, and oxylipin metabolomic profiles. The findings of this study will have a direct impact on public health recommendations by identifying individual characteristics that may elicit either beneficial or harmful health effects of Se supplementation.","PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed work has the potential to make major contributions to public health recommendations regarding the potential benefits and harms of selenium supplements. We have designed three separate but complementary aims that will elucidate factors that elicit individual differential responses to selenium supplementation using genetic analysis, consideration of fat-soluble antioxidant interactions, and targeted oxylipin profiling.",

Dr. Bethea’s long-term goal is to carry out studies that will result in a better understanding of factors that influence cancer survivorship and that will lead, ultimately, to higher survival among Black women affected by breast cancer and reduced cancer health disparities. She has already had training in environmental health and cancer epidemiology. Through the K01 training, she will develop expertise in cancer survivorship, statistical analyses of survival data, and molecular epidemiology, under the mentorship of a distinguished panel of researchers – Drs. Julie Palmer, Christine Ambrosone, Nancy Keating, Michael LaValley, and Edward Ruiz-Narváez. The mortality rate from breast cancer, the most commonly occurring cancer among women in the U.S., is 42% higher in Black women than White women. Dr. Bethea’s research will address an understudied topic, modifiable factors related to breast cancer survivorship in Black women. To this end, her proposed research utilizes data from the Black Women’s Health Study (BWHS), a longitudinal study of 59,000 African American women. During follow-up, more than 2,300 incident invasive breast cancer cases have occurred and they will be the subject of Dr. Bethea’s research. Dr. Bethea will assess several modifiable risk factors – post-diagnosis use of aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and post- diagnosis use of vitamin D supplements and of predicted plasma vitamin D levels – in relation to breast cancer recurrence and breast cancer-specific mortality among breast cancer cases in the BWHS. She will create genetic risk scores using data on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from candidate genes and will assess whether the associations of aspirin/other NSAIDs or of vitamin D supplementation and predicted plasma vitamin D levels with breast cancer recurrence and breast cancer-specific mortality are modified by genetic risk scores. Thus, Dr. Bethea will create a specific area of research in which she is highly proficient. As an independent researcher, it is anticipated that she will lead further BWHS research on cancer survivorship, which could be stand-alone studies or collaborative studies with other investigators. Dr. Bethea is an outstanding candidate. A K01 career development award will enable her to conduct important research as an independent investigator and put her on the path to obtaining NIH R01 and similar grant support and on a path to promotion. Importantly, it will also provide valuable information on factors related to breast cancer survival in Black women.","PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposal will support didactic training and mentored research in cancer survival and molecular epidemiology for Dr. Traci Bethea.

Published evidence links MCI to elevated oxidative stress caused by increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). To defend against the damaging potential of ROS (which causes oxidative stress, OxS), cells normally depend on antioxidants, and Glutathione (GSH) is the main component of human endogenous intracellular antioxidant defenses. GSH is a tripeptide composed of three amino-acids, cysteine, glycine and glutamic acid. Since elderly humans are known to have an increased risk of developing elevated OxS and GSH deficiency, we investigated and reported that intracellular GSH deficiency in elderly humans occurs primarily due to intracellular deficiency of two of its precursor amino-acids cysteine and glycine, but not glutamic acid, and that these GSH-deficient elderly humans had elevated ROS levels indicating elevated OxS. Supplementing cysteine (as n-acetylcysteine) plus glycine orally as capsules for 2-weeks replenished their own intracellular concentrations, improved intracellular GSH synthesis, restored intracellular GSH levels and lowered ROS/OxS to levels seen in younger humans. GSH is also a key component of mitochondrial antioxidant defenses, and GSH depletion induces mitochondrial dysfunction with elevated ROS levels, neuronal injury and apoptosis. We studied and reported that mitochondrial dysfunction and OxS in aging (elderly humans and aged mice) can be improved by correcting GSH deficiency. These findings have implications for MCI in elderly humans. In a small ongoing open-label pilot study investigating the long-term safety and impact of supplementing cysteine and glycine on mitochondrial function, OxS and cognitive function (NCT02348762), we found significant improvements in memory, language and executive function at 4w, 12w and 24w after starting cysteine plus glycine supplementation, and these benefits appear to recede 12w after stopping these supplements. These preliminary data support the exciting possibility that cysteine plus glycine supplementation in elderly humans could improve MCI by improving GSH concentrations, mitochondrial function, and/or improving vascular/endothelial function, and by lowering OxS. The goals of this pilot trial are to (a) establish the relationship in older humans between MCI, GSH deficiency, impaired mitochondrial fuel oxidation and elevated OxS, and (b) determine proof-of- concept of whether supplementing cysteine plus glycine to correct these defects improves MCI in aging.","Elderly humans have an increased risk of dementia which begins as mild defects in memory called mild cognitive impairment – we do not know why this happens and there is no effective treatment. Our group found that supplementing the diets of such elderly humans with protein building blocks called cysteine and glycine improves their cognitive function, and when these supplements are stopped the benefits begin to decline. This exploratory study will find out if this effect is real and identify factors responsible for cognitive impairment (and improvement) by studying a bigger group of elderly humans with mild cognitive impairment who will be evaluated 12 weeks after receiving either cysteine plus glycine or a placebo protein, and a further 12-weeks after stopping these supplement proteins.",

The proline dehydrogenase gene (PRODH) is located in the common deleted region, and encodes the enzyme that catalyzes proline catabolism. Proline is a neuromodulator at glutamatergic synapses, and the peripheral hyperprolinemia arising from PRODH mutations or CNVs encompassing PRODH, has been associated with cognitive impairment and decreased IQ. We recently reported a highly significant association of hyperprolinemia with SZ. We now provide evidence that two further independent SZ risk factors: Low vitamin-D status, and mutation of the dysbindin gene (Dtnbp1), also cause hyperprolinemia. Our findings suggest convergence of the biological pathways regulated by vitamin-D and DTNBP1, via loss of PRODH expression, with elevated proline as a common SZ endophenotype. Studies have documented the dysfunctional consequences of hyperprolinemia, such as aberrant glutamatergic and dopamine signaling leading to, for example, cognitive deficits and attenuated prepulse inhibition (PPI). Targeting hyperprolinemia in the Dtnbp1 model may therefore positively impact neurotransmitter signaling and restore function. This proposed study is designed to test our hypotheses under the following Specific Aims. Aim 1: To test the relative molecular contributions of low Vitamin D, and PRODH, and DTNBP1 gene variants, to SZ- associated hyperprolinemia. In a SZ patient and control sample (n=250), we will measure plasma proline and Vitamin-D levels, confirming the strong relationship between elevated proline and low Vitamin-D. From our preliminary data, we anticipate that 80% of the measured hyperprolinemia will arise from low vitamin-D, while DTNBP1 and PRODH variants will be responsible for the remaining 20%. Thus, we will perform molecular analyses on our complete study cohort (404 subjects), screening for PRODH, and DTNBP1 variants that alter gene expression, and testing for variant associations, plus interactions with low Vitamin-D, on the outcome of proline elevation. Aim 2: To examine the molecular pathway leading to hyperprolinemia in the Dtnbp1 model. Aim 2A. Molecular analyses will include assay of peripheral and CNS tissue expression of Prodh, p53 regulated genes, and Comt (downstream of Prodh), as well as of cortical, hippocampal and peripheral proline levels. Aim 2B. Utilizing primary neurons and astrocytes from sdy-/- and Prodh+/- mice, we will directly upregulate Prodh expression, via treatment with Vitamin D and the thiazolidinedione drug Rosiglitazone (RZG), testing for restoration of Prodh expression and decreased cellular proline. Aim 3: To target hyperprolinemia in the Dtnbp1 model in vivo. We will examine whether treatment with Vitamin D (Aim 3a), RZG (Aim 3b), and, to seek to reduce the impact of off-target effects, a proline-deficient diet (Aim 3c), compared to vehicle- treatment alone, restores the above pathway in vivo, and prevents or alleviates the Sdy-/- deficit in, for example, PPI and spatial working memory.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An enzyme called 'PRODH', which is encoded by the PRODH gene, normally breaks down the amino acid proline, and we recently found that a large proportion (26%) of people with schizophrenia have 'hyperprolinemia', which is high fasting levels of proline in the blood (and there is evidence that high proline has highly toxic effects in the brain). We have now discovered that two further schizophrenia risk factors- low vitamin-D and mutation of the gene 'DTNBP1', also cause hyperprolinemia, and under this proposed study we will measure the contributions of these risk factors to the development of hyperprolinemia in schizophrenia patients and in a mouse model system that also exhibits hyperprolinemia. We will then test if treatments that turn on the PRODH gene lead to a reduction in proline and rescue the behavioral and learning deficits seen in this mouse model, which if successful would provide compelling evidence for testing whether these treatments also reduce schizophrenia symptoms in this large patient group, and thus has very important public health implications.",

Lower intensity and better-tolerated, cost-effective treatment strategies are needed for these patients. Low vitamin D levels at diagnosis of indolent lymphomas are strongly associated with inferior outcomes to treatment. Standard therapy for low tumor burden, indolent lymphoma includes a single agent monoclonal antibody (rituximab). In this proposal, we will complete a double-blind, placebo- controlled randomized trial evaluating if vitamin D supplementation with 2000IU oral tablets daily for three years improves the progression-free survival of patients with indolent lymphoma treated with single agent rituximab. Stratification factors for randomization will include histology and FL-IPI prognostic score. The primary endpoint of the trial is progression-free survival over three years; secondary endpoints include response at 13 weeks, and overall survival. Planned subset analyses include follicular lymphoma histology and female sex. With 210 randomized patients, we will have 80% power to detect a HR = 0.55 at a two sided alpha = 0.05 level of significance. This clinical trial will be coordinated at the University of Rochester Wilmot Cancer Institute, and six expert lymphoma centers from the Lymphoma Epidemiology of Outcomes (LEO) Consortium will participate. We will leverage this LEO consortium for tumor banking and prospective patient-reported outcomes of enrolled patients. We will also identify if baseline and/or restaging serum vitamin D levels predict subgroups of patients for whom Vitamin D supplementation is particularly effective or particularly ineffective. Finally, since there is evidence to suggest that response to oral vitamin D supplementation may be dependent upon specific genotypes of the Vitamin D receptor (VDR) and vitamin D binding protein (DPB), we will utilize whole exome sequencing to determine whether vitamin D-related germline variations are critical determinants of outcome in the context of vitamin D supplementation of patients with indolent lymphoma. Our aims the defining threshold levels of vitamin D where supplementation is most effective and the impact of germline polymorphisms on outcome will inform future trial designs and contribute to mechanistic understanding. Demonstrating a benefit to vitamin D supplementation in this randomized trial would rapidly change standard of care in the most common presentation of indolent lymphoma, and provide a low-risk, well-tolerated, inexpensive option delaying the time to morbid treatments.","PROJECT NARRATIVE Several studies suggest Vitamin D deficiency is correlated with inferior outcome after treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In this proposal, we will conduct a randomized clinical trial (ILyAD: Indolent lymphoma and vitamin D) comparing standard rituximab therapy with vitamin D supplementation to standard rituximab therapy and placebo in patients with low tumor burden indolent lymphoma.

Even though it is well known that insulin resistance and chronic inflammation lead to HTN and accelerate vascular disease in patients with T2DM, very little is known about the mechanisms by which these risk factors promote HTN and CVD. Vitamin D deficiency in patients with T2DM is almost twice that of non-diabetics, and most of the randomized clinical trials evaluating vitamin D supplementation in uncomplicated T2DM have demonstrated BP reductions, suggesting a possible effect in this population. Thus, the goal of this application is to identify the molecular mechanisms by which vitamin D deficiency promotes HTN in the setting of T2DM. Our preliminary data indicates that mice with macrophage- specific deletion of the VDR (KODMAC) were hypertensive with increased systemic renin, activation of the macrophage renin angiotensin system (RAS) in the aorta, and renal macrophage infiltration into the juxtaglomerular (JG) apparatus, the main source of renin production. Peritoneal macrophages from KODMAC or their media activated JG cell renin production via macrophage secretion of miR106b. This effect was blunted by lack of macrophage ER stress-regulated (C/EBP) homologous protein (CHOP). Similar effects were found with macrophages from vitamin D-deficient mice or from vitamin D-deficient patients with T2DM. Thus, we hypothesize that vitamin D-deficient macrophages increase systemic renin and hypertension in T2DM via increased secretion of miR-106b, stimulating renin secretion by JG cells, and/or via macrophage RAS-dependent mechanism. To test this hypothesis, Aim 1 will determine whether bone marrow (BM) transplant from miR-106b-/- or CHOP-/- into vitamin D-deficient mice improves HTN and decreases systemic renin. In Aim 2, we will evaluate whether BM transplant from Renin 1c-/- into vitamin D-deficient mice improves HTN and decreases systemic renin. In Aim 3, we will also assess the role of these inflammatory mechanisms of HTN in patients with T2DM and vitamin D deficiency by correlating changes in plasma miR-106b levels with changes in blood pressure after vitamin D supplementation (Aim 3a) and by testing whether monocytes or serum from vitamin D-deficient diabetics with HTN induce JG cell renin secretion via miR-106b (Aim 3b). This proposal will identify the mechanisms by which vitamin D deficiency regulates the innate immune system to induce systemic renin production and HTN in type 2 diabetes and thus, provide new therapeutic targets for these pervasive diseases.  ","PROJECT NARRATIVE  It is well-recognized that chronic inflammation integrates insulin resistance with hypertension and cardiovascular complications, but the mechanisms are undefined. We found that cell-specific deletion of the macrophage vitamin D receptor in mice is sufficient to cause renin-dependent hypertension, which corrects with bone marrow (BM) transplantation of cells with intact VDR. This study will determine whether macrophage RAS activation and/or miR106b secretion are critical mechanism by which vitamin D-deficiency increased systemic renin and induce hypertension in a mouse model of insulin resistance and in patients with type 2 diabetes.  ",

This career training award would allow her to pursue formal training through a Master's degree in Clinical and Translational Research, with a focus on designing interventions and conducting clinical trials to improve maternal and neonatal outcomes in obese pregnancy. She will benefit from the experience of an expert mentoring team. Her primary mentor will be Dr. Simin Meydani, Professor of Nutrition and Immunology at Tufts University and a renowned expert in micronutrient intervention studies. Her co-mentors will be Dr. Marlene Goldman, an expert in antioxidant interventions and reproductive health, Dr. David Greenblatt, an expert in pharmacologic interventions and obesity and Dr. Norma Terrin, an expert in clinical trial design.

The proposed research project, 'BMI-based prenatal vitamins to ameliorate oxidative stress in obese pregnancy,' is a novel intervention aimed at decreasing oxidative stress and inflammation, key abnormalities in the intrauterine milieu of obese pregnancy. Dr. Sen previously identified the importance of oxidative stress in the causative pathway of intergenerational obesity in an animal model, and her pilot data shows that oxidative stress is markedly increased, and anti-oxidant defenses markedly depleted, in obese pregnant women. This trial is a logical extension of this previous work. Her central hypothesis is that obese pregnancy is characterized by an oxidant/anti-oxidant imbalance, which increases inflammation and adversely impacts maternal health and neonatal outcome. Restoring oxidant/anti-oxidant balance with a body mass index-based prenatal micronutrient supplement will decrease oxidative stress and inflammation and improve both maternal and neonatal outcomes in obese pregnancy. This hypothesis will be tested in a randomized controlled trial in obese pregnant women. Given its overwhelming current and future impact, innovative approaches to diminish the effect of maternal obesity on future generations are of paramount public health importance.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: One out of three pregnant women is obese, predisposing the next generation to obesity and metabolic dysregulation. Interventions to ameliorate the adverse effects of obese pregnancy are of paramount importance in arresting the propagation of this vicious cycle.

While existing techniques such as cryoablation or surgical excision are generally curative, those treatments cause scarring that can be especially disfiguring in patients at high risk for skin cancer (i.e., patients with chronic severe photodamage; immunosuppression due to organ transplantation; or Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome, BCNS). Photodynamic therapy (PDT) combines a photosensitizer (protoporphyrin PpIX, induced by the administration of aminolevulic acid, ALA) with activation by visible light, and is a completely nonscarring technique. PDT is approved by the FDA for field treatment of widespread cutaneous precancers, and in European countries PDT is also approved for treating SCC and BCC. In the U.S. however, approval of PDT for SCC and BCC will require further clinical trials to demonstrate an efficacy similar to existing techniques (destructive ablation). As a new way to increase PDT efficacy, we showed that in animal models of SCC and BCC, transient administration of Vitamin D (VD) prior to ALA-PDT enhances PpIX accumulation and PDT efficacy. The oral (dietary) form of VD (cholecalciferol; D3, given as 10,000 IU/day for 10 days) increases PDT-induced tumor killing by several fold, and is very safe with little risk for inducing hypercalcemia. In this grant, we propose to test this approach in human clinical trials using oral D3 as a neoadjuvant to PDT. Aim 1 will examine the relationship between VD status (serium 25OH-D3) and PDT efficacy for CIS. Subaim 1a is a longitudinal study to test the correlation between serum 25OH-D3 levels and treatment outcomes in routine PDT patients in our clinics, and to examine the predictive value of certain biomarkers (e.g. VDR allelic polymorphisms). Subaim 1b is an interventional trial to assess the benefit of giving neoadjuvant D3 (transient oral D3) prior to PDT. Results from combined D3/PDT treatment (Subaim 1b) will be compared to results after D3 alone (Subaim 1a), stratified by the VD deficiency status. In Aim 2, we will examine the potential benefit of neoadjuvant D3/PDT in patients with BCNS (Gorlin-Goltz syndrome). These patients, who have multiple BCC tumors will receive 3 bimonthly PDT treatments, and rates of tumor shrinkage will be correlated with serum 25OH-D3 levels. Each patient will serve as his/her own control by randomizing the order of the first two PDT treatments, one session to be done with neoadjuvant D3 and the other without. The third PDT treatment will occur after the serum VD level has been adjusted to normal levels with D3 supplements. This approach will allow us to determine whether neoadjuvant D3/PDT can help all patients, even the VD deficient individuals, through customization of D3 dose. Together, we expect this group of clinical trials to establish the foundation for a new treatment modality, i.e., neoadjuvant D3/PDT for skin cancer. The potential benefit for public health is that data showing improved efficacy of PDT with this safe and simple approach will lay the foundation for a nonscarring alternative to surgery for early SCC and BCC tumors.","PROJECT NARRATIVE This is a proposal to develop a new combination regimen that combines Vitamin D3 pretreatment with photodynamic therapy (PDT), as a nonsurgical and non-scarring alternative for the treatment of skin cancer. In clinical trials, we will test the hypothesis that oral Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) will boost the levels of target photosensitizer (protoporphyrin IX) in widespread squamous cell precancers and in basal cell carcinoma, and improve the therapeutic response to PDT. Our study population will comprise patients at high risk, including organ transplant recipients and patients with the Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome. The potential benefit to public health is a safe, efficacious, and non-scarring alternative to surgery for the treatment of skin cancer.",

A major breakthrough for prevention and cure has been the appreciation that breast cancer is not one disease, rather a collection of cancer subtypes becoming better defined by improved methodologies based upon histopathologic, genetic and molecular signatures. Over time we have applied histological type, grade, tumor size, lymph-node involvement, and estrogen receptor (ER) and HER-2/neu receptor status to help define prognosis and probability of response to therapies, yet these alone have not fully captured the varied behavior of breast cancer. The field is now rapidly progressing with gene expression and proteomic signatures that will help 'personalize' our interventions for individuals. This same concept is relevant to interventions for primary or secondary prevention and is the focus of our translational grant application.

Thus, our central hypothesis is that the development of aggressive breast cancer sub-types such as of ERPR(-)HER-2/neu(+) or ERPR(-)HER-2/neu(-) (i.e. triple negative) disease may be uniquely responsive to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), the long chain ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) found in fish oil. As a first step towards a future definitive prevention trial in women, we propose to test the efficacy of an ω-3 rich fish il supplement to modulate breast biomarkers indicative of anti-carcinogenic action. We will randomize high risk survivors to a placebo-low dose or high dose ω-3 rich fish oil capsule treatment and employ our breast fine needle aspiration techniques to obtain cells and tissue for analysis of biomarkers of exposure and efficacy. Our multidisciplinary team has developed the following Specific Aims to: (1) Determine the effects of dietary ω-3 fatty acids on biomarkers of exposure and response in women at high risk for recurrent estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor breast cancer +/- HER-2/neu overexpression; and (2) Define the role of dietary ω-3 PUFAs in the epigenetic regulation of the inflammatory responses underlying mammary carcinogenesis as a novel mechanism for the effects of ω-3 PUFAs. Development of these biomarkers of ω-3 PUFA exposure and response will enable the assessment of this bioactive food component in future large-scale prevention trials for women at risk for recurrence of ERPR(-)HER-2/neu(+) or triple negative breast cancer.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The genetic and molecular heterogeneity of breast cancer accounts for wide variability in clinical response and outcome and thus mandates the development of innovative targeted therapies and prevention strategies. The unresolved role of dietary fat content and specifically ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in human breast carcinogenesis, despite compelling pre-clinical studies, raises the possibility that response to dietary fat depends on critical nutrient-gene interactions that may vary between subjects and/or breast cancer subtypes. This study aims to determine the effects of dietary ω-3 fatty acids on biomarkers of exposure and response in women at high risk for recurrent estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor negative breast cancer +/- HER- 2/neu overexpression and their role in the epigenetic regulation of the inflammatory responses underlying mammary carcinogenesis.",

SELECT was a Phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the effect of selenium and vitamin E, alone and in combination, on prostate cancer incidence. SELECT randomized 35,533 men between 2001-2004. PCPT, also a Phase III, double-blind trial, randomized 18,882 men to either finasteride or placebo between 1994-1997. Although schedules and requirements varied between the two, substantial serum, plasma, white blood cells and prostate tissue were collected on both, resulting in rich biorepositories. Each had extensive prospective data collections which included diet and supplements, quality of life, physical activity, medications, other cancer diagnoses, cardiovascular endpoints, and treatment adverse events. Although there have been significant scientific collaborations to date, there remain numerous opportunities to further interrogate the clinical database and biobanks. additionally, a number of serum and plasma measures and genotyping data have already been obtained and are available for other investigators to use. Now that the clinical trial portion is completed, these cohorts can be used for epidemiologic research. Also, SELECT continues to actively follow a subset of men who can be contacted for additional data. We request funds to provide a stable infrastructure to support the serum repository for PCPT and tissue repository for PCPT and SELECT (all located at the University of Colorado) and to support the ongoing data analysis applications from both trials. We will continue our efforts to obtain prostate tissue from men diagnosed with prostate cancer on SELECT, and we will obtain cause of death information from a National Death Index search. By continuing to fund the Statistical Center team and some of our key scientific colleagues, we are able to help investigators apply for additional funding to conduct studies using our rich biologic repositories and clinical databases from PCPT and SELECT.

During our initial period of funding, we launched VITAL-DKD as an ancillary study to the parent Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial (VITAL). Specifically, to the large (N=25,875) and simple parent VITAL trial, we added kidney outcomes and accompanying clinical data to a subset of 1,322 VITAL participants with prevalent type 2 diabetes to test the effects of vitamin D3 and omega-3 fatty acids on the clinical manifestations of DKD. In this competitive renewal application, we propose to extend follow-up of our VITAL DKD ancillary study from 2 to 5 years, add measurements to stored specimens to more comprehensively evaluate treatment effects, and assess intermediate cardiovascular outcomes that complement our primary renal outcome. Our approach builds on our recruited study population and completed measurements and leverages the infrastructure of the parent VITAL trial, which is funded by the NIH to provide study treatments and basic data acquisition through 2017. We have recruited a diverse study population with type 2 diabetes that has or is at risk of DKD and is maintaining excellent adherence to study medications. To extend our study, our experienced study team will apply methods developed and successfully implemented during our initial funding period. Preliminary data demonstrate high retention and adherence rates and successful laboratory protocols. We anticipate that the additional studies proposed herein, when added to those of the initial funding period, will generate a comprehensive evaluation of the long-term effects of vitamin D3 and omega-3 fatty acids on DKD.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The prevalence of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is rising due to the growing burden of type 2 diabetes and despite increased application of intensive glucose control and renin-angiotensin system inhibitors. Moreover, DKD is strongly associated with cardiovascular disease and mortality. To mitigate the growing public health burden of DKD, new approaches are needed to prevent DKD as well as its progression and CVD sequelae. Vitamin D3 and omega-3 fatty acids are sufficiently accessible, inexpensive, and safe to apply to the large at- risk diabetes population if found to be effective in clinical trials.",

Evidence for a role of these agents in preventing cancer, CVD, and other diseases remains inconclusive regarding causality and insufficient to inform nutritional recommendations for primary prevention. Appropriately designed randomized trials in general populations are lacking. To fill this knowledge gap, we have been conducting VITAL, a highly innovative, cost-efficient, large-scale, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical tria among 26,000 U.S. men and women without cancer or CVD at baseline, who have been selected only on age (men aged e50 and women aged e55), with an oversampling of blacks (ne5000). In a 2x2 factorial design, participants have been randomized to vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol, 2000 IU/d) and marine omega-3 fatty acids (Omacor(R) fish oil, 1 g/d, containing eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] + docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) supplements (or placebos) independently. Contingent on continued funding, the median treatment period will be 5 years. During the first cycle, we have successfully met or surpassed our recruitment goals, enrolled a racially/ethnically diverse cohort, collected baseline blood/DNA samples on >16,000 participants (with plans for follow-up bloods in 6000), and conducted extensive validation studies of the laboratory assays for vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid measurements in the trial. Annual follow-up questionnaires assess treatment compliance (confirmed by blood samples in a subset of participants), side effects, endpoint occurrence, and cancer and vascular risk factors. Self-reported endpoints are confirmed by medical record review by physicians blinded to treatment assignment, and deaths are ascertained through the National Death Index-Plus and other sources. Our archived blood samples allow assessment of effect modification by baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid levels, changes in biomarkers over time, and testing of genetic/biochemical hypotheses. With our scientific colleagues, we have obtained funding for 18 ancillary studies to evaluate the role of these supplements in preventing other chronic diseases (including diabetes, cognitive decline, depression, and autoimmune disorders), and established an in-clinic component for in-depth phenotyping of a subcohort (n=1000). The trial is expected to provide either definitive positive or informative null results for our primary hypotheses and will serve as a national resource for research on the health effects of vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids, with opportunities for extensive collaborations.

Health effects associated with WSP include acute bronchitis, asthma exacerbation, pneumonia, cough and systemic inflammation in in healthy persons and those with asthma. Cardiovascular effects have also been reported with WSP exposure. WSP from wildland fires can cause abrupt increases in ambient air PM 2.5 levels, and avoidance of rapidly increasing PM air pollution is not feasible as many residents cannot leave the burn region, and wildland firefighters move into wildland fire sites, often for several consecutive days. As avoidance of PM is not feasible in these settings, there is a clear unmet need for interventions to reduce adverse health effects caused by acute WSP exposure. Our team has developed gamma tocopherol (gT), an isoform of vitamin E with robust anti-inflammatory actions, as a chemopreventive intervention for inflammation caused by environmental contaminants. Our animal studies show that gT inhibits allergen, ozone and endotoxin-induced airway inflammation. Our human phase I studies show that gT decreases inflammatory response of circulating monocytes, decreases nitrosative stress, and inhibits neutrophil (PMN) influx to the airway in vivo after endotoxin challenge. Thus, gT supplementation is an attractive nutritional/nutraceutical approach to decreasing the adverse health effects of inhaled WSP. We have also developed a 500µg/m3 WSP exposure protocol which induces both airway and systemic increases in PMNs in human volunteers. Using this challenge protocol, we will undertake a randomized, placebo-controlled study to determine if of supplementation with 1200 mg of on WSP-induced airway and systemic PMN increases in healthy and asthmatic volunteers. Exploratory endpoints will include non-specific bronchial reactivity (NSBR), and cardiovascular responses reported to be impacted by PM exposure. These studies will also allow us to compare responses of allergic asthmatic (AA) and healthy volunteers (HV) to determine if atopy or other facets of asthma modify risk for inflammatory response to WSP. This study will be the first to test a specific nutritional supplement as a chemopreventive intervention for WSP-induced inflammation in either AAs or NVs, and to specifically compare the response of these groups to WSP-induced inflammation.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we will examine the ability of supplementation with gamma tocopherol (gT), a form of naturally occurring vitamin E, to prevent lung and systemic inflammation following exposure to wood smoke particles (WSP) in healthy and asthmatic volunteers. WSPs from wildfires are a major contributor to air pollution. Many people cannot escape areas where there is increased fire related WSP air pollution, so safe and inexpensive treatments (such as gT) are urgently needed to prevent environmentally-induced lung disease.",

Although vitamin D supplements are widely used to improve bone health, evidence for a role of supplemental vitamin D alone in reducing fractures is lacking. While the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] level is considered the best analyte to assess vitamin D status, currently there is no consensus on the optimal circulating total 25(OH)D concentration for bone. While, like many hormones, vitamin D circulates bound to proteins, the relative importance of free 25(OH)D (FVD) or bioavailable 25(OH)D levels on fracture risk is not known. New advances in technology make it possible to directly measure the biologically active, FVD level. Results from recent observational studies on whether FVD and/or bioavailable 25(OH)D are more strongly associated than total 25(OH)D levels with calcium homeostasis and bone mineral density (BMD) are inconsistent. In addition, there are no data from large, randomized controlled trials on whether bioavailable 25(OH)D and/or FVD vs. total 25(OH)D levels or gene variations in vitamin D-related pathways modify effects of supplemental vitamin D on fractures and changes in BMD. To fill gaps in knowledge, we propose an ancillary study to the large, NIH-sponsored, randomized, controlled VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) that is testing effects of supplemental vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol, 2000 IU/d), and/or omega-3 fatty acids (fish oil, 1 g/d) in the primary prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease in 25,874 U.S. men (aged ≥50) and women (aged ≥55), including 5,107 African Americans. The proposed ancillary study will definitively determine whether supplemental, high-dose, vitamin D3 alone reduces incident total, non-vertebral and hip fractures by extending adjudication of fractures to the full 5 years of treatment in 25,874 VITAL participants nationwide. The proposed studies will also rigorously test whether concentrations of bioavailable 25(OH)D and/or FVD are more strongly associated with changes in BMD and incident fractures than total 25(OH)D levels; and whether these vitamin D biomarkers and genetic variants in vitamin D-related pathways modify effects of supplemental vitamin D on BMD and fracture risk. For each of the proposed aims, we will assess whether results vary by (a) sex, (b) race/ethnicity, and (c) BMI. Key VITAL resources will be leveraged at no additional cost to the proposed studies including: blood samples and BMD measurements (at baseline and follow-up), extensive data on changes in 25(OH)D levels over time (in the treatment vs. placebo arms), measures of calcium homeostasis, information on clinical risk factors, and extracted DNA. This proposal provides a unique and cost- efficient opportunity to generate important positive or informative negative results about effects of supplemental vitamin D3 alone on fracture risk, while also elucidating the relative importance of vitamin D biomarkers and genetic variations in vitamin D-related pathways on bone. Findings from the proposed ancillary study have the potential for major clinical as well as public health impact for both men and women in the U.S.","NARRATIVE Vitamin D supplements are widely promoted for bone health, but definitive data on benefits and risks of high- dose, supplemental vitamin D on fracture prevention are lacking.

Despite compelling evidence implicating vitamin D in CRC, critical questions remain about whether these findings reflect a true causal relationship, and what the biological mech- anisms of vitamin D activity are. Our central hypothesis is that vitamin D supplementation to achieve sufficient levels of 25(OH)D leads to improved survival in CRC patients and influences several neoplastic pathways that can be exploited as biomarkers of efficacy and targets for novel treatment strategies. We will test this hypothe- sis within two novel randomized clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation: a) a phase II double-blind random- ized trial of high- versus low-dose vitamin D3 in combination with chemotherapy in patients with metastatic CRC, and b) a randomized trial of preoperative high-dose vitamin D3 versus placebo in patients with resectable colon cancer for examination of vitamin D biology in fresh human tumor tissue. We will also lever- age a rich prospective cohort of metastatic CRC patients enrolled in a completed NCI-sponsored phase III trial of chemotherapy (CALGB/SWOG 80405) to further define and validate biomarkers of vitamin D action. In Aim 1, we will determine the impact of supplemental vitamin D on survival of CRC patients, test distinct hypotheses about the vitamin D dose-response relationship, and explore biomarkers of vitamin D status, response, and efficacy. We will investigate whether circulating levels of vitamin D binding protein and tumoral expression of vitamin D receptor, 1α-hydroxylase, and 24-hydroxylase are associated with improved survival within our ran- domized trials, and whether these markers modify the relationship between vitamin D and patient outcome. In Aim 2, we will conduct a precision medicine analysis of vitamin D to elucidate the mechanistic basis for its anti- tumor activity in CRC. We will explore the impact of vitamin D supplementation on tumoral markers of inflam- mation, lymphocytic infiltrates, and inflammatory gene signatures in surgical colectomy specimens from pa- tients treated with high-dose preoperative vitamin D3 versus placebo. We will also perform next generation se- quencing and Nanostring analysis of tumors from CRC patients with high- versus low vitamin D status to identi- fy unique genetic and transcriptional signatures associated with vitamin D-mediated carcinogenesis. In sum- mary, this translational proposal leverages innovative randomized trials of vitamin D to take the next critical steps in understanding vitamin D activity and biology in CRC. Our findings will confirm causality, provide new insights into biomarkers of vitamin D activity, and lead to potential inclusion of vitamin D into standard therapy – including immunotherapy – with the ultimate goal of improving the survival of patients with CRC.","PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the U.S., and may plausibly be linked to vitamin D deficiency. Abundant preclinical and epide- miologic data link lower levels of vitamin D to increased risk of and mortality from colorectal cancer; this is par- ticularly relevant given increasing rates of vitamin D deficiency in the U.S., as well as profound racial disparities in vitamin D status and colorectal cancer incidence and mortality. In an era of expensive and often toxic anti- neoplastic drugs, vitamin D therefore represents an attractive and accessible treatment option for patients of all races and sociodemographic groups with respect to both safety and cost.",

The trial began recruitment in 1985 and was halted in January 1996, 21 months ahead of schedule, with the twin conclusions of no benefit and substantial evidence of a harmful effect of the intervention on both lung cancer incidence and total mortality. Participants continued to be followed for over nine years post-intervention, with updated lung cancer incidence and cardiovascular disease mortality findings published in 2004. On June 30, 2005, CARET stopped active follow- up of participants. During the active intervention phase of CARET, serum, plasma, whole blood (for DNA), and lung tissue specimens were collected. These biospecimens make up the CARET biorepository, which is the focus of this application. The CARET biorepository is a key tool in studying disease development and progression. It is an invaluable legacy of the parent trial with specimens available to any investigator with a hypothesis-driven project. The specific aims of the current grant cycle (2013-2018) included extending the database and online accessibility to include participant use of micronutrient, mineral, and vitamin supplements; baseline laboratory values; and stage at diagnosis of lung, prostate, colon, and breast cancer cases. We also extended CARET follow-up of cancer diagnoses, deaths, and causes of death through 2012/13 via linkages to the National Death Index, Cancer Registry of Connecticut, and the Cancer Registries of California and Washington. This has greatly increased the total numbers of identified incident cancer cases (n=6,773) as well as extending the follow-up of the entire cohort (median follow-up to first diagnosis is 18 years and to death is 20 years). In our goal to make the CARET biorepository accessible, during the current grant cycle (2013 – 2018), biospecimens and /or data have been provided to investigators, which have resulted in 23 peer-reviewed publications. Currently there are 93 ongoing projects utilizing CARET biospecimens. In this application, we request funds to continue support of the CARET biorepository and the associated extensive database. We also propose to pilot procedures to obtain updated signed releases of medical records and consent for the utilization of biologic material in the CARET biorepositories consistent with recent developments on obtaining consent for broad research purposes and data sharing. In addition, to position CARET for studies examining the association of tumor heterogeneity and molecular subtypes with etiologic factors and survival, we propose to conduct a pilot to obtain diagnostic lung cancer biopsy/surgical specimens from Washington State CARET participants diagnosed after 2003. This will include obtaining updated release of medical records and consent for broad research purposes and data sharing.","Project Narrative The CARET biorepository has longitudinally collected pre-diagnostic serum and plasma samples as well as DNA samples on 18,314 participants at high risk for lung cancer, with demographic, life style, and nutrition characteristics, and 20 years of follow-up for cancer incidence, survival, and cause of death. This well- maintained specimen bank makes the CARET Biorepository well suited to any investigator who proposes to study the molecular, genetic, and nutritional epidemiology, as well as markers for early detection, diagnosis, and prognosis of the common cancers in both men and women. This proposal seeks funding to support biorepository maintenance and personnel to continue participation and support of investigator-initiated projects utilizing the repository, and to pilot the collection of lung cancer tissue and treatment records for data sharing projects on tumor heterogeneity and “personalized medicine” treatment. ",

Kidney disease is associated with a significantly increased risk of morbidity and mortality even before reaching end-stage kidney disease. Animal studies and observational studies in humans, including studies by investigators leading this proposed study, suggest that vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids may be protective against kidney disease. Despite the evidence base available, there is still no definitive study testing the effects of these relatively safe nutritional supplements on kidney disease progression in humans. We now have an opportunity to provide such data in a highly feasible and cost-efficient manner. We propose to take advantage of the VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) trial to test whether vitamin D3 (at a dose of 2,000 IU/day) or omega-3 fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic acid plus docosahexaenoic acid, 1 gm/day) will preserve kidney function, as measured by serum creatinine and cystatin C, over a 4 year period. The VITAL trial is an NIH funded, placebo-controlled clinical trial randomizing 25,875 participants (men older than 50 and women older than 55 years) in a 2x2 factorial design to vitamin D3 versus placebo and omega-3 fatty acids versus placebo for 5 years to evaluate effects on cardiovascular disease and cancer events. The VITAL trial is not currently planning to evaluate kidney function in participants with hypertension. We, therefore, propose to measure serum creatinine and cystatin C and urinary albumin and creatinine at year 4 post-randomization in 4000 participants of the VITAL trial who at baseline have hypertension, no diabetes mellitus, are older than 60 years and have pre-randomization blood samples available collected by the parent study.

We will evaluate changes in estimated GFR calculated by serum creatinine and cystatin C levels over a 4 year period, the incidence of end-stage renal disease, prevalent albuminuria at year 4 and parathyroid hormone, calcium and FGF-23 levels at baseline and year 4 in the subset with eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73m2.

In this application, we propose to examine the role of the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin, and its primary regulator vitamin D, in lung function impairment, respiratory infections and acute exacerbations of COPD as well as evaluate the effect of oral vitamin D supplementation on lung cathelicidin levels in humans. Cathelicidin has bactericidal and inflammatory activities in the lung and is regulated by vitamin D levels. Our hypothesis is that reduced cathelicidin levels are associated with accelerated lung function decline though a pathway partially mediated by increased infections and COPD exacerbations. We hypothesize the effect of cathelicidin on lung function is greater in those with vitamin D insufficiency and that oral vitamin D supplementation will raise cathelicidin levels in the pulmonary compartment, thereby restoring lung cathelicidin deficiency. Specifically, through longitudinal investigation nested within an ongoing cohort study of urban, predominantly African-American individuals at high risk for development of OLDs, we will characterize the rate of lung function decline in 380 participants followed with serial spirometry measures for up to six years. Baseline and repeated measures of cathelicidin and vitamin D will be examined as independent predictors of lung function decline and respiratory infections. Separately, using longitudinal data from 2100 participants enrolled in the Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study (SPIROMICS) study with established COPD, baseline measures of blood cathelicidin and vitamin D will be examined as an independent predictor of longitudinal FEV1 decline and COPD exacerbations over three years. In both cohorts, concurrent vitamin D measurements will permit evaluation of antecedent and modifier on the cathelicidin-lung outcomes relationships. Finally, we will measure blood and lung lavage cathelicidin levels in 40 vitamin D insufficient individuals before and after eight weeks of oral vitamin D supplementation to determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on cathelicidin levels. Completion of these aims will provide a robust determination of the role of cathelicidin in lung function decline and adverse pulmonary outcomes in unique populations of at-risk and diseased individuals. Moreover, the aims of this application directly or indirectly wor towards ultimately understanding if a readily measurable blood marker, cathelicidin, can inform who may benefit from vitamin D supplementation to prevent chronic lung disease. The results from this application would lead to a therapeutic intervention study that will provide further opportunities to improve our understanding of the relationship between vitamin D, cathelicidin and lung function.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal will evaluate a potential mechanism of increased risk of lung function impairment, as well as determine if vitamin D replacement can alter this pathway. This application will improve the understanding of factors which can lead to chronic lung disease. If effective, this application would also provide the justification to study vitamin D as a therapy to improve lung health.",

The parent project for this K01 award is a Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation-sponsored randomized control trial called Women First (clinicaltrials.gov NCT01883193). Women first is a large mother-infant longitudinal birth cohort in the 3rd world (4 international sites) that is investigating whether timing of nutritional intervention can improve maternal and infant outcomes. This K01 award will examine one international site (Guatemala) that is prone to both growth stunting and obesity. My proposed research project will assess changes in DNA methylation in umbilical cord blood (UCB) from infants born to lean or obese mothers who consumed micronutrient supplementation (MNS) for ≥ 3 months prior to conception (Arm 1), MNS commenced at 12 wk gestation (Arm 2), or no supplementation (Arm 3) and offspring susceptibility for stunted growth (birth length) and obesity (weight-for-length Z-score). My primary hypothesis is that maternal nutritional and metabolic status, prior to conception, will result in differentially methylation regions (DMRs) in umbilical cord blood (UCB) associated with linear growth and susceptibility to obesity. Specifically, I propose 3 novel approaches to examine the effects of pre-conception MNS and pre-pregnancy BMI on the infant epigenome: SA1) Identification of differentially methylated regions using Roche - NimbleGen SeqCap Epi SA2) Assessing DNA methylation of newly identified obesity-associated metastable epialleles SA3) Use 2-step Mendelian Randomization to strengthen causal inference of my postulated pathway: Maternal MNS & pre-pregnancy BMI → ∆ DNA methylation → infant outcome (birth length & body weight)  Due to limited experience assessing epigenetics in large clinical cohorts, I have devised a specific training plan to acquire epigenetic, clinical, and analytical skills. I hve identified mentors at Anschutz Medical Campus who are highly productive leaders in developmental programming and obesity (Dr. Jed Friedman), international nutrition and pediatrics (Dr. Nancy Krebs), epigenetics (Dr. Ivana Yang), bioinformatics (Dr. Kenneth Jones), and epidemiology (Dr. Dana Dabalea). My training plan will also take advantage of 2 key international experts i) Dr. Caroline Relton, who has pioneered 2-step Mendelian randomization, and ii) Dr. John Greally, who has helped innovate the SeqCap Epi methodology with Roche-NimbleGen as well as numerous other epigenetic-related accolades. My training plan encompasses cutting edge epigenetic analysis tools, an outstanding network of advisors, and an innovative tool-kit to facilitate a successful transition to an independent career in translatioal epigenetics and the developmental origins of obesity.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    This project will provide a deeper understanding about how the timing of maternal nutritional interventions may impact infant and child development, and risk for growth and metabolic complications such as obesity and insulin resistance. These studies not only include the first '1000 days of life', but also incorporate the time period leading up to conception (≥ 3 months prior to conception). Growing evidence suggests that maternal nutritional status before pregnancy may be more important for infant health. Importantly, discovering informative biomarkers, at birth,that may be predictive for later risk of impaired growth and non-communicable disease risk may lead to better recommendations to improve maternal and child health",

Despite advances in medical treatment of HF, mortality after HF onset and rate of recurrent HF decompensation remain high, underscoring an urgent need to identify effective prevention strategies. Observational studies showed a higher risk of death in HF patients with lower levels of vitamin D and two recent post-hoc analyses of trials conducted in mostly post- menopausal women reported a reduction in HF rates in the vitamin D group compared with placebo. Vitamin D has also been reported to improve hemodynamics and left ventricular remodeling in 229 HF patients. However, no randomized trial has examined the effects of vitamin D on primary prevention of HF or on the rate of recurrent HF decompensation in men and women. Efficacy of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on cardiovascular events has been reported in trials with low prevalence of stain use only. EPA/DHA can reduce risk factors for HF including myocardial infarction, hypertension, and diabetes. While some but not all observational studies have suggested an inverse association between EPA/DHA and the incidence of HF, no large primary prevention trial of EPA/DHA on HF has been conducted. In addition, effect modification of the effects of EPA/DHA on HF by statin has not been elucidated. This project will investigate the effects of vitamin D and EPA/DHA supplements on the incidence rate of HF and on recurrent HF decompensation in an ancillary study of the VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL), an NIH-funded randomized controlled trial of 25,874 men and women testing the efficacy of 2,000 IU/day cholecalciferol and 1 g/day EPA/DHA on cardiovascular disease and cancer endpoints.","Narrative Every year, about 900,000 Americans develop heart failure and fewer than fifty percent of those will be alive five years after the diagnosis.

One of the most common indications for probiotic treatment is the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). Unfortunately, the efficacy of many probiotic products used for AAD is not supported by rigorous independent research, and often results in non-evidence-based usage. Our research group has worked closely with the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) to move research forward for the most well studied Bifidobacterium strain, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (B. lactis) BB-12 (BB-12), via an Investigational New Drug pathway. We have previously conducted two Phase I, safety trials and as per FDA requirements, are now proposing a Phase II trial that will examine efficacy and monitor safety of BB-12 in preventing AAD. The investigational product delivers a stable high dosage of BB-12, consistent with the findings of a Cochrane review for preventing AAD using other strains studied outside of the United States. To explore possible mechanisms responsible for BB-12 effects in ameliorating AAD, we will also study the gut microbiota composition and function by collecting five fecal samples at multiple time points from all participants. The gut microbiota includes hundreds of species of facultative and obligate anaerobes, and its disruption is hypothesized to be an important factor in the development of AAD. AIM 1: To test the efficacy of high dose, BB-12-supplemented yogurt in preventing AAD, compared to yogurt without BB-12, in children receiving antibiotics. Hypothesis: Children receiving antibiotics who receive the yogurt with BB-12 will demonstrate less diarrhea than those receiving a control yogurt without BB-12. AIM 2: To assess the safety of yogurt supplemented with BB-12. Hypothesis: Yogurt containing BB-12 will be safe and well-tolerated in this larger pediatric population. This is a Phase II trial that requires additional safety evaluation of high dose BB-12. AIM 3: To carry out longitudinal community structure and gene expression analysis of fecal microbiota to evaluate the impact of high dose BB-12 in a pediatric population receiving antibiotics. Hypotheses: (i) Administration of antibiotics will alter the composition and gene expression profile of the gut microbiota in pediatric patients, and (ii) concomitant ingestion of BB-12 in yogurt will mitigate the antibiotic- induced disturbance in the gut microbiota, as identified using 16S rRNA and metatranscriptomic profiling.

Given recent appreciation of the profound affect that the gut microbiome has on host human health and disease, with support of this supplement we will be performing the first pilot study to compare and contrast the impact of the most widely used oral vitamin D supplement (vitamin D3) versus the more rapidly acting, experimental 25-hydroxylated metabolite, 25D3, on the gut-residing microbes that have the first opportunity to encounter and respond to those vitamin D metabolites. With support from this supplement, we wish to take advantage of the still-recruiting, multi-ethnic vitamin D replacement trial comparing oral administration of vitamin D3 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25D3) in vitamin D deficient subjects (total serum 25D ≤20 ng/ml) set forth in Specific Aim 3 of the parent grant R01AR063910. This application includes a plan for supplemental analysis of the gut microbiome in those subjects before and after normalization of total and free serum 25D. We propose that i) there will exist predictable changes in the taxomic 16S rRNA-sequencing profiles of the stool microbiota and 2) the impact of that altered bacterial microbiome on the host's skeletal and immune homeostasis that will be conditioned by the form of vitamin D supplementation and the host's ethnicity (White, Black, Hispanic, Asian). These new analyses will i) compliment the already-funded program's novel assay technology for determining serum free 25D and 1,25D and ii) further advance our definition of `personalized' vitamin D health in terms of both classical (bone) and non-classical (immune) actions of vitamin D. !","RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH This supplemental R21 application challenges current research and clinical practice paradigms which do not consider the potential effects of orally administered, bone-active agents on the gut microbiota nor how this might explain inter-individual differences in response to a “standardized dose” of the oral agent.

The radical cystectomy operation is fraught with the highest complication rates of all urologic oncology surgeries performed and is also extremely catabolic. As the National Cancer Institute has identified in its provocative questions 2 & 11, variations in immune function and nutritional interventions affect the response to cancer treatment. Radical cystectomy will continue to save lives, but there is a high cost in terms of persistent surgical complications. The long-term goal of this project is to unlock the potential of nutrition interventions to improve outcomes, survival, and quality of life in cancer patients. The objective of this project is to determine the impact of a specialized form of nutritional support on surgical outcomes and to better understand the mechanisms by which it acts. The hypothesis is that perioperative use of a specialized form of nutritional support will have greater efficacy than a standard form of nutritional support to reduce post- operative complications. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of published preliminary data produced in the applicants' laboratories and expert guidelines calling for more rigorous study of this approach. The rationale is that Specialized IMmunonutrition (SIM) is fortified with nutrients (L-arginine, omega-3 fatty acids, dietary nucleotides, and vitamin A) that have immediate effects on immune and inflammatory responses, muscle sparing, and wound healing after surgery. Guided by strong preliminary data, the hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: 1) To determine the impact of perioperative SIM versus an identical Oral Nutrition Support (ONS) lacking the immuno-modulators on post-operative complications from RC; 2) To compare the impact of SIM to ONS on secondary clinical outcomes after RC surgery; 3) To evaluate the impact of consuming SIM compared to ONS for restraining myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), decreasing inflammation, and modulating nutrient metabolism. The project is significant because it offers a high yield, low-risk, low-cost strategy to improve the outcome of patients with bladder cancer who undergo RC. Our innovative approach could transform clinical practice to reduce post- operative complications, thereby diminishing the burden of bladder cancer surgery and has the added potential to help many other surgical patients beyond cystectomy.","PROJECT NARRATIVE The ultimate goal of this research is to unlock the potential of nutrition interventions to improve outcomes, survival, and quality of life in cancer patients.

Thus, finding factors that can lead to prevention of this disease would be of great public health importance. Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent among pregnant women, and thus, represents a potentially modifiable factor for the prevention of disease. Due to the effect of vitamin D in the development of the lung and the immune system in utero, we believe that vitamin D deficiency in pregnant mothers leads to increased risks for developing asthma and allergy in early childhood. Epidemiologic studies that have investigated the role of vitamin D in early life and the development of asthma, wheeze and allergy have inconsistent results. Because of the wide prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, a clinical trial is the only way t confidently answer the question of whether higher vitamin D levels in pregnancy can prevent asthma and allergies in the mother's offspring. Over the past 4 years, we have been conducting a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of maternal vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy, and we are now following the children (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00920621). We recruited 881 women, and randomized them to one of two arms: 4,000 IU vitamin D3 daily plus a prenatal vitamin containing 400 IU vitamin D3 vs. a placebo plus a prenatal vitamin containing 400 IU vitamin D3. We followed them through pregnancy and there were 810 live births with 801 currently under follow-up. The goal of the current project is to follow the children through age 6 years. The specific aims for the renewal of VDAART are: (1) to determine whether maternal supplementation of vitamin D during pregnancy is associated with reduced incidence of asthma in the child during the first 6 years of life; (2) to determine whether maternal supplementation of vitamin D during pregnancy is associated with reduced secondary outcomes in the child of: (a) allergic sensitization (total and specific IgE), (b) doctor's diagnosis of eczema, (c) doctor's diagnosis of allergic rhinitis, (d) food allergies and (e) lower respiratory tract infections by ag 6 years; (3) to determine whether maternal supplementation of vitamin D during pregnancy is associated with greater lung growth in the children up to age 6, as measured by impulse oscillometry and spirometry; and (4) to continue to collect biologic material from the children for mechanistic studies related to vitamin D in asthma and allergies, including specimens for genomic and epigenomic studies and microbiome studies.

As life expectancy increases, co-morbidities such as CF-related diabetes (CFRD) become more prevalent. It is thus increasingly important to identify pathophysiologic pathways that will inform nutritional therapies for adult patients with CF. Recent advances in metabolomics analysis provide a novel opportunity to broadly explore metabolism and underlying pathways relevant to disease exacerbation and recovery in CF. The PI, Jessica A. Alvarez, PhD, RD, will use high-resolution, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomics methods as a tool to interrogate the plasma metabolome in cohorts of adult CF patients, with or without CFRD, in collaboration with a multidisciplinary team of expert mentors (including Lead Mentor Dr. Thomas R. Ziegler and Co-Mentors Drs. Dean P. Jones, Vin Tangpricha, Arlene A. Stecenko, and Nael A. McCarty). Based on preliminary clinical and metabolomics research findings by the PI and the mentoring team, the working hypotheses of this project are: 1) aminothiol redox imbalance in CF contributes to impaired fatty acid �-oxidation, and 2) vitamin D supplementation normalizes the redox system and, subsequently, �-oxidation. Specific Aim 1 is to confirm a defect in �- oxidation in adult CF subjects using high-resolution targeted plasma metabolomics analysis and complementary in vivo bioenergetic assessment methods (indirect calorimetry,31phosphorus-magnetic resonance spectroscopy) in a cross-sectional study of adult subjects with CF compared to healthy, age matched controls. Specific Aim 2 will determine if plasma aminothiol redox status is associated with �-oxidation in this cross-sectional study. Specific Aim 3 is a pilot study to determine the impact of high-dose oral vitamin D3 on indexes of �-oxidation and aminothiol redox in adult CF patients hospitalized for pulmonary exacerbation and followed during clinical recovery in an ongoing, double-blind, randomized controlled trial. Emory University boasts an intellectually rich research environment whose resources will be used to carry out the proposed research, including an NIH-funded Atlanta Clinical and Translational Science Institute Clinical Research Network site. The primary goal of this K01 career development proposal is for Dr. Alvarez to develop expertise in high-resolution metabolomics for use in clinically oriented nutrition research, which will highly complement her nutrition and metabolism training to-date. The proposed research, in combination with a structured mentoring and training plan that includes didactic courses and workshops, is designed to facilitate Dr. Alvarez's long-term goal of developing an independently-funded clinical and translational nutrition research program in chronic catabolic diseases, such as CF, consistent with the mission of the NIDDK.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With better medical care, patients with cystic fibrosis, a life-threatening disease, are enjoying longer lives.

No pharmacologic therapies reliably prevent or treat AKI. Novel therapeutic targets for clinical intervention are therefore needed.  Vitamin D metabolites have important and potentially beneficial antiinflammatory effects which prevent AKI in animal models. Since vitamin D metabolites are often decreased in critical illness, we propose that deficiencies in the vitamin D axis may be risk factors for incident AKI, and that exogenous vitamin D metabolites may be novel therapeutic agents for AKI prevention. Our preliminary data support these hypotheses. We showed that patients with established AKI have decreased levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25D) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D) in association with elevated fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) levels; the latter is known to suppress both renal and extra-renal conversion of 25D to 1,25D. In further preliminary data, we recently published the results of a pilot RCT demonstrating that administration of a single 2 µg IV dose of 1,25D to critically il patients increases leukocyte mRNA expression of interleukin-10 (IL-10) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). These important antiinflammatory proteins prevent AKI in animal models.  In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will leverage an established ICU cohort to perform the first comprehensive, prospective study to investigate whether 25D, 1,25D, and FGF23 are independent risk factors for adverse renal outcomes among 200 critically ill patients with a high AKI event rate. Primary outcomes will include: incident AKI, assessed by serum creatinine; renal tubular injury, assessed by urinary NGAL and KIM- 1; and need for renal replacement therapy or death. In Aim 2 we will enroll 150 critically ill patients at risk of AKI into a three-arm, double-blind, randomied study of 25D, 1,25D, or placebo to test the effects of repeated doses of vitamin D metabolites on renal and immunomodulatory endpoints. We will test whether 25D and/or 1,25D attenuate incident kidney injury, assessed by time averaged levels of both serum creatinine and urinary NGAL and KIM-1. Further, we will test whether 25D and/or 1,25D increase monocyte mRNA expression of antiinflammatory targets IL-10, HO-1, HIF1a, and thrombomodulin, decrease monocyte mRNA expression of proinflammatory targets ICAM-1 and IL-6, and increase T regulatory (Treg) %, all of which attenuate kidney injury in animal models. Additionally, we will evaluate physiologic endpoints including plasma levels of FGF23 and monocyte mRNA expression of 1-a hydroxylase and 24-hydroxylase to elucidate whether peripheral conversion of 25D to 1,25D is impaired in critical illness.  By unifying a comprehensive, prospective clinical outcomes study and an innovative trial under one thematic umbrella, we will generate novel, clinically relevant insights into the emerging role of vitamin D metabolites in critical illness an AKI that could have important diagnostic and therapeutic implications.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Acute kidney injury is a devastating complication of critical illness.

I will use this Mentored Career Development award (K01) to fulfill a series of training objectives which build upon my prior skills, but also expand my expertise in ways which are essential to accomplishing my long-term goal. These include: learning to measure and analyze longitudinal stroke outcomes data; developing skills to assess, characterize, and measure white matter hyperintensity volume (WMHV) and cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans; learning about the design, conduct, and analysis of randomized clinical trials; and acquiring skills in mediation analysis techniques. To achieve my training objectives, I have assembled a comprehensive and complementary mentorship team which has worked together and with me for many years. My training objectives will also allow me to develop the skills needed to establish new datasets within ongoing studies during this award period. These subcohorts are necessary to achieve the research goals of the K01 and will provide preliminary data for future grant applications for independent research funding.  I will apply my training to several important research questions during this K01 award. Recently, there has been growing interest in the role that vitamin D as well as omega-3 fatty acids play in the development of cardiovascular disease events. Given the high morbidity burden of stroke, determining the effect of these supplements on stroke outcomes is very important. The NIH sponsored VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) is an ongoing randomized, double blind trial testing vitamin D3 and omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in the primary prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease. I will leverage this ongoing trial and collect additional data on stroke outcomes that would not otherwise be collected by the parent study. In addition, there is growing interest in discovering risk factors fr overall subclinical cerebrovascular disease burden in the brain as measured by WMHV and CMBs. Because WMHV and CMBs are associated with stroke outcomes, understanding risk factors associated with WMHV and CMBs in ischemic stroke patients may identify strategies to reduce the morbidity burden of stroke. I will collect MRI scans performed as part of routine medical care in participants with an ischemic stroke to create a database of WMHV and CMBs in VITAL and the Women's Healthy Study (WHS), a completed trial of the effects of low dose aspirin and vitamin E in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer with ongoing observational follow-up. By using data from both VITAL and WHS, I will have the unique opportunity to study how a wide variety of cardiovascular disease risk factors impact WMHV and CMBs in stroke patients.

Supplementation of vitamin D and/or omega-3 has received attention as a potential anti-aging and cardio-protective strategy. Data from in vitro and animal models suggest that these nutrients are involved in the etiology of aging or behave like a biochemical 'Fountain of Youth' to mediate healthful aging. However, enthusiasm has outpaced the scientific evidence in humans, which is currently based on observational studies and small randomized clinical trials (RCTs) often with small doses. Large clinical trials with a high dose, daily dosing regimen, adequate sample size and trial duration, and longitudinal assessment are urgently needed.  The principal function of telomeres is to protect the genome against chromosomal aberrations. Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is consistently shown to have a direct relationship with longevity, CVD and diabetes in epidemiologic studies, and is thus considered to be a biomarker of aging. What is more, LTL is relatively short in persons with chronic inflammation, which is considered to be part of CVD and diabetic risk. The on-going NIH funded VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) is a large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2 x 2 factorial trial of vitamin D3 (2,000 IU/day) and marine omega-3 fatty acid (ɯ-3 FA, 1 g/day) supplements among a representative sample of US men aged ≥50 years and women aged ≥55 years, with an oversampling of blacks. A unique feature of VITAL is the establishment of a sub-cohort of 1,054 participants who are evaluated in person at the Harvard Clinical and Translational Science Centre (CTSC) in Boston, which allows for in-clinic plasma/buffy coat sample collection and in-depth CVD phenotyping at baseline and Year 2. We propose to examine the effects of dietary vitamin D and/or             omega-3 supplementation on LTL attrition assessed longitudinally utilizing in-clinic buffy coat samples collected at baseline, Year 2, and Year 4. Thus, we will also investigate the effects of vitamin D and/or omega-3 supplementation on the longitudinal interrelationship of LTL trajectory, plasma inflammatory     cytokines, and CVD risk factors in the VITAL trial.  This proposal is in response to the information gaps/research needs identified by the most recent Institute of Medicine (IOM) Report on Dietary Reference Intakes. The IOM report identified the need for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of vitamin D for prevention of CVD, and cellular biology of vitamin D (e.g. cellular aging) as areas of high priority. The American Heart Association and the IOM recommend that all adults eat fish regularly to reduce risk for CVD. This novel and cost-effective study is expected to provide the information necessary to answer the open question of whether dietary vitamin D and/or omega-3 supplementation are beneficial for LTL shortening. Studies of telomeres will also open new avenues for the basic understanding of vitamin D and/or omega-3 as well as their preventive and therapeutic effects of CVD.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Dietary supplementation of vitamin D and/or omega-3 has received attention as a potential anti-aging and cardio-protective strategy; however, enthusiasm has outpaced the scientific evidence in humans, and evidence at the population level remains inconclusive to inform nutritional recommendations. The urgent need has prompted us to propose this present study leveraging the infrastructure of the ongoing national trial called VITAL to examine the balance of their benefits and risks. Data obtained would serve to shape evidence-based dietary vitamin D/omega intake recommendations and guidelines in elderly people.",

The results of this trial will determine whether disodium ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (Na2EDTA) chelation therapy receives approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is subsequently accepted to reduce the risk of major adverse events from coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with diabetes. TACT2, if positive, will also promote research into the mechanism(s) of benefits and provide novel insights into the pathobiology of CAD. The Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy (TACT1) was developed in response to a Request for Applications from NCCAM and the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) to address the concern that chelation use was widespread but there were no reliable data on either safety or efficacy. Surprisingly to cardiologists, the chelation strategy,  combination of up to 40 infusions with intravenous disodium EDTA plus oral multivitamins and multiminerals (OMVM) compared with intravenous and oral placebo, led to a significant reduction in the time to first recurrent cardiovascular event in patients with prior myocardial infarction (MI), age 50 or older, already treated with standard evidence based medical therapies (HR 0.74; 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.57- 0.95; p=0.016. The 5-year number needed to treat (NNT) was 12. In the prespecified subgroup with diabetes (n=633), the results were dramatic: the chelation-based strategy reduced the composite primary clinical endpoint by 51% (HR 0.49, 95%CI (0.33 0.75); p<0.001, 5-year NNT 5.5) and reduced total mortality by 43% (p=0.011, 5-year NNT 12). As a result of these findings, and because of the public health impact of cardiovascular disease and of diabetes, we have been encouraged by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the FDA to confirm the results of TACT1. The three Specific Aims of TACT2 are: 1) To determine if the chelation-based strategy in patients with diabetes and prior MI improves event-free survival; 2) To determine if the chelation-based strategy in patients with diabetes and prior MI reduces mortality; 3) To perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of the TACT2 chelation strategy. TACT2 will enroll 1200 diabetic patients 50 years of age or older with a prior MI and a serum creatinine of 2.0 mg/dL or less. Patients will be randomly allocated (1:1) to receive either chelation + OMVM or double placebo and followed for clinical events until the end of the 5 year trial.

We hypothesize that vitamin D supplementation reduces the incidence of severe asthma exacerbations in high-risk (so defined due to an exacerbation in the previous year) children aged 6 to 14 years who have vitamin D insufficiency (a serum 25(OH) D <30 ng/ml) and who are being treated with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) for mild to moderate persistent asthma. We further hypothesize that this protective effect results from a reduced incidence of viral infections that lead to severe asthma exacerbations and/or enhanced response to ICS in these children. We will test this hypothesis in a randomized double-masked placebo-controlled clinical trial with the following primary and secondary Specific Aims: Primary Specific Aim  1) To determine whether vitamin D3 supplementation (4,000 IU/day) is superior to placebo in  preventing severe asthma exacerbations in high-risk school-aged children who have vitamin D  insufficiency and who are on ICS for mild to moderate persistent asthma. Secondary Specific Aims In high-risk school-aged children with vitamin D insufficiency who are on ICS for asthma, to determine whether vitamin D3 supplementation is superior to placebo in:  1) Preventing severe asthma exacerbations resulting from viral infections  2) Reducing the daily dose of ICS as well as the average cumulative dose of ICS, at the end of the trial","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying new strategies to prevent severe asthma exacerbations would have a major impact on clinical practice and public health. This application will determine whether high-dose vitamin D supplementation should be recommended as adjuvant therapy to inhaled corticosteroids for high-risk school-aged children with mild to moderate persistent asthma and vitamin D insufficiency. To accomplish this goal, we have assembled a research team with expertise in asthma epidemiology, vitamin D and asthma, and clinical trials.",

Despite the profound public health burden, there have been no clinical trials that have attempted to directly address the neurodevelopmental deficits that are so debilitating in FASD. Extensive pre- clinical work (Thomas et al. and others) has provided evidence that choline supplementation is effective in attenuating the neurodevelopmental deficits caused by prenatal alcohol exposure in animal models. Our group has taken the initial steps toward translating this work to humans with two randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled trials. We first conducted a pilot study to ensure the feasibility, tolerability, and safety of choline supplementation in 20 children with FASD (Fuglestad et al, 2013). Next, we completed a study of 40 additional participants with the goals of establishing a target dosage for young children, testing efficacy in the domain of memory, and determining a developmental window for choline's effects (detailed in `preliminary studies').  Briefly, our pilot data revealed that: 1. Children wih FASD consume insufficient dietary choline on average; 2. Choline supplementation was safe, tolerable and feasible for 2-5 year olds; 3. Supplementation for 9 months increased children's explicit memory performance relative to placebo; 4. Significant memory improvement was seen in 2-3 year olds but not 4-5 year olds. For 2-3 year olds, memory improvement was 21 percentage points in the choline arm compared to 2 percentage points in the placebo arm; 5. A dose ranging from 10-19 mg/kg was associated with the largest improvement in memory; 6. A very common single- nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs12325817), related to endogenous choline production, appears to moderate the efficacy of choline for children with FASD.  These findings directly inform the next study. Aim 1 involves evaluating a 19 mg/kg dose in 60 children with FASD, ages 2 to 5. This dosing scheme will optimize the neurocognitive benefits and further enhance tolerability of the intervention. In addition to continuing the evaluation of memory benefits from choline, Aim 2 adds measures of attention and executive function as possible additional targets. The NIH Toolbox Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test and the Executive Function Scale for Early Childhood (pilot-tested during our last study) have been added. Aim 3 adds a longitudinal component - it will evaluate 40 children in the period two years after treatment to determine the permanency of choline's effects. Lastly, Aim 4 will further examine the role of known SNPs in choline synthesis as moderators to the observed treatment effects.  In summary, the proposed study will continue the translation of choline's application - from experimental pre-clinical work to an evidence-based intervention for neurodevelopmental deficits in children with FASD.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is known to contribute to permanent brain damage in the child, yet there are no established treatments. We completed the first two studies of choline supplementation in human children: a feasibility study and a pilot efficacy study. The proposed study will continue that work, determining whether choline supplementation during a specific developmental window when the child's brain remains somewhat plastic is able to attenuate the deficits in thinking, memory, processing speed, and behavior that are common in children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and whether these changes are long- lasting.",

It is predictive of breast cancer risk for at least 10 years in the futue and has been suggested as a surrogate marker of breast cancer risk. Several states now mandate release of mammographic density data to women. However, except for anti-hormonal therapies (e.g., tamoxifen), no interventions have been proven to reduce breast density. Thus, testing promising, well-tolerated interventions that might affect mammographic density is of substantial interest. Several lines of evidence suggest that vitamin D may play a role in breast density and breast carcinogenesis. Vitamin D reduces proliferation and promotes differentiation and apoptosis in breast cells in culture. However, no large-scale randomized studies have examined the impact of vitamin D on mammographic density. We propose to examine the randomized effects vitamin D3 on mammographic breast density in the NIH sponsored VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL), an ongoing randomized, double blind, trial testing vitamin D3 (2,000 IU/day cholecalciferol) and omega-3 fatty acids (840 mg eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA]+ docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) in the primary prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease in a multi-ethnic population of over 24,000 men and women. In this ancillary sub study, mammograms will be obtained on 4000 women age 55-67 years (25% African-American), from baseline (pre-randomization) and after 1 and 4 years of randomized therapy. Centrally processed quantitative mammographic density and texture variation will be measured. We will determine if randomized vitamin D treatment is associated with change in mammographic features, and whether effects are modified by baseline mammographic density, and baseline 25(OH) vitamin D levels. In addition, tissue samples from women in VITAL undergoing breast biopsy/surgery, for both nonmalignant and malignant conditions, will be collected. Quantitative morphological measures, as well as gene expression assays targeting vitamin D activation and breast carcinogenesis pathways, will be performed on collected tissues among women on randomized vitamin D3 compared with placebo. This ancillary study provides a timely opportunity to test comprehensively the effects of vitamin D3 on mammographic features and breast tissue biology in a randomized setting at minimal additional cost.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Thus far, only hormonal therapies such as tamoxifen have been shown to reduce breast density, and these are associated with a high side effect burden. We propose to examine the randomized effects of vitamin D on mammographic breast density and texture in the ongoing, already-funded VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) study. We will collect baseline (pre-randomization), 1-year and 4-year follow-up mammograms, as well as tissue specimens from women undergoing breast biopsy/surgery for malignant and nonmalignant disease, to further elucidate the role of vitamin D on mammographic features and breast tissue biology. Identifying well-tolerated, promising nutritional agents that could reduce breast density would have important public health implications for women at high risk of breast cancer.",

In the first funding period (9/29/10-06/30/15), we completed baseline and early follow- up of depression outcomes among nearly 19,000 successfully randomized men and women, aged 50+ years (mean age=65y), who were eligible for incidence or recurrence of late-life depression; nearly 70% of participants have provided pre-randomization blood samples for nutrient biochemical assays. Furthermore, in the Clinical and Translational Science Center (CTSC) component, detailed phenotypic assessments were conducted among a subset of over 1,000 individuals who received in-person structured psychiatric diagnostic interviews, underwent neuropsychological testing, and provided data on dimensional measures of mood, well- being, and social and daily functioning. Finally, another landmark aspect of VITAL-DEP is its substantial racial and ethnic diversity: over 25% of participants are from minority racial and/or ethnic backgrounds, including 19% who are African American. Indeed, our first funding period aims emphasized potential differences in vitamin D response among African Americans, given high risk of low 25(OH)D in this group. However, late- breaking evidence indicates that bioavailable vitamin D is of greatest relevance to race/ethnic differences. In this 5-year renewal proposal, we expand upon what has been achieved in the first period - assembly of a unique trial cohort - and focus on the unprecedented scientific opportunities afforded by this RCT design. Our Primary Aims are: 1) to extend follow-up of mood to examine with high statistical power the long-term (up to 7 years) effects of vitamin D and marine omega-3 fatty acids on depression outcomes among all ~19,000 participants; 2) to examine with high power the impact of biochemical nutrients levels of vitamin D and omega- 3 fatty acids on depression outcomes as well as treatment interaction with baseline biochemical levels. Secondary Aims focus on two critical themes that our particular trial design is uniquely poised to address: 1) racial/ethnic differences in long-term treatment effects; 2) mechanisms, mediators and moderators of mood effects of vitamin D and fish oil in this diverse cohort. Specifically, in a sub-set of 2,000 participants, we will examine relations of bioavailable vitamin D to depression, with attention to race differences in outcomes. Further, among the entire eligible CTSC cohort, we will obtain pre- and post-randomization serum brain- derived neurotrophic factor and targeted plasma metabolite levels to examine biological paths involved in mood responses to vitamin D and fish oil treatment and to test whether biomarker change explains variation in treatment effects. Thus, this proposal not only will ensure comprehensive, definitive testing of the benefits of vitamin D and fish oil for late-life mood but also will inform specific mechanisms involved in a diverse sample.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Biologic and observational evidence supports potential mental health benefits of both vitamin D and marine omega-3 fatty acids. However, it remains unclear whether the use of these supplements can prevent depression or can significantly reduce depressive symptoms in late-life. This ongoing randomized trial, conducted among approximately 19,000 U.S. men and women, respectively aged =50 years =55 years, will: 1) clarify the effects of long-term daily vitamin D and/or omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on late-life depressive symptoms and 2) inform how these agents work to impact mood and for whom.",

In the US, close to 48 million people contract AGE and 128,000 are hospitalized each year . Episodes of AGE can result in substantial morbidity to children and their families. In addition, the costs to caregivers, the health-care system, and society are significant. At present, treatment options are limited and targeted at symptom management rather than disease modification. Probiotics - live microbial cultures which, when consumed in adequate amounts, confer documented health benefits - may be an ideal solution. They are hypothesized to work via a combination of direct microbiologic and immunologic mechanisms. Probiotics have shown promise in early clinical research in hospitalized children in developing countries. These early efforts are limited by small samples, outcomes lacking relevance to outpatients, poor methodology and absence of side effect reporting; thus, the potential role of probiotics remains poorly defined and practice guidelines do not endorse their use. There are current trends, however, that obligate an urgent assessment of these agents. First, probiotic manufacturers have embarked in aggressive public marketing strategies that make health claims that may not be supported by rigorous research, and the world-wide market for probiotic products is growing steadily (projected growth 2009-2014 12.6% for a total of US $32.6 billion/year). Second, government agencies (US FDA and European Food safety Authority (EFSA)) remain concerned about their value and safety. Third, some institutions are now recommending the use of probiotics based on potentially flawed or limited evidence. Fourth, parents of patients with AGE are often medicating their children without guidance from medical professionals. We are therefore concerned that probiotic consumption is increasing without solid evidence to support its use, which underscores the necessity to conduct a definitive trial without delay. Objectives - The overall objective of this multi-national randomized clinical trial is to determine if a specific probiotic agent, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG(LGG), the most widely available, studied and regulated probiotic in the US, should routinely be administered to outpatient children who are suffering from AGE. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) to determine the clinical effectiveness of LGG and (2) to determine the safety and side effect profile of LGG in children 3-48 months of age presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with AGE. Study Setting & Design - The study will be conducted in 8 US pediatric emergency departments within the federally funded Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN). We will randomize 900 children to receive 5 days of a probiotic agent (LGG 1 x 1010 CFU twice a day) or placebo. The main outcome is the occurrence of moderate-severe disease as defined by the Modified Vesikari Score, a validated clinical severity score, which incorporates the frequency and duration of diarrhea, frequency and duration of vomiting, height of fever, need for future health-care visits and medical interventions provided. We will also assess the occurrence of adverse events and side effects related to the use of LGG. We will collect stool samples to conduct mechanism of action studies as well as economic data to conduct cost effectiveness analyses in the future. Impact - This study will directly inform clinica practice by providing the first definitive evidence to support recommendations for or against the routine use of probiotics in the treatment of pediatric AGE. In addition it will provide health-car practitioners and policy makers with (a) a clear picture on the potential side effects from probiotic use, and with the data collected (b) knowledge on the mechanism of action and (c) of the potential economic impact of probiotic use on health-care systems and society. Thus, the potential clinical and societal impacts of the proposed study are substantial and the results will guide the standard of care: if positive, guidelines will be able to endorse probiotic administratio with important positive consequences for the health of several million US children annually. Moreover, if beneficial the cost savings to the health-care system and society may be substantial. If the results are negative, a firm recommendation against the routine use of probiotics would be justified. Collaborators - This work is collaboration between leaders in multicenter and AGE research (Schnadower, Freedman, Tarr, Gorelick, Mahajan, Stanley, Roskind, Powell, O'Connel, Ruddy Chun, Levine and Casper) in prestigious Children's Hospitals within a federally funded multicenter network (PECARN) with a strong record in conducting high quality, high impact clinical trials.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Gastroenteritis, or intestinal infection, which usually manifests as vomiting and diarrhea, is one of the most common illnesses of childhood. It causes over 1.7 million deaths per year worldwide. In the United States, it is rarely fatal, however it results in .4 million doctor visits and 128,000 hospitalizations per year and constitutes a significant burden for patients, their families and society. Currently, available treatments for this condition are aimed only at the symptoms and complications (e.g. dehydration) and not at modifying the disease process. We propose to study the effectiveness and side effects of a probiotic, LGG, in treating children with gastroenteritis. If successful, this therapeutic intervention would be the frst treatment that actually changes the disease process and would represent an enormous public health advance both in the US, and potentially, globally.",

Most asthma is diagnosed before the age of six years and is preceded by episodes of troublesome lung symptoms – wheezing, in the years after birth. Asthma is a complex disease with both genetic and environmental exposures contributing to its development: ORMDL3 and FADS are well-replicated asthma genes while vitamin D2-5 and n-3 polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs)6 have recently been identified as important prenatal risk factors for asthma. Despite the identification of these risk factors, a complete mechanistic understanding of how these exposures and genes operate together to impact asthma development remains unknown. Metabolomic profiling has the distinct advantage of being a marker that reflects the cumulative sum of past and current environmental and genetic exposures leading to the disease. Our preliminary metabolomics work has successfully identified associations between prenatal exposures (Vitamin D, n-3 PUFAs), asthma genes (ORMDL3 and FADS), and metabolites, thereby providing a direct mechanistic connection of how these risk variants may operate together to influence disease development. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that the sphingolipid and eicosanoid pathways are important in asthma pathogenesis and may enlighten the mechanisms through which asthma genes (e.g. ORMDL3, FADS) and prenatal early life exposures (vitamin D and n-3 PUFAs) operate to cause or prevent asthma. For this proposal, we will capitalize on two randomized clinical trials with analogous study design and follow-up strategies – Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART) and Copenhagen Studies on Asthma in Childhood (COPSAC2010). Together these studies showed that prenatal vitamin D and n-3 PUFAs in supplementation reduce the risk of persistent wheeze/asthma in the first 3 years of life by 23% (p<0.01) and 32%6 (p=0.035) respectively. In this proposal we will: 1) Assess the effect of the maternal metabolome and prenatal exposures on the child metabolome; 2) Study the relationship between metabolites in the sphingolipid pathway, the ORMDL3 risk variant, and prenatal vitamin D supplementation on asthma risk; 3) Study the relationship between pro- and anti-inflammatory eicosanoids, genetic variants in FADS, and prenatal n-3 PUFA supplementation on asthma risk. Findings from this important study will have great public health importance in elucidating mechanisms involved in the development of asthma in children and could lead to preventive strategies against asthma in childhood.","PROJECT NARRATIVE Being the most common health-related cause of lost school and work days, asthma has a large public health impact. We study potential mechanisms for asthma development in two biological pathways where we believe asthma genes and prenatal vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid supplementation operate to alter asthma risk. We will use 1,218 mother/child pairs from two randomized controlled trial birth cohorts that have data rich in prenatal exposures, clinical measures, metabolomics, and genetics.",

The proposed research project will study children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), 4-15 years of age, who are complaining of recurring gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, such as abdominal pain, constipation, and vomiting. These gastrointestinal problems are often associated with abnormal behavior, such as irritability. Our group is planning to test if at two different doses of a probiotic (defined as a bacterial product which when consumed in adequate quantity improves health) can benefit these children with GI symptoms. Oral doses of the probiotic we have selected (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium lactis BB-12, BB-12+LGG) to be tested are: a straw with 2 billion colony forming units (CFUs), a straw with 10 billion CFUs, and a placebo straw. We plan to enroll 70 eligible subjects with confirmed ASD and randomize them to placebo, low dose, and high dose of BB-12+LGG once daily at 1:2:2 ratio. The probiotic, to be added to food, may improve abdominal complaints which we hypothesize may produce changes in autistic behaviors that accompany these GI symptoms. Even though probiotics are widely available, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires that we demonstrate that this particular combination probiotic is safe in children before we can undertake a large multi-center trial to see if BB-12+LGG is effective at different doses in children with ASD. Based on previous trials in adults and adolescents, we expect no serious side effects from the use of BB-12+LGG. There will be 4 visits over 90 days. We expect to see a trend toward improvement of autistic behavior and GI symptoms by the end of the 56 days of treatment with BB-12+LGG at the highest dose. The pain and abnormal behaviors will be recorded using validated questionnaires. This study incorporates an Integrated Omics approach. Several blood and stool tests will be tested as potentially useful biomarkers of intestinal health in ASD, including a test of gut permeability (zonulin), a blood test for systemic inflammation (S100A9), and a stool test for inflammation (calprotectin). We will concomitantly measure bacterial communities in the stool (using 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing) and we will measure key metabolites in the blood and stool that have been proposed to contribute to GI symptoms in children with ASD (using high performance liquid chromatography).

These gastrointestinal problems are often associated with abnormal behavior, such as irritability. Our group is planning to test if at two different doses of a probiotic (defined as a bacterial product which when consumed in adequate quantity improves health) can benefit these children with GI symptoms. Oral doses of the probiotic we have selected (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium lactis BB-12, BB-12+LGG) to be tested are: a straw with 2 billion colony forming units (CFUs), a straw with 10 billion CFUs, and a placebo straw. We plan to enroll 70 eligible subjects with confirmed ASD and randomize them to placebo, low dose, and high dose of BB-12+LGG once daily at 1:2:2 ratio. The probiotic, to be added to food, may improve abdominal complaints which we hypothesize may produce changes in autistic behaviors that accompany these GI symptoms. Even though probiotics are widely available, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires that we demonstrate that this particular combination probiotic is safe in children before we can undertake a large multi-center trial to see if BB-12+LGG is effective at different doses in children with ASD. Based on previous trials in adults and adolescents, we expect no serious side effects from the use of BB-12+LGG. There will be 4 visits over 90 days. We expect to see a trend toward improvement of autistic behavior and GI symptoms by the end of the 56 days of treatment with BB-12+LGG at the highest dose. The pain and abnormal behaviors will be recorded using validated questionnaires. This study incorporates an Integrated Omics approach. Several blood and stool tests will be tested as potentially useful biomarkers of intestinal health in ASD, including a test of gut permeability (zonulin), a blood test for systemic inflammation (S100A9), and a stool test for inflammation (calprotectin). We will concomitantly measure bacterial communities in the stool (using 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing) and we will measure key metabolites in the blood and stool that have been proposed to contribute to GI symptoms in children with ASD (using high performance liquid chromatography). If an optimal dose of BB-12 + LGG is found to be safe and shows a signal toward improvement with respect to GI or autistic symptoms, we plan to study this probiotic in a larger, multi-center trial, using adaptive trial design.","Project Narrative/Public Health Relevance Statement Road to discovery for Bifidobacterium lactis BB-12+Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (BB-12+LGG) in treating autism spectrum disorders Almost half of the children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have abdominal symptoms, including crampy pain, constipation, and vomiting--symptoms which resemble irritable bowel syndrome, respond poorly to medicines, and affect their behavior and quality of life. In an investigator-blinded trial, we will administer to children with ASD and abdominal symptoms a combination of two active probiotic cultures (BB-12+LGG), assigned randomly by a computer program to one of two different doses and given by a straw or to a placebo straw with an equal amount of an inactive sugar. If either one of the doses of BB-12+LGG is found to be safe and promising with respect to gastrointestinal health and/or autistic-type behavior, we will use our findings plan a future multicenter trial to determine if this probiotic will be a new and safer treatment for children with ASD and gastrointestinal problems.",

Osteoporosis and fractures are major health problems in the U.S. with annual expenditures of $19 billion, and the problem is growing. Our goal is to provide nurses and the wider healthcare community best practice guidelines by contributing evidence as to whether a lifestyle intervention should be implemented for women with low bone mass prior to use of bisphosphonate (BP) medications. In this study, women with low bone mass in the first 5 years of menopause (a time of rapid and significant bone loss) will be randomized to 3 groups (n =103 per group): 1) optimal calcium + vitamin D (optimal CaD) alone (Control); 2) a BP plus optimal CaD (Risedronate); or 3) a three times weekly bone loading exercise program plus optimal CaD (Exercise). Adequate calcium and vitamin D are necessary for bone; however, they frequently are not enough to prevent progression of bone loss in post-menopausal women. Although BPs are indicated for women with osteoporosis, their use is controversial for women with early bone loss. One concern is that long-term use of BPs may increase risk for atypical hip and femur fractures. A bone loading exercise program promotes bone health by improving bone structure and bone formation at sites of mechanical stress as well as by preserving BMD. Comparing effectiveness of exercises with BPs is critical because this will determine whether standard practice should include a trial of exercises prior to BP prescriptions in this at risk population. If an effective exercise program could substitute for, or delay the use of BPs, not only would bone health improve throughout the lifespan, but women would benefit from the many other positive effects of exercise. Our central hypothesis is that after 12 months of participation, improvements in bone strength will be greater in subjects randomized to the Exercise group compared to subjects in either the Control or Risedronate groups. We believe that the best predictor of fracture is bone strength, and strength is determined by bone structure and turnover as well as BMD. Thus, outcomes will include changes in bone structure at the tibia and hip (pQCT and Hip Structural Analysis); BMD at the total hip, femoral neck, and spine; and serum markers of bone formation and resorption. Because adherence to exercises and risedronate may be difficult for subjects to accomplish, education, goal setting, graphic feedback, and targeted strategies for barrier reduction will be used to promote adherence. Dr. Nancy Waltman has over 15 years' experience and 14 publications on the impact of exercise on bone in post-menopausal women. With the addition of Dr. Bilek and other expert consultants and co-investigators, we believe we are well-qualified to conduct this study. Our proposal is consistent with the NINR strategic plan to support research for patient self-management, disease prevention, & application of new technology (Hip Structural Analysis and pQCT).","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Osteoporosis and fractures are major health care problems in postmenopausal women. To prevent fractures and strengthen bones, treatments for low bone mass should improve bone structure and increase bone formation at common sites of fractures as well as maintaining bone mineral density. This study will compare changes in bone strength (bone structure, formation, and bone mineral density) at the hip and spine in women who take 12 months of either: 1) optimal calcium and vitamin D alone; 2) the bisphosphonate 'risedronate' with calcium and vitamin D; or 3) a bone-loading exercise program with calcium and vitamin D.",

Lower intensity and better-tolerated, cost-effective treatment strategies are needed for these patients. Low vitamin D levels at diagnosis of indolent lymphomas are strongly associated with inferior outcomes to treatment. Standard therapy for low tumor burden, indolent lymphoma includes a single agent monoclonal antibody (rituximab). In this proposal, we will complete a double-blind, placebo- controlled randomized trial evaluating if vitamin D supplementation with 2000IU oral tablets daily for three years improves the progression-free survival of patients with indolent lymphoma treated with single agent rituximab. Stratification factors for randomization will include histology and FL-IPI prognostic score. The primary endpoint of the trial is progression-free survival over three years; secondary endpoints include response at 13 weeks, and overall survival. Planned subset analyses include follicular lymphoma histology and female sex. With 210 randomized patients, we will have 80% power to detect a HR = 0.55 at a two sided alpha = 0.05 level of significance. This clinical trial will be coordinated at the University of Rochester Wilmot Cancer Institute, and six expert lymphoma centers from the Lymphoma Epidemiology of Outcomes (LEO) Consortium will participate. We will leverage this LEO consortium for tumor banking and prospective patient-reported outcomes of enrolled patients. We will also identify if baseline and/or restaging serum vitamin D levels predict subgroups of patients for whom Vitamin D supplementation is particularly effective or particularly ineffective. Finally, since there is evidence to suggest that response to oral vitamin D supplementation may be dependent upon specific genotypes of the Vitamin D receptor (VDR) and vitamin D binding protein (DPB), we will utilize whole exome sequencing to determine whether vitamin D-related germline variations are critical determinants of outcome in the context of vitamin D supplementation of patients with indolent lymphoma. Our aims the defining threshold levels of vitamin D where supplementation is most effective and the impact of germline polymorphisms on outcome will inform future trial designs and contribute to mechanistic understanding. Demonstrating a benefit to vitamin D supplementation in this randomized trial would rapidly change standard of care in the most common presentation of indolent lymphoma, and provide a low-risk, well-tolerated, inexpensive option delaying the time to morbid treatments.","PROJECT NARRATIVE Several studies suggest Vitamin D deficiency is correlated with inferior outcome after treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In this proposal, we will conduct a randomized clinical trial (ILyAD: Indolent lymphoma and vitamin D) comparing standard rituximab therapy with vitamin D supplementation to standard rituximab therapy and placebo in patients with low tumor burden indolent lymphoma. We will also explore predictors of response to vitamin D supplementation within this clinical study.",

Kidney failure is a frequent complication of sepsis and septic shock that is associated with worse outcomes. To date, the understanding of kidney injury in sepsis and septic shock has traditionally focused on decreased blood pressure leading to kidney hypoperfusion. Recent studies have challenged this paradigm, however, illustrating that sepsis associated kidney injury often occurs even when perfusion is adequate. These findings suggest that alternative pathophysiologic mechanisms may have a role in sepsis related kidney injury. The mechanisms remain poorly understood and as yet there are no proven interventions aimed at mitigating sepsis-induced kidney injury. Thiamine (vitamin B1), a key cofactor of pyruvate dehydrogenase, is a critical component of oxidative phosphorylation (i.e. aerobic mitochondrial respiration). In the absence of thiamine, mitochondrial metabolism shifts towards anaerobic energy production, which is inefficient and results in lactate production. Thiamine deficiency has also been linked to increased levels of reactive oxygen species. Our research group has previously demonstrated that thiamine deficiency is common in critical illness and inversely associated with lactate levels. We hypothesize that thiamine deficiency during critical illness may occur due to increased metabolic demand which rapidly consumes available thiamine stores. In a randomized trial, our research group has found that the administration of thiamine to thiamine deficient patients with septic shock leads to reduced lactate at 24-hours. In a post-hoc analysis of that study, my work has shown that patients (including both thiamine replete and thiamine deficient patients) who received thiamine had lower creatinine values at 24-hours and were less likely to require kidney replacement therapy (e.g. dialysis). Our research group has also shown improved cellular oxygen consumption in septic patients and cardiac surgery patients who receive thiamine. Given the above, we hypothesize that thiamine attenuates kidney injury during septic shock by supporting aerobic mitochondrial metabolism. To test this hypothesis, we have planned a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial of thiamine to improve in kidney function in patients with septic shock. This award will allow me to further develop as a physician-investigator and to test important hypotheses with potentially significant therapeutic benefits for patients with sepsis and septic shock.","Project Narrative Septic shock is a common and highly lethal condition. Our research group has previously found evidence that thiamine, a B vitamin, may prevent kidney injury during septic shock. To test this hypothesis, we propose a randomized, controlled clinical trial of thiamine for kidney protection in patients with septic shock.",

Vaginal and gastrointestinal (GI) colonization with GBS occurs in up to 30% of adult women, with highest rates in African Americans. Pregnant women can pass GBS to their fetuses during vaginal birth, putting them at risk for Early Onset Group B Streptococcus Disease (EOGBSD), which is associated with a neonatal mortality rate of 5-10% and morbidity of approximately 50%. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2010 guidelines require universal antepartum GBS screening by vaginal to rectal cultures of all women at 35-37 weeks gestation, and intravenously administered intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) of two or more doses if a woman is found to be colonized with GBS. While use of these guidelines has significantly reduced EOGBSD incidence from 1.7 per 1,000 live births to 0.34-0.37, up to 30% of laboring women and their fetuses are exposed to IAP. Complications associated with IAP are significant for both the mother (increased incidence of antibiotic resistance, allergic sensitization, diarrhea including Clostridium difficile, and fungal infections) and neonate (gut dysbiosis, opportunistic infections, and allergic risk). The proposed study will test a low-cost, safe, innovative approach to reduce prenatal colonization with GBS, while adhering to CDC guidelines for EOGBSD prevention. We hypothesize that women who ingest a commercially available oral probiotic combination product (Florajen3, containing Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium lactis, and Bifidobacterium longum) daily from 28 weeks gestation through the time of labor will have a lower risk of GBS colonization compared to women taking placebo. The purpose of this Phase 2 placebo-controlled, double blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to determine the efficacy of once daily ingestion of Florajen3 by healthy low-risk pregnant women from 28 weeks gestation until the time of labor to (a) reduce the proportion of women with GBS colonization and thus (b) reduce the number of women who receive IAP. We expect this intervention to alter the vaginal and rectal microbiota by (c) increasing Lactobacillus colony counts, (d) decreasing GBS colony counts, and (e) reducing GI symptoms. In preparation for this RCT, the research team has conducted two preliminary studies (one in vitro, one in vivo), an integrative review of the literature regarding the use of prenatal probiotics, and a systematic review on probiotics and urogynecologic infections. The literature and preliminary work support the safety, tolerability, and potentially high impact of the oral probiotic as an innovative, low-risk, easy-to-use intervention to reduce GBS colonization during pregnancy and significantly reduce exposure of mothers and infants to IAP and the associated complications. If positive, findings from this study will shift the paradigm in clinical practice and be used to design and conduct a larger RCT to extend the science of nursing, midwifery, obstetrics, microbiology, clinical nutrition, and infectious disease for care of pregnant women and their infants.","Project Narrative The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2010 Guidelines to prevent early onset neonatal Group B Streptococcus (GBS) disease (EOGBSD) require a maternal GBS culture at 35-37 weeks gestation, followed by intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) for up to 30% of women who test positive for this organism. Currently, there are no strategies to reduce the incidence of GBS colonization in pregnant women. If the hypotheses of this study are supported, oral probiotic therapy could provide an effective approach to increase Lactobacillus colony counts, thereby reducing GBS colonization and colony counts during pregnancy, and decreasing maternal-fetal exposure to IAP and its associated complications.",

One of the most prominent has been the link between gut microbial metabolism of trimethylamine (TMA) moieties from dietary sources (choline, phosphatidylcholine, L-carnitine, etc.) and CVD. Gut microbes metabolize dietary choline to release TMA via the action of cutC TMA lyase. TMA is absorbed and then oxidized by hepatic flavin monooxygenases (FMO3) to form trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). TMAO has been causally linked to atherothrombotic disease in animal models and is predictive of CVD risk in cohort studies. The overall objectives of this R21 proposal are to: 1) determine the feasibility and establish proof-of-concept for the effects of choline bitartrate supplementation on circulating TMAO and endothelial-dependent dilation in middle-aged adults in order to conduct a larger, more comprehensive trial in the future; 2) establish our proficiency in measuring gut microbiota composition and function; and 3) obtain preliminary data for effect size generation. To this end, following a two-week lead-in diet, we will randomize twenty-four middle-aged adults (45-65 yrs) to 4-weeks of choline bitartrate (1000 mg/d) or placebo. Subjects will be provided all of their food with choline and TMA-moiety intake maintained at meal levels intake of the US diet for the duration of the study from our metabolic kitchen to avoid potential confounding through differences in habitual dietary intake of TMA moieties between individuals. Measurements of TMAO concentration by UPLC-MS/MS, flow-mediated dilation using high resolution ultrasound, and gut microbiota composition/function using 16S rRNA pyrosequencing and targeted qt-PCR, respectively will be made before and following each 4-week treatment period. This innovative integrative and translational physiological study will be conducted by an established P.I. and investigative team with extensive experience and a strong record of success performing intervention studies targeting cardiometabolic dysfunction. These studies have significant translational potential as they may advance basic science findings in rodents to humans and provide novel mechanistic insight into observational studies in humans by establishing the effect of dietary choline on endothelial function through its interaction with the host intestinal microbiota. In turn, the gut microbiota may be a key target for therapies that may contribute to the maintenance of a healthy endothelium or treatment of endothelial dysfunction. Importantly, our study also will provide insight into the gut microbiota as important source of inter-individual variability in the increase in TMAO and flow-mediated dilation responses to dietary choline intake. As such, the latter may provide rationale for individualizing nutritional or other interventions that target the gut microbiota as an interface between the food we eat and host physiology (i.e., endothelial function).","Project Narrative Distinct gut bacteria release trimethylamine (TMA) from dietary substrates such as choline. TMA is enters the circulation and is subsequently oxidized in the liver to produce trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). TMAO is predictive of cardiovascular disease risk in cohort studies but whether TMAO contributes to endothelial dysfunction, a key player in the initiation and progression of atherothrombotic disease in humans is unclear. The purpose of the present study is to determine if choline bitartrate supplementation, which increases plasma TMAO concentration, impairs endothelial function in middle- aged adults, a group who are vulnerable to vascular insults from risk factors.",

Adequate nutritional status in CF, including maintenance of skeletal muscle (fat-free) mass, is tightly correlated with lung function and survival in this population. However, relatively little research exists to guide evidence- based optimal dietary recommendations regarding specific nutrients and food patterns in CF. Recent advances in high-resolution metabolomics (HRM) provide a unique opportunity to broadly explore metabolism and underlying pathways relevant to nutrition, disease exacerbation, and treatment in CF. Preliminary HRM data from Dr. Alvarez's K01-supported research (K01 DK102851) indicated an enhanced catabolic state in adults with CF, as evidenced by dysregulation of plasma amino acids and lipids and their metabolic intermediates. The data also suggested that high-dose vitamin D3--previously shown to improve clinical outcomes--may mitigate catabolism in these subjects during an acute pulmonary exacerbation. Furthermore, key clinical outcomes before vitamin D3 intervention, such as lung function, were correlated with metabolic pathways directly linked to dietary intake and nutritional status. The purpose of this R03 study is to use plasma HRM with advanced bioinformatics to: 1) identify specific nutrient-related metabolic processes that differ as a function of clinical status and are linked to important clinical outcomes; and 2) confirm an anti-catabolic/pro-anabolic effect of high-dose vitamin D3 in a completed prospective, randomized controlled trial. The overall goal of this project is to obtain new insight into the CF catabolic state during acute illness and recovery that will inform the design of future nutritional interventions to prevent depletion of fat-free mass. Specific aims are to use plasma HRM to: 1) compare the catabolic state of adults with CF during clinical stability vs. during acute pulmonary exacerbation, using healthy adults and adults with non-CF bronchiectasis as controls; 2) investigate whether high-dose vitamin D3 has long-term anti-catabolic/pro-anabolic effects in adults with CF initially hospitalized for an acute pulmonary exacerbation; and 3) conduct metabolome-wide association studies in Aim 1 and 2 CF subjects to determine if nutrient-related pathways are linked to convalescence and clinical outcomes over time. This R03 grant, in combination with Dr. Alvarez's K01 training, will accelerate her transition to independence and will provide strong preliminary data for subsequent R01 studies. These will focus on the pathophysiology of catabolism in CF and development of new nutritional strategies to improve the health and quality of life in adults with CF, consistent with the mission of the NIDDK.","PROJECT NARRATIVE Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-shortening genetic disease adversely affecting the digestive, lung, and other body systems.

Despite over 40 years of research on AH, there is still no FDA approved treatment for this disease. The most commonly used off-label drugs for AH are corticosteroids and pentoxifylline. Unfortunately, even patients with AH treated with corticosteroids have a 6 month mortality of 40%. These poor clinical outcomes are due, in large part, to an incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of alcohol-mediated liver injury. Therefore, there is an urgent need for effective new therapies for this pernicious disease. This multicenter study will be a collaborative effort of four medical centers (Cleveland Clinic, University of Louisville, UT Southwestern, and University of Massachusetts) with its ultimate goal of transforming the clinical treatment of AH by rapidly translating novel and innovative basic science discoveries into clinical practice. In the first 2.5 years of the grant, two clinical trials will test the hypohesis that disruption of the normal gut-barrier function, over-activation of the inflammatory cascade, and innate immune activation are the primary elements of the complex pathogenesis of AH. In patients with severe AH, the first trial will compare a novel drug combination of anakinra (an inhibitor of IL-1 activity), pentoxifylline (a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that suppresses the inflammatory cytokine cascade), and zinc (which improves gut-barrier function) with the current standard of care therapy of treatment with corticosteroids. The second trial will compare probiotics (to improve gut-barrier function) to placebo in patients with moderate AH. The primary outcomes of both clinical trials will be 6 month mortality. Both trials will also supply specimens o the translational/basic science components of this UO1 consortium to identify novel biomarkers and altered pharmacogenetics that predict disease severity and response to pharmacologic therapy as well as to identify unique drug targets for novel treatments for AH.

In the first cycle of this award, we leveraged an innovative nationwide NIH-funded double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial, VITAL, to test the effects of vitamin D (vitamin D3 [cholecalciferol]) and marine omega-3 fatty acid (eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] + docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) supplements upon the risk of incident autoimmune disease and changes in biomarkers of systemic inflammation. Data from laboratory studies, observational epidemiologic research, and small prevention trials strongly suggest that these nutritional agents have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating benefits. Popular enthusiasm for vitamin D and fish oil supplements underscores the urgent need for rigorous testing. We have recruited, randomized, and are following 25,874 VITAL participants, men aged ≥50 and women aged ≥55 nationwide, including 20% African Americans. Following a 3 month run-in, eligible participants were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: vitamin D3 (2000 IU/d) and fish oil (EPA+DHA, 1 g/d); vitamin D3 and fish oil placebo; placebo vitamin D3 and fish oil; and placebo vitamin D3 and placebo fish oil. At yearly intervals, all participants receive a new pill supply, are asked about compliance and side effects, and report incident autoimmune diseases. A physician endpoints committee has confirmed 444 incident autoimmune disease cases by medical record review to date. In a randomly selected subcohort of 1634 VITAL participants, blood samples have been assayed for changes in C-reactive peptide, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor- receptor 2 in all four trial arms. With this renewal grant, we will complete the 5 pre-specified years and a 2 year observational extension, critically important given the long latency of autoimmune disease onset. Continued follow-up will improve statistical power for detecting preventive effects on autoimmune disease incidence, and will enable investigations of effects over time and effect modification by baseline factors and biomarkers. We hypothesize that there will be a delayed reduction in autoimmune disease, and that the largest preventive effects will be among those with high systemic inflammation, including the obese and those with elevated baseline biomarkers of inflammation. In this renewal, we also will test for changes in “Specialized Pro- Resolving Mediators” (SPM), novel omega-3 fatty acid-dependent lipids responsible for inflammation resolution. We will employ cutting-edge quantitative liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy to extend understanding of the biological mechanisms by which omega-3 fatty acids influence inflammation resolution and potentially autoimmune disease pathogenesis.

Pregnant AN women from Alaska`s Yukon Kuskokwim (YK) Delta have increased  rates of vitamin D deficiency associated with transition from a traditional marine diet. Alaska Native  children from the YK Delta experience one of the highest reported rates of early childhood caries (ECC). A  Canadian study showed an association between low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels in prenatal  women and ECC in their infants. We evaluated the association between YK Delta prenatal 25(OH)D  levels and ECC in their children using data from the 'Maternal Organics Monitoring (MOM) Study”, and  children's electronic dental records to assess ECC by decayed missing and filled teeth (dmft) scores. In  the analysis, children 24-35 months of age with cord blood 25(OH)D <12 ng/ml had a mean dmft score 2.4  times higher than non-deficient” children (p=0.003). There is limited information on the impact of prenatal  supplementation improving vitamin D concentrations in pregnant women and no information on the impact  on ECC.

Therefore, the current American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists  recommends only the 400 IU of vitamin D in prenatal vitamins. Data in YK Delta women from the MOM  study (2000-2010) showed 91% of 25(OH)D cord blood levels were <20ng/ml (insufficient), and 53% were  <12ng/ml (deficient). In Fall 2015, YK Delta Regional Hospital (YKDRH) evaluated 25(OH)D in prenatal  women – 60% were insufficient (<20ng/ml). In Fall 2016 YKDRH implemented guidelines to add 1000 IU  of daily vitamin D to routinely recommended prenatal vitamins (400 IU) and calcium (200 IU). The recent  Vitamin D supplementation guidelines in YK Delta offers an opportunity to evaluate the impact of prenatal  supplementation on 25(OH)D concentrations and ECC. We propose a cohort study using the electronic  health records and dental records to evaluate: 1) the effectiveness of prenatal vitamin D supplementation  in increasing 25(OH)D concentrations to sufficient levels, 2) the association between deficient prenatal  (25(OH)D concentrations and ECC, and 3) the impact of prenatal vitamin D supplementation on ECC. We  will test the difference in 25(OH)D levels at first prenatal visit and third trimester in women before and after  enhanced vitamin D supplementation, and measure factors associated with compliance. We will evaluate  mean dmft scores between non-deficient and deficient Vitamin D groups, and before and after  supplementation. and explore the relationship of covariates. This Information will help clinicians make  decisions about prenatal vitamin D supplementation in YK Delta and other high risk populations.","No data",

UUI symptoms overlap with symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI), the most common infection in older adults and UUI is associated with an increased risk of UTI in both men and women. Overall success with current UUI treatment modalities remains poor and short-term. Vitamin D supplementation is a plausible intervention for UUI and UTI prevention, but few studies have examined associations between vitamin D levels and UUI and UTI. Vitamin D may influence detrusor muscle contraction by activating vitamin D receptors present in detrusor muscle and blocking the RhoA/Rho-associated kinase, a calcium-independent pathway for smooth muscle contraction. Vitamin D also stimulates production of antimicrobial peptides, which inhibit growth of bladder bacteria that may confer risk for or protection from UUI and UTI. It is now known that urine is not sterile, and that standard urine cultures fail to detect most urinary bacteria (microbiome) regardless of the amount. Present in men and women, the urinary microbiome likely influences bladder health. This study will examine the associations between vitamin D levels, the urinary microbiome, and UUI and UTI risk in both men and women across four racial/ethnic groups. To achieve this goal, the Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) will use the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a large racially diverse cohort of adults followed longitudinally to determine the characteristics of subclinical cardiovascular disease and its progression. At the upcoming 15-year follow-up exam, the mean age of MESA participants will be 70-75 years; in this age group, UUI prevalence exceeds 30% in women and 15% in men. We propose to investigate the association of both current UUI status and future UTI with vitamin D and the urinary microbiome and create prediction models that incorporate both traditional (e.g. obesity, diabetes) and novel (vitamin D and urinary microbiome) risk factors for the identification of individuals at high risk or UUI and UTI. The long-term goal is to design innovative clinical trials to mitigate and prevent UUI and UTI in older men and women.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Urinary urgency incontinence (UUI) is the complaint of involuntary leakage of urine accompanied by a strong and urgent desire to urinate and is associated with increased risk of urinary tract infections (UTI), the second most frequent infection among older adults. UUI is extremely common among older men and women and current treatments are not successful in most patients. The Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) will use an existing racially/ethnically diverse and clinically well-characterized cohort to investigate the association of current UUI status and future UTI with risk factors, both established (e.g., obesity and diabetes) and novel (i.e., vitamin D and the urinary microbiome) and create prediction models that identify individuals at high risk for UUI and UTI.

Most active TB cases arise in adults as a consequence of reactivation of a latent TB infection (LTBI) acquired in childhood. An estimated 2.3 billion people have LTBI, including 10-15 million people in the US. WHO aims to eliminate TB as a public health problem by 2050, and this will require measures to prevent acquisition of LTBI. Vitamin D has long been known to enhance innate immunity to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), and Phase 2 clinical trials show that vitamin D supplementation enhances innate immune resistance to MTB infection. We propose to conduct a Phase 3 double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial to determine whether vitamin D supplementation reduces risk of acquisition of LTBI in 7,350 uninfected schoolchildren aged 6-15 years in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, where rates of LTBI acquisition in children are particularly high as is vitamin D deficiency. Study medication will be administered over 3 years as 72 directly observed bi-weekly oral doses of 28,000 IU Vitamin D3 or placebo. We will employ a well-validated interferon-gamma release assay to determine whether participants have acquired LTBI at 3 years of follow-up (primary outcome). There is professional consensus, as highlighted in recent editorials in the Lancet [2011; 377:189-90] and PNAS [2011; 108, 18861-18862], that the trial we propose needs to be conducted. The PNAS editorial concludes that 'It is a tragic irony that vitamin D, which costs a penny a day and may enhance innate and acquired immunity to TB, is not considered a worthy investment for critical clinical trials that could determine whether supplementation can prevent disease.' The results of this trial will inform global TB control policy by determining whether vitamin D supplementation prevents acquisition of LTBI. More than one billion people worldwide are Vitamin D deficient, and supplementation is safe and inexpensive: intermittent bolus doses of vitamin D are effective in correcting deficiency, are inexpensive, easy to administer, have a very low incidence of adverse effects and much higher degree of acceptability than vaccines and antibiotics. The results of our trial will be readily generalizable to the vitamin D deficient populations at risk of TB worldwide and to the billions already infected with LTBI.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tuberculosis is posing a global emergency; an astonishing one-third of the global population, including 10-15 million people in the United States, are afflicted with a latent TB infection from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The WHO's Stop TB strategy aims to eliminate TB as a public health problem (i.e. to reduce incidence to <1 per million per year) by 2050. The results of this trial will inform global TB control policy by determining whether vitamin D supplementation protects against TB infection.",

Sarcopenia is one of the largest public health problems facing a rapidly increasing, aging population in the United States and leads to increased incidence of falls, fractures and associated morbidities. Previous observations from our laboratory, as well as from many other laboratories, have demonstrated the efficacy of 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutyrate (HMB) alone or in combination with other amino acids in enhancing muscle strength and function in young athletes. We have recently demonstrated that the combination of HMB with two other amino acids, arginine and lysine, was effective in increasing muscle mass in elderly men and women during a year-long prospective study. When analyzing the data (Preliminary Results), we demonstrated a close correlation between the levels of 25-OH Vitamin D3 in this population and the level of improvement in muscle strength. We noted that individuals with plasma 25-OH Vitamin D3 levels >30 ng/ml manifested muscle strength gains supplemented with HMB and two amino acids, while those with plasma 25- OH Vitamin D3 of <30 ng/ml did not. These data form the basis of our current hypothesis that the combination of HMB and Vitamin D supplementation will be synergistic and will result in significant enhancements in overall muscle strength, function and muscle mass. We propose these Phase I and Phase II studies to prove our hypothesis. The Phase I study will test the short-term (12-wk) efficacy of a combination of HMB and Vitamin D to prevent and reverse muscle sarcopenia and the associated losses of muscular strength and functionality in older adults. We plan to recruit 100 men and women who will be assigned to one of four dietary treatments: (1) Control; (2) HMB (calcium salt), 3.0 g/day; (3) 2,000 IU Vitamin D; and (4) HMB, 3.0 g/d + 2,000 IU Vitamin D. The subjects will undergo a 3-day per week exercise program, and body composition and strength will be measured at four week intervals. We expect to demonstrate the synergy between HMB and Vitamin D in this short study. Phase II will test the long-term (12-mos) efficacy of this synergistic combination of HMB and Vitamin D on the enhancement of muscle strength and functionality in the elderly, thus leading to improved quality of life. Phase II will include an exercise arm just like Phase I, but will also include a non-exercise arm because many elderly adults do not participate in an exercise program. In addition to body composition and function and strength data, muscle biopsies will be obtained and muscle fiber and proteomic analysis will be performed. We anticipate that the data generated will lead to further research looking at mechanism(s) involved in loss of muscle and muscle function in the elderly. Improvement in muscle strength and muscle function as well as improvements in body composition over the year-long study will be used to market a product containing HMB and Vitamin D.","Current estimates place a large portion of the older U.S. populous at risk for falls with potential morbidities. A large percentage of these falls are directly related to decreased muscle strength and function. Since a significant portion of the older population is at risk of having a Vitamin D deficiency, a product that corrects such deficiencies and specifically targets muscle strength, function, and mass is likely to produce significant improvements in health, improve the quality of life, and in particular, help to decrease the incidence of falls and injury in this group. Moreover, based upon the incidence of widespread Vitamin D deficiency in all ages, we anticipate the younger population will also benefit from similar supplementation.",

Thiamine deficiency diseases, notably wet and dry beriberi, and Wernicke's encephalopathy, a severe neurological syndrome associated with thiamine deficiency, are associated with many diseases and conditions that result from under-nutrition and malabsorption of thiamine (e.g. alcoholism, bariatric surgery) or hyper-metabolic states (e.g., cancer). However mechanistic studies following a recent and disastrous clinical drug trial (that was terminated because the drug, fedratinib, led to Wernicke's encephalopathy) highlighted the importance of pharmaceutical agents as contributors to thiamine deficiency. That is, fedratinib was shown to be a potent inhibitor of thiamine absorption via the thiamine transporter, SLC19A3. In this research application, we bring together NIH and USDA nutrition supported researchers, in response to PAR-15-024. In particular, we propose to test the hypotheses that commonly used medications inhibit SLC19A3-mediated intestinal absorption of thiamine resulting in drug-vitamin interactions. Secondly, we propose that these drug-thiamine interactions produce a detectable metabolic signature that relates to reduction in the activity of enzymes that are dependent on thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), the active metabolite of thiamine. Our hypotheses are based on exciting preliminary studies in our laboratories demonstrating that several prescription drugs, e.g., metformin, pyrimethamine and amiloride, are inhibitors of SLC19A3. Three aims are proposed: 1. Develop and characterize a humanized transgenic mouse model of SLC19A3 that can serve as an animal model to test drugs for their potential to cause thiamine deficiency. 2. Determine the effects of metformin on the pharmacokinetics and metabolic signatures of thiamine in healthy volunteers using a randomized crossover study; and 3. Use a novel miniaturized assay to screen a 2000-compound library of prescription drugs and bioactives to identify compounds that inhibit SLC19A3 and determine the key structural moieties for SLC19A3 inhibition using quantitative structure activity relationship modeling (QSAR). A multi-tiered approach will be used for the proposed studies including drug-vitamin interaction studies in healthy volunteers; metabolomic methods to identify metabolic signatures of thiamine; small molecule screening to identify inhibitors of SLC19A3; and creation and characterization of humanized mouse models of SLC19A3. Collectively, these novel studies will lead to a new knowledge of drug-vitamin interactions and their metabolic signatures. Specifically, the studies will lead to new tools that can be used in nutrient research and to a recognition that therapeutic drugs may adversely affect thiamine absorption and contribute to thiamine deficiency.","Poor nutrition and many diseases are associated with low levels of vitamin B1 (thiamine), which in turn causes health problems such as delirium and tremors. In this research, we will determine whether therapeutic medications contribute to low levels of thiamine by preventing its absorption in the stomach and intestine. Various research methods, which include human and cellular studies and computer methods will be used.",

Dr. Panwar is a clinical investigator with a research focus on the interactions between disturbed iron and mineral metabolism related to kidney disease. This award will provide Dr. Panwar the support necessary to become skilled in patient-oriented clinical and translational research in individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD). To achieve these goals Dr. Panwar has assembled a team of mentors with a wealth of clinical and translational research experience and a track-record in mentoring junior investigators. When this is combined with the exceptional resources, institutional support, and the proposed career development activities, Dr. Panwar will be well positioned to achieve his long-term goal. Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is a key regulator of phosphorus and vitamin D metabolism. An elevation in circulating FGF23 is among the earliest manifestations of disturbed mineral homeostasis in CKD. However, factors that stimulate the increase in FGF23 early in the course of CKD are unclear. Identification of these factors could lead to development of novel therapeutics to reduce FGF23 levels in CKD. This is important in that elevated FGF23 is a strong predictor of increased cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in CKD. Iron deficiency has been shown to stimulate FGF23 via stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 1α, suggesting that correcting iron deficiency in early CKD could be one potential strategy to reduce FGF23 levels in CKD. Converging lines of evidence also suggest that FGF23 can regulate iron bioavailability by modulating the secretion of hepcidin, the central hormone controlling iron homeostasis. However, to date, few studies examined the effects of iron supplementation on FGF23 secretion and conversely, of lowering FGF23 on iron bioavailability in CKD patients. In addition, although hypoxia is a powerful stimulant of HIF1α, no studies have examined whether treating hypoxia lowers FGF23 levels in CKD patients. The current proposal will establish the physiological relevance of these proposed shared pathways by (1) examining the effect of iron infusion on FGF23 levels in individuals with or without CKD (Aim 1.1); (2) determining if lowering of FGF23 would improve iron bioavailability by reducing hepcidin (Aim 1.2); and (3) determining whether correction of hypoxia in CKD patients reduces FGF23 levels (Aim 2). This innovative proposal uses multiple approaches to elucidate the cross-talk between FGF23, iron and hypoxia in CKD patients, with the ultimate goal of identifying novel potential therapeutic targets for improving outcomes in CKD patients. Importantly, findings from these studies will provide the foundation for a future R01 application for Dr. Panwar.","Project Narrative Improved understanding of the factors leading to increased production of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) such as iron deficiency and hypoxia is critical to discovery of novel therapeutic targets to improve FGF23 associated cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in CKD.",

ALD is an inherited paroxysmal disease characterized by fatty acid accumulation and subsequent oxidative stress. Forty percent of ALD boys develop inflammatory cerebral demyelination (cerALD) in their first decade of life. Unfortunately, we have no means of identifying boys at risk for cerALD nor do we have any means of preventing the onset of cerebral ALD. These limitations represent enormous gaps in our standard of care for these patients.  To address these limitations, the candidate and his collaborators consider the relationship of several key areas of current knowledge in cerALD: (1) ALD results from a peroxisomal gene defect that causes an accumulation of fatty acids which expose cells to lipid peroxides and other mediators of oxidative stress, (2) monocyte-lineage cells dominate the leading edge of the demyelinating lesions and (3) the lesions shares histologic features with multiple sclerosis lesions, a disease that has been linked to vitamin D insufficiency.  Armed with this knowledge, the candidate has generated preliminary data showing that (1) low serum 25-OH vitamin D levels predict the onset of cerALD; (2) monocytes and brain myelin in ALD males have low glutathione levels compared to controls; (3) the spinal fluid from cerebral ALD boys shows a cytokine expression profile consistent with oxidative stress in monocyte-lineage cells; and lastly, (4) that oral vitamin D3 supplementation in a murine model of autoimmune demyelination significantly reduces clinical disease and increases intracellular glutathione levels in monocytes.  The candidate proposes a pilot trial to study the effect of oral vitamin D3 supplementation on blood and brain biomarkers of oxidative stress in 20 ALD boys who have not yet developed cerebral ALD. In Aim 1 the candidate will use MRI techniques to monitor brain biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation in response to rising vitamin D levels. In Aim 2, the candidate will use 12-color flow cytometry and tandem mass spectrometry to study the effect of oral vitamin D3 supplementation on markers of oxidative stress in the specific immune cell subsets of study participants. In Aim 3, the candidate will use bio banked ALD monocytes to define the metabolic and immunologic pathways linking vitamin D exposure with glutathione and cytokine modulation. The candidate's long term goal is to develop treatments and biomarkers for the prevention of cerebral ALD. The addition of ALD to universal newborn screening panels in an increasing number of US states bolsters the project's immediate relevance.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) affects an estimated 1:17,000 individuals with men more severely affected than women. Nearly 40% of ALD boys develop severe inflammatory cerebral demyelination (cerebral ALD) during the first decade of life, a complication that is often fatal. There is no available treatment for preventing the onset f cerebral ALD. The proposed work expands on the candidate's observation that low pre- morbid serum vitamin D levels with later onset of cerebral ALD. It specifically examines the effect of ora vitamin D3 supplements on markers of oxidative stress in ALD boys. This has implications for the use of vitamin D3 supplements as a preventive therapy for cerebral ALD, which in turn has implications for newborn screening for ALD.",

A major breakthrough for prevention and cure has been the appreciation that breast cancer is not one disease, rather a collection of cancer subtypes becoming better defined by improved methodologies based upon histopathologic, genetic and molecular signatures. Over time we have applied histological type, grade, tumor size, lymph-node involvement, and estrogen receptor (ER) and HER-2/neu receptor status to help define prognosis and probability of response to therapies, yet these alone have not fully captured the varied behavior of breast cancer. The field is now rapidly progressing with gene expression and proteomic signatures that will help 'personalize' our interventions for individuals. This same concept is relevant to interventions for primary or secondary prevention and is the focus of our translational grant application. Our pre-clinical studies have demonstrated a strong benefit for dietary ω-3 fatty acid rich fish oil for the inhibition of ERPR(-)HER-2/neu(+) mammary tumors in a transgenic mouse model showing decreased tumor incidence, multiplicity and glandular atypia. Thus, our central hypothesis is that the development of aggressive breast cancer sub-types such as of ERPR(-)HER-2/neu(+) or ERPR(-)HER-2/neu(-) (i.e. triple negative) disease may be uniquely responsive to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), the long chain ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) found in fish oil. As a first step towards a future definitive prevention trial in women, we propose to test the efficacy of an ω-3 rich fish il supplement to modulate breast biomarkers indicative of anti-carcinogenic action. We will randomize high risk survivors to a placebo-low dose or high dose ω-3 rich fish oil capsule treatment and employ our breast fine needle aspiration techniques to obtain cells and tissue for analysis of biomarkers of exposure and efficacy. Our multidisciplinary team has developed the following Specific Aims to: (1) Determine the effects of dietary ω-3 fatty acids on biomarkers of exposure and response in women at high risk for recurrent estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor breast cancer +/- HER-2/neu overexpression; and (2) Define the role of dietary ω-3 PUFAs in the epigenetic regulation of the inflammatory responses underlying mammary carcinogenesis as a novel mechanism for the effects of ω-3 PUFAs. Development of these biomarkers of ω-3 PUFA exposure and response will enable the assessment of this bioactive food component in future large-scale prevention trials for women at risk for recurrence of ERPR(-)HER-2/neu(+) or triple negative breast cancer.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The genetic and molecular heterogeneity of breast cancer accounts for wide variability in clinical response and outcome and thus mandates the development of innovative targeted therapies and prevention strategies. The unresolved role of dietary fat content and specifically ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in human breast carcinogenesis, despite compelling pre-clinical studies, raises the possibility that response to dietary fat depends on critical nutrient-gene interactions that may vary between subjects and/or breast cancer subtypes. This study aims to determine the effects of dietary ω-3 fatty acids on biomarkers of exposure and response in women at high risk for recurrent estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor negative breast cancer +/- HER- 2/neu overexpression and their role in the epigenetic regulation of the inflammatory responses underlying mammary carcinogenesis.",

Gut-derived endotoxins normally penetrate the gut epithelium in only trace amounts due to tightly regulated intestinal barrier function. However, endotoxin leakiness is increased under pathological conditions, including alcohol abuse. The barrier function of intestinal epithelium Is provided in part by paracellular apical junction complexes, including tight and adherens junctions, and by a mucus layer.  In our initial systems biology approach to ALD, we found that intestinal trefoil factor (ITF) was by far the most altered (~50-fold down regulated) protein in the liver following chronic alcohol feeding in rats, and subsequent studies also showed marked down regulation of ITF mRNA and protein in the intestines of alcohol fed mice. ITF plays a critical role in the formation and stabilization of intestinal mucus barrier and enhancement of rapid intestinal repair 'restitution'. Formation and restitution of the barrier is also dependent on uninterrupted mucosal blood flow. Intestinal epithelial cells are positioned between an anaerobic lumen and a highly metabolic lamina propria forming a steep physiologic oxygen gradient. Increased hypoxia- inducible factor (HIF) signaling represents a major adaptive response to hypoxic stress by upregulating a variety of gene products, such as ITF and mucins, to form an integrated epithelial barrier. Our preliminary studies demonstrated that chronic alcohol administration decreases intestinal HIF-2α, ITF and tight junction protein expression resulting in increased endotoxemia and ultimately liver injury. Moreover, supplementation with a probiotic strain, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), increased intestinal HIF-2α and ITF expression, decreased endotoxemia and attenuated alcohol induced liver injury. We hypothesize that alcohol exposure causes detrimental metabolic changes favoring intestinal oxidative stress, inflammation, and alterations of HIF responsive signaling with decreased ITF, leading to intestinal barrier dysfunction, blood endotoxemia and ALD. We postulate that probiotic supplementation will attenuate alcohol-induced intestine and liver injury, in part by increasing HIF-mediated expression of mucus protective factors such as ITF in the intestine. We test our hypothesis with 4 specific aims using in vitro, animal, and human studies approaches. Our ultimate goal is the development of new therapies for ALD. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Alcohol overuse/abuse induces organ injury in multiple organs. This translational research project will examine the mechanisms of the beneficial effects of probiotics on the intestine and the liver in an experimental mouse model of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and in mild human alcoholic hepatitis (AH).","No data",

HTE is an assessment of the degree to which the impact of an intervention varies between subgroups. Evidence from trials of selenium supplementation indicates that this is a critical area for investigation of HTE. To date, three major clinical trials of the trace element selenium (Se) as a chemopreventive agent have been completed. First, in the Nutritional Prevention of Cancer (NPC) trial, participants were supplemented with 200 µg of Se per day or matching placebo, and a statistically significant 58% reduction in colorectal cancer incidence among participants randomized to receive the selenium supplement was observed. Next, the results of the Selenium and Vitamin E Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) were published. The largest trial to date of Se for cancer prevention, SELECT demonstrated no reduction in risk of colorectal cancer among men supplemented with 200 µg/d of Se as L-selenomethionine. We have recently completed the Selenium Trial, which was the third major clinical trial of Se for chemoprevention. This was a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in which 1535 participants received 200 µg/d of Se as selenized yeast or placebo to ascertain whether Se supplementation reduced the risk of colorectal adenoma recurrence. No differences in overall colorectal adenoma recurrence by intervention group were detected; however, subgroup analyses revealed the presence of heterogeneity of treatment effect (HTE). Among participants who had an advanced adenoma at baseline, there was a statistically significant reduction in adenoma recurrence for those randomized to Se as compared to placebo. However, there was also a statistically significant increase in the incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) among older participants (>63 years) receiving selenium. These results identify a major research gap regarding the need for identification of individual characteristics that may contribute to HTE and thus determine whether Se supplementation elicits a beneficial or harmful effect. This is a particularly timely question given that approximately half of American adults report using dietary supplements. We propose herein to investigate several factors that may affect individual outcomes related to Se supplementation, including 1) Genetic background; 2) Intake and blood concentrations of fat-soluble antioxidants; and 3) Oxylipin profiles in response to Se supplementation. In summary, we contend that the in vivo efficacy and toxicity of Se in a given individual may be influenced by genetic background, interactions with antioxidants, and oxylipin metabolomic profiles. The findings of this study will have a direct impact on public health recommendations by identifying individual characteristics that may elicit either beneficial or harmful health effects of Se supplementation.","PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed work has the potential to make major contributions to public health recommendations regarding the potential benefits and harms of selenium supplements. We have designed three separate but complementary aims that will elucidate factors that elicit individual differential responses to selenium supplementation using genetic analysis, consideration of fat-soluble antioxidant interactions, and targeted oxylipin profiling.",

Folic acid appears to protect against ASD especially in mothers and children who are genetically susceptible to inefficient folate-dependent one-carbon and methylation metabolism, but this finding needs replication. In addition to being essential for neurodevelopment, folate is a primary methyl-donor for methylation reactions, including DNA methylation. The time near conception is an especially critical period for adequate methyl supply during cycles of active demethylation and re-methylation of the genome during embryogenesis. Our preliminary data show that folic acid supplementation is associated with even greater reductions in ASD risk, by 75%, in younger siblings of children with ASD. In addition, we found DNA methylation differences associated with no maternal use of folic acid supplements in birth tissues (placenta and cord blood) for genes with nuclear regulatory and brain development functions that could have implications for ASD.  The goal of the proposed work is to leverage data and samples from mother-child pairs in two large prospective pregnancy cohorts of high-risk infant siblings to examine specific pathways for prevention of ASD through maternal dietary and supplemental folate intake. This work will build on previous studies by examining exposures collected prospectively, with more accuracy in terms of timing and dose. We will be first to examine whether other methyl-donor B-vitamins have associated effects. We will include information on dietary and supplemental folate and B-vitamin intake from validated instruments, and measurements from maternal first trimester serum, cord blood, and fetal placental tissue. We will examine folic acid interactions with genetic susceptibility factors. Finally, we will increase understanding of the underlying mechanisms by identifying DNA methylation changes associated with folate status, and investigate whether these changes overlap with methylation patterns observed in autistic brains, using innovative methods, multiple platforms, and replication across tissue type and study population, to address challenges associated with DNA methylation measurement. Through completion of the proposed project, we will gain a better understanding of how strongly folic acid is associated with reduced risk of ASD in high-risk families, when intake is most associated and at what levels, how this association differs based on genetic susceptibility, and whether maternal folic acid intake alters DNA methylation profiles in ways that could decrease ASD risk. These findings will have great clinical and public health implications, informing autism prevention trial and ultimately changes in recommendations and policy.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Through completion of the proposed project, we will gain a better understanding of how strongly folic acid and other B-vitamins are associated with reduced risk of ASD in younger siblings within high-risk families, when intake is most associated and at what levels, how the folate association differs based on genetic susceptibility, and whether maternal folic acid intake alters DNA methylation profiles in ways that could decrease ASD risk.

Dr. Bethea’s long-term goal is to carry out studies that will result in a better understanding of factors that influence cancer survivorship and that will lead, ultimately, to higher survival among Black women affected by breast cancer and reduced cancer health disparities. She has already had training in environmental health and cancer epidemiology. Through the K01 training, she will develop expertise in cancer survivorship, statistical analyses of survival data, and molecular epidemiology, under the mentorship of a distinguished panel of researchers – Drs. Julie Palmer, Christine Ambrosone, Nancy Keating, Michael LaValley, and Edward Ruiz-Narváez. The mortality rate from breast cancer, the most commonly occurring cancer among women in the U.S., is 42% higher in Black women than White women. Dr. Bethea’s research will address an understudied topic, modifiable factors related to breast cancer survivorship in Black women. To this end, her proposed research utilizes data from the Black Women’s Health Study (BWHS), a longitudinal study of 59,000 African American women. During follow-up, more than 2,300 incident invasive breast cancer cases have occurred and they will be the subject of Dr. Bethea’s research. Dr. Bethea will assess several modifiable risk factors – post-diagnosis use of aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and post- diagnosis use of vitamin D supplements and of predicted plasma vitamin D levels – in relation to breast cancer recurrence and breast cancer-specific mortality among breast cancer cases in the BWHS. She will create genetic risk scores using data on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from candidate genes and will assess whether the associations of aspirin/other NSAIDs or of vitamin D supplementation and predicted plasma vitamin D levels with breast cancer recurrence and breast cancer-specific mortality are modified by genetic risk scores. Thus, Dr. Bethea will create a specific area of research in which she is highly proficient. As an independent researcher, it is anticipated that she will lead further BWHS research on cancer survivorship, which could be stand-alone studies or collaborative studies with other investigators. Dr. Bethea is an outstanding candidate. A K01 career development award will enable her to conduct important research as an independent investigator and put her on the path to obtaining NIH R01 and similar grant support and on a path to promotion. Importantly, it will also provide valuable information on factors related to breast cancer survival in Black women.","PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposal will support didactic training and mentored research in cancer survival and molecular epidemiology for Dr. Traci Bethea.

Most cases are sporadic, but Mendelian pedigrees have been described, typically with low penetrance. Few genes have been identified, encoding transcription and growth factors (e.g. SOX2, BMP4) active during early eye development. Most cases are unexplained. Maternal nutrition may contribute to the etiology. We found mutations in three retinoid (vitamin A) pathway genes (RBP4, STRA6, ALDH1A3) account for >5% of MAC cases, including a new gain-of-function mechanism for this disease. The RBP4 alleles encode dominant-negative serum retinol binding proteins, which bind retinol cargo poorly but adhere to the STRA6 cell surface receptor too tightly (40-fold higher affinity) – so may disrupt retinol transfer across the yolk sac and placenta, to the embryo. The dnRBP4 mutations define a new mode of maternal inheritance and illuminate a critical protein- receptor interaction. In addition, clustered hypomorphic STRA6 alleles suggest a new domain function for this polytopic receptor. We will investigate the mechanism for increased RBP affinity and critical features of the RBP-STRA6 interaction, and test the receptor competition model for MAC pathogenesis [1] in vitro and [2] in vivo, using a comprehensive biochemical, cell-based, radioisotopic and histological approach, mouse models with specific knock-out or genome-edited (CRISPR/Cas9) alleles, and dietary manipulation. In addition, [3] we will systematically screen a cohort of MAC patients using whole exome sequencing (WES) and segmental dosage (SNP) analysis to find causative mutations in new genes.","NARRATIVE We will investigate gene defects in children whose eyes are absent (anophthalmia), very small or malformed (coloboma), using biochemical methods, mouse models and genome sequencing.

Recent studies suggest the exciting possibility that vitamin D supplementation, a safe and easy-to-implement therapy in children, may lengthen PCR and increase residual beta cell function (RBCF). However, existing studies employed a suboptimal vitamin D dose or lacked a standardized insulin treatment protocol, precluding solid conclusions and preventing the field from moving forward with translation to clinical practice. This trial's rationale is to securely establish the effect of an adequate dose of vitamin D on PCR and RBCF. We hypothesize that vitamin D will increase RBCF and prolong PCR. The primary aim is to determine the effect of adjunctive vitamin D on RBCF and PCR in youth with T1D maintained on a standardized insulin protocol. We propose a 12-month randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled, parallel design trial of ergocalciferol vs. placebo in 40 subjects of 10-21 years with newly-diagnosed T1D. The primary outcome is the change over time in stimulated C-peptide (a measure of RBCF). Secondary outcomes include change over time in insulin-dose- adjusted-hemoglobin-A1c (HbA1c) (IDAA1C; a measure of PCR), HbA1c, and total daily dose of insulin. Mechanistic studies will explore whether beneficial effects of vitamin D are associated with increased GLP-1 levels or decreased inflammatory markers, and whether response to vitamin D is impacted by T1D-risk polymorphisms. If our hypotheses are true, these findings may completely alter the approach to the early management of T1D, with strong emphasis on prolonging the honeymoon phase using a readily available and easily affordable vitamin D while maintaining these patients on a standardized insulin treatment regimen.","Project Narrative This project is designed to study the role of vitamin D supplementation on the honeymoon phase of type 1 diabetes in children who are on standardized insulin treatment.

Evidence for a role of these agents in preventing cancer, CVD, and other diseases remains inconclusive regarding causality and insufficient to inform nutritional recommendations for primary prevention. Appropriately designed randomized trials in general populations are lacking. To fill this knowledge gap, we have been conducting VITAL, a highly innovative, cost-efficient, large-scale, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical tria among 26,000 U.S. men and women without cancer or CVD at baseline, who have been selected only on age (men aged e50 and women aged e55), with an oversampling of blacks (ne5000). In a 2x2 factorial design, participants have been randomized to vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol, 2000 IU/d) and marine omega-3 fatty acids (Omacor(R) fish oil, 1 g/d, containing eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] + docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) supplements (or placebos) independently. Contingent on continued funding, the median treatment period will be 5 years. During the first cycle, we have successfully met or surpassed our recruitment goals, enrolled a racially/ethnically diverse cohort, collected baseline blood/DNA samples on >16,000 participants (with plans for follow-up bloods in 6000), and conducted extensive validation studies of the laboratory assays for vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid measurements in the trial. Annual follow-up questionnaires assess treatment compliance (confirmed by blood samples in a subset of participants), side effects, endpoint occurrence, and cancer and vascular risk factors. Self-reported endpoints are confirmed by medical record review by physicians blinded to treatment assignment, and deaths are ascertained through the National Death Index-Plus and other sources. Our archived blood samples allow assessment of effect modification by baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid levels, changes in biomarkers over time, and testing of genetic/biochemical hypotheses. With our scientific colleagues, we have obtained funding for 18 ancillary studies to evaluate the role of these supplements in preventing other chronic diseases (including diabetes, cognitive decline, depression, and autoimmune disorders), and established an in-clinic component for in-depth phenotyping of a subcohort (n=1000).

These are among the most bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms – associated with worse mental health, poor physical well-being, and increased falls, fractures, and nursing home placement. Despite treatment options, many patients do not become symptom-free and discontinue medications due to side effects or perceived inefficacy. Attention is shifting to possible prevention and early treatment strategies. Potential benefits of vitamin D may extend to several relevant organ systems, and vitamin D could act via multiple pathways to reduce lower urinary tract symptoms by improving detrusor activity and decreasing inflammation. Indeed, evidence emerging from epidemiologic studies indicate that higher vitamin D levels are associated with decreased risk for OAB and UI.  In this revision application, we will leverage two large, complementary epidemiologic studies – the VITamin D and omegA-3 TriaL (VITAL, n=25,000 women and men) and the observational Nurses’ Health Studies (n>100,000 women) -- to conduct a rich exploration of vitamin D and OAB, as well as UUI. In this revision, we extend research to both OAB and UUI, increasing clinical relevance by broadening the outcomes (previously only UI) while focusing on symptoms related to detrusor contractility. We also improve innovation by targeting research in: (1) African Americans (n=2300 in NHS, n=5200 in VITAL), who disproportionately suffer from OAB and UUI, and have higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency; and in (2) obese adults (n=34,000 in NHS, n=7200 in VITAL), who are at higher risk of OAB and UUI, and have lower bioavailability of vitamin D as it is retained in adipose tissue. Our main Aims are to: 1) assess if vitamin D3 supplementation decreases OAB and UUI in VITAL, where participants have been assigned to 2000IU/day of vitamin D or placebo for five years, and in NHS, where observational data are available on a large range of doses, from <400 IU to >800 and >1000 IU/day; and 2) to prospectively assess if higher plasma 25(OH)D levels at baseline are related to a decreased incidence and progression of UUI in the NHS. In VITAL, where an estimated 50% of participants had 25(OH)D<30ng/mL at baseline, we propose to collect data on OAB and UI symptoms at year 5 by adding new questions on urgency, frequency, nocturia and urine leakage at the close of the trial. The NHS already includes extensive UUI data, and we will newly measure baseline vitamin D levels from stored blood samples and add OAB questions in upcoming follow-up periods. The large samples of African American and of obese adults in these cohorts uniquely enable important and novel research. The expected outcomes will be to provide exciting new knowledge regarding vitamin D as a possible convenient, low-cost intervention for preventing OAB and UUI symptoms and progression among women and men, specifically targeting high-risk subgroups of African Americans and obese adults.","PROJECT NARRATIVE Overactive bladder (OAB) can occur with or without urgency urinary incontinence (UUI). OAB and UUI affects the lives of millions of men and women and is very costly. Emerging evidence from epidemiologic studies link higher vitamin D levels with lower rates of OAB and UUI. With this proposal, our goal is to understand the relationship of vitamin D supplementation compared to placebo on OAB and UUI symptoms, especially in high- risk subgroups. We will also evaluate how supplementation may improve new-onset OAB and UUI over time.",

Infrastructure support is needed to accrue an additional 2,700 new cancer cases over the next five years to accomplish the overall goal of conducting innovative research that evaluates how environmental and lifestyle exposures, and genetic susceptibility together affect cancer incidence, mortality and aging-related outcomes. In addition to collecting questionnaire information, these two Asian cohorts include an established biorepository with blood, buccal and urine samples from more than 50,000 participants. With the vigorous follow-up procedures in place, only 1.5 percent of the original cohort participants have been lost to follow-up. To date, approximately 17 percent of the cohort members were diagnosed with incident cancers; approximately 50 percent of the cancer patients have stored biospecimens.

This project will address underlying mechanisms to account for immune dysregulation, including early molecular markers of autoimmunity, associated with proximity to AUM and uranium and mixed metal exposure. Biomonitoring results confirm that community members are exposed to uranium and other metals beyond national norms. Our published and preliminary work shows that certain metals interact with key cellular targets to disrupt zinc-dependent protein function. We will test the hypothesis that metals disrupt multiple classes of zinc binding proteins known to regulate immune responses, and that supplemental zinc will mitigate immunotoxicity resulting from metal exposures. In Aim 1 aim we will investigate whether serum zinc sufficiency modifies immune dysregulation in individuals exposed to environmental metals by performing a cross-sectional analysis of archived population samples for associations between markers of immune function with metal and zinc levels present in blood and urine samples. Aim 2 will test the immunotoxic effects and underlying mechanisms of U, As and environmentally relevant metal mixtures defined by the Environmental Projects, and whether the immunotoxic effects are reduced by supplemental zinc in cell and mouse models. Aim 3 will test whether dietary zinc supplementation will decrease biomarkers of immune dysregulation in exposed populations in partnership with exposed communities.

Vitamin D can influence the regulation of genes responsible for metabolism and transport processes that mediate xenobiotic clearance. This is highly relevant since vitamin D treatment is common, as deficiency (total 25(OH)D level <30 ng/mL) is observed in up to 90% of CKD cohorts. Previous published research by the Principal Investigators and others has shown that renal and nonrenal xenobiotic clearance pathways mediated by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and transporters is altered in CKD. Given the 24 M US citizens with CKD are prescribed an average of 10-12 different medications daily, the clinical realities of altered xenobiotic clearance in CKD (drug interactions, side effects, altered efficacy, and confusion for clinicians prescribing and/or monitoring treatments) are not trivial. Importantly, increasing evidence indicates that vitamin D deficiency is a significant non-traditional cardiovascular risk factor, and vitamin D is important or bone and musculoskeletal health, kidney protection, cancer prevention, and decreased severity or risk of autoimmune and infectious diseases. In this proposal, we developed a translational study employing in vivo and in vitro studies to investigate how vitamin D alters the activity of drug metabolism and transport pathways in CKD. We propose to characterize the in vivo activity of xenobiotic metabolism and transport pathways in CKD patients and healthy controls under the opposing influences of vitamin D deficiency and repletion. Moreover, physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models will explore mechanisms for vitamin D and uremia on variations in drug metabolism and transport using data derived from the planned in vivo and in vitro studies. Our central hypothesis is that vitamin D status independently affects metabolism and transport function in CKD patients. An over-arching goal of this proposal is to make drug therapies safer and more effective to reduce the significant morbidity and mortality in patients with CKD. Three independent Specific Aims comprised of in vivo and in vitro studies were formulated to address the key hypotheses: 1) The in vivo function of individual pathways of xenobiotic metabolism and transport are affected by vitamin D status and by CKD, 2) CKD alters the activity of individual CYPs responsible for vitamin D metabolism, leading to modified pharmacokinetics of cholecalciferol, and 3) Vitamin D treatment and simulated CKD differentially alter the expression and function of drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters in kidney and liver cells. These studies will be central to determine where more scrutiny is warranted in evaluating clinical risks for drug interactions, altered efficacy and toxicity of therapies, and for guidance on appropriate vitamin D deficiency and maintenance regimens. Long term benefits of this research are improvements in medication management, drug dosing guidelines, and corresponding outcomes in targeted organs and/or diseases for vitamin D treated patients. The proposed research would have high impact through the public health benefit of improving care provided to CKD patients, serving as a basis for future study of alterations in drug metabolism and transport, and provision of much needed information on vitamin D metabolism and pharmacokinetics in CKD.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patients with chronic kidney disease have alterations in the way the body handles medications. There is also a high rate of vitamin D deficiency among chronic kidney disease patients. We plan to study how vitamin D affects the metabolism and transport of medications and how vitamin D is metabolized in the body of patients with kidney disease.",

The first two funding cycles were dedicated to elucidating the  fundamental mechanisms that induce the ‘alcoholic lung phenotype’. Our experimental findings have  elucidated central roles for oxidative stress (including profound glutathione depletion), zinc  deficiency, and decreased expression and function of PPARγ in mediating the effects of alcohol.  More recently we identified that alcohol inhibits the actions of Nrf2, the transcription factor  that activates the anti-oxidant response element (ARE) and programmatically induces the expression  of hundreds of genes (including those involved in glutathione homeostasis) required to defend  against inflammatory stresses. Moreover, Nrf2 and PPARγ activity appear to be zinc-dependent and  therefore these pathways may be interdependent and therefore coordinately targeted by alcohol.  Remarkably, these same pathways are targeted during chronic HIV infection, and we have determined  that alcohol and HIV- related proteins have additive toxicities on lung epithelial and macrophage  function. As our Center   investigators are also engaged in translational clinical trials in  HIV-mediated lung disease, we have the unique capacity to study the combined effects of alcohol and  HIV and how this combination may pose a challenge to developing effective therapies. These  discoveries have not only revealed the mechanisms by which alcohol renders the lung susceptible to  injury but have also identified candidate therapies targets that Center investigators are testing  in experimental models and clinical trials. This new Project 3 will coordinate and direct our  ‘clinical trials pipeline’ and shepherd discoveries from the laboratory to interventional trials.  The goals of Project 3 are to: 1) Determine the efficacy of dietary supplementation with zinc  and/or SAMe in reversing the alcoholic lung phenotype in subjects with alcohol use disorders and,  in parallel, how regular alcohol use affects the efficacy of dietary zinc + SAMe in reversing lung  dysfunction in individuals living with HIV.  2) Exploit our experimental and clinical translational  studies on alcohol-induced inhibition of PPARγ signaling to conduct a clinical trial to determine  if treatment with the PPARγ ligand pioglitazone can reverse the alcoholic lung phenotype in  subjects with alcohol use disorders. 3) In collaboration with Projects 1 and 2, determine if Nrf2  activators, alone or in combination with zinc, can rapidly reverse the alcoholic lung phenotype in  animal models in vivo and in human alveolar macrophages ex vivo, and translate these studies to a  clinical trial of agents such as sulforaphane, alone or in combination with zinc, in subjects with  alcohol use disorders. Success in any of these trials in our pipeline will have enormous  implications for individuals struggling with alcohol use disorders, including those also living  with HIV.","The Emory Alcohol and Lung Biology Center investigators have been pioneers in the field ever since  its founding members identified that chronic alcohol ingestion causes profound oxidative stress  within the airways and renders even otherwise healthy individuals, including premature infants  whose mothers drank excessively during pregnancy, at high risk for pneumonia and acute lung injury.  Since its formal inception on January 1st, 2003, the Center and its integrated T32 Training  Programs have elucidated the fundamental mechanisms by which alcohol impairs lung function and we  are translating these findings to human studies and novel interventional clinical trials with the  goal of mitigating or even reversing the ‘alcoholic lung phenotype’.  As a result, the Center  attracts world-class scientists from multiple disciplines and is a fertile training environment for  pre- and post-doctoral fellows as well as junior faculty researchers who are expanding and  enhancing the alcohol research field.",

Roughly 0.5% of preeclampsia is early onset and occurs at < 34 weeks gestation, thus annually affecting up to 20,000 U.S. women and infants. There is no treatment other than delivery. Expectant management of early onset preeclampsia (EOP) to gain in-utero time for the fetus has been reported; however half of the cases of preterm birth in women with EOP occur due to maternal complications such as development of severe hypertension or other end organ damage. It is believed that preeclampsia originates with shallow trophoblast invasion. This results in activation of the vascular endothelium with subsequent upregulation of soluble fms-tyrosine kinase (sFlt-1); stimulation of endothelin (ET)-1; and activation of ADPR-cyclase leading to potent vasocontriction. Nicotinamide is a water-soluble vitamin that inhibits ADPR-cyclase and thus acts to reduce the downstream effects of sFlt-1 upregulation. Using mouse models of preeclampsia characterized by ET-1 upregulation or abnormal placentation we show that nicotinamide reduces hypertension and proteinuria and increases maternal and fetal survival. Our phase I study of low-dose oral nicotinamide in 10 women with EOP demonstrates safety and tolerability. Building on our preclinical and phase I study findings, the objectives of this proposal are to test the effect of higher dose nicotinamide supplementation in women with EOP on maternal mean arterial pressure (MAP) and further evaluate its safety. Demonstration of beneficial effects of nicotinamide dietary supplementation on maternal BP will be the first evidence to date to support medical treatment of EOP to attempt to delay delivery. Successful completion of this proposal will guide the development of a future clinical study of this low cost, nontoxic dietary supplement for prolonging gestation in EOP. !","Public Health Relevance Statement Nicotinamide (vitamin B3-amide) is a nontoxic water-soluble amide of vitamin B3 that lowers blood pressure and mortality in a mouse model of preeclampsia, probably via its inhibitory action on ADPR-cyclase. We will test the ability of nicotinamide to lower maternal blood pressure and reduce risk of development of severe hypertension in women with early-onset preeclampsia. Such effects would demonstrate feasibility of studying nicotinamide as a therapeutic in EOP to prolong gestation and reduce medically indicated preterm birth.",

Recent findings from the Physicians’ Health Study II, the only large-scale clinical trial of a daily multivitamin, indicated a significant reduction in cataract, but an elevated, though statistically non-significant, increased risk of AMD. These findings in men require confirmation in other men and extension to women. The proposed study will utilize resources and data from the COcoa-Supplement and Multivitamins Outcomes Study (COSMOS), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2x2 factorial trial testing a patented, high-quality cocoa extract supplement (Mars Symbioscience) and Centrum Silver multivitamin (Pfizer) in the prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer among 12,000 women aged ≥65 years and 6,000 men aged ≥60 years with 4 years of treatment and follow-up. Woman participants will be drawn from the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) cohort, and male participants will be drawn from a target population screened for participation (but not randomized) in the VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL). Beginning in June, 2015 and continuing through 2016, willing and eligible respondents to an invitational mailing will be enrolled in a 3-month run-in. Those who demonstrate good compliance with pill taking during the run-in, and remain willing and eligible, will be randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups for 5 years. At 1-year intervals, participants will receive a new supply of pills and a follow-up questionnaire on compliance, possible side effects, and incidence of endpoints. We propose to document incident cataract and prevalent and incident AMD endpoints in the COSMOS cohort in order to evaluate the efficacy of multivitamin and cocoa extract supplements in cataract and AMD prevention. The primary aims of the proposed study are to test whether 1) a daily multivitamin will reduce the risk of cataract; 2) a daily multivitamin will reduce the risk of total AMD events, a composite of incident AMD plus cases of progression to advanced AMD (neovascular AMD plus central geographic atrophy) among participants with prevalent AMD at baseline. The effect of cocoa extract supplements (capsule containing 750 mg/d flavanols, including 75 mg (-)-epicatechin, and 90 mg theobromine) in reducing risks of AMD and cataract will be examined as secondary aims. This research is responsive to a program priority of the National Eye Institute’s Strategic Plan to improve diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of eye disease. We believe the proposed eye disease ancillary to COSMOS offers a unique opportunity to obtain a reliable, efficient, and informative evaluation of the efficacy of two extremely promising preventive agents for cataract and AMD at a fraction of the cost of separate trials.","PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite the wide-spread usage of multivitamin supplements, and the growing enthusiasm for cocoa supplements, definitive data on the balance of risks and benefits of these agents are lacking. Data from this large-scale randomized trial should clarify the role of multivitamin and cocoa supplements in the prevention of cataract and AMD, two leading causes of visual impairment in US men and women.",
"5","P20","GM109096-03","Prevention of Childhood Obesity Through Improved Maternal Insulin Sensitivity","5997","No data","Andres, Aline ","UNITED STATES","230607","2018","GM","PROJECT SUMMARY In the United States, more than one out of every two women who conceive a child is overweight or obese. Obesity is a complex disorder and there are likely multiple causative factors emerging at various times through life. We have previously demonstrated in preclinical studies that offspring have altered metabolism when the fetuses are exposed to the consequences of maternal obesity in utero. The major effects relate to how the offspring metabolize energy and store excess energy. Offspring of obese women can spare and store more ingested energy as excess fat than offspring of lean women who burn more of their energy. Preliminary data from our ongoing clinical studies show that offspring of overweight women have increased fat mass at age 2 weeks and increased weight at age 2 years. One in two American infants will have been exposed to adverse metabolic conditions while developing in utero, and this increases the risk of developing obesity later in life. Although weight loss prior to pregnancy would be the preferred line of action, in light of the high incidence of unplanned pregnancies and the low success rate of significant weight loss among women, one critical strategy is to develop interventions during pregnancy to prevent childhood obesity.  The objective of this proposal is to test an intervention that would reduce the effect of maternal obesity on the offspring and therefore prevent their risk of developing childhood obesity. The proposed study will test the efficacy of probiotics supplementation during pregnancy on preventing childhood obesity. To test these hypotheses we have designed a prospective randomized double blinded control trial. For this study we will recruit 104 obese women within the first 12 weeks of gestation and follow them throughout pregnancy and during their child's first two weeks of life. The obese women will be randomized to either a placebo (N=52) or to an intervention group (N=52). The intervention group will consist of a daily probiotic supplementation, whereas the control group will be administered a placebo. During the length of the study we will: carefully quantify maternal and child adiposity (fat mass); study maternal metabolism (dietary intake and energy expenditure); acquire dietary intakes and evaluate circulating levels of key metabolic markers. The specific aims will first demonstrate the potential for a probiotic intervention during gestation to improve maternal glucose use in obese women. For this aim, maternal fasting glucose and insulin levels will be assessed throughout pregnancy in the intervention group compared to the placebo group. The specific aims will also test whether a probiotic intervention during pregnancy in obese women alter offspring fat mass and decrease the risk of obesity in the offspring. To answer these questions, placenta, umbilical cord and cord blood will be obtained to study glucose, insulin and gene expression.","No data",

TACT2, if positive, will also promote research into the mechanism(s) of benefits and provide novel insights into the pathobiology of CAD. The Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy (TACT1) was developed in response to a Request for Applications from NCCAM and the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) to address the concern that chelation use was widespread but there were no reliable data on either safety or efficacy. Surprisingly to cardiologists, the chelation strategy,  combination of up to 40 infusions with intravenous disodium EDTA plus oral multivitamins and multiminerals (OMVM) compared with intravenous and oral placebo, led to a significant reduction in the time to first recurrent cardiovascular event in patients with prior myocardial infarction (MI), age 50 or older, already treated with standard evidence based medical therapies (HR 0.74; 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.57- 0.95; p=0.016. The 5-year number needed to treat (NNT) was 12.

As aGvHD is responsible for nearly 20% of deaths following alloHCT, the need for better prevention and therapy for aGvHD is readily apparent. Involvement of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract in the pathogenesis of aGvHD has been substantiated by the translation of pre-clinical and clinical studies. Emerging evidence suggests that perturbations in the microbiota diversity result in aberrant systemic immune response as well as pathogen colonization and mucosal invasion, fostering the development of GvHD. Pre-clinical studies also suggest that replenishing commensals like Lactobacillus prior to HCT substantially decrease GvHD severity and intestinal insult. Our pilot data suggest that probiotics are safe to administer prior to and during children and adolescents undergoing HCT (IND#108,977). This proposal is a double-blind, randomized, multi-center intervention trial to evaluate the specific effect of probiotics in preventing GI aGvHD and more generally the effects on overall GvHD severity. The proposal is an approved concept of Children’s Oncology Group’s (COG), a NCI National Clinical Trial Network group. The study will be conducted through COG using its clinical research infrastructure. Correlative laboratory studies (plasma and stool analysis) will be performed in order to elucidate the mechanisms of action of probiotic therapy. The probiotic, Lactobacillus plantarum (LBP), or placebo will be administered to 384 evaluable children and adolescents undergoing alloHCT for hematologic malignancy beginning with the initiation of conditioning through Day 56. We hypothesize that maintaining epithelial cell integrity through the administration of probiotic therapy will lead to restoring microbial diversity, which will preserve immune tolerance and prevent aGvHD. The primary study aim is to determine efficacy of orally-administered LBP in preventing the development of GI aGvHD in children and adolescents undergoing alloHCT for the treatment of cancer. Secondary study aims are: (1) To determine whether orally-administered LBP decreases the incidence of Grade II–IV aGvHD following alloHCT; (2) To determine whether LBP administration maintains intestinal integrity as measured by mean plasma citrulline levels and reduction in mucosal barrier injury (MBI) bacteremia; (3a) To measure the effects of LBP on the intestinal flora phylogenetic composition during and after alloHCT using 16S rRNA gene deep sequencing; (3b) To measure effects of LBP on intestinal flora function during and after alloHCT using metagenomic and metabolite profiling; and (4) To measure proposed immunomodulatory effects of LBP in mean plasma levels of alloreactive-induced inflammatory cytokines (IL-2, IL-6, IL-12p70, IFNγ, and TNFα) in patients receiving LBP compared to placebo. The proposed study will be the first double-blind randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of probiotics in preventing GI aGvHD in pediatric HCT. If a beneficial effect is observed, expansion of the proposed intervention to other pediatric and adult malignant conditions requiring alloHCT may improve overall quality of life and prevent transplant-related complications like aGvHD.","Project Narrative The proposed study is a randomized, controlled intervention trial to determine the benefit of probiotic therapy in preventing the development of gastrointestinal acute graft versus host disease in children undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation for a hematologic malignancy.

Low bone mineral density (BMD) in childhood increases the risk of early osteoporosis and bone fracture later in life, which has serious individual and societal implications due to the impaired mobility, the associated morbidity and even mortality in older adults. Our long-term goal is to identify vulnerable pediatri populations at risk for bone loss in order to improve their bone health through an early intervention. This study focuses on the prevention of bone loss that occurs in children and adolescents treated with hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for hematologic malignancies. An increase in bone resorption that occurs after HCT in these patients offers an opportunity for intervention with an anti-resorptive agent, yet no prospective studies have been performed that examine the effectiveness of any bisphosphonate or other anti-resorptive agent in pediatric HCT recipients. Therefore, we propose to conduct a prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial of calcium and vitamin D plus pamidronate versus calcium and vitamin D alone to prevent bone loss after pediatric HCT. The central hypothesis is that subjects treated with pamidronate and calcium and vitamin D (Pamidronate Group) will have higher bone mineral content (BMC) and BMD measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and by peripheral quantitative CT, respectively, at 1 year post-HCT than subjects receiving calcium and vitamin D alone (Control Group). The rationale for this study is that treatment with pamidronate at the time of peak bone resorption can prevent/reverse bone loss and have a positive long-term impact on bone health in pediatric HCT recipients. We will pursue three specific aims: 1) To determine the impact of calcium and vitamin D plus pamidronate versus calcium and vitamin D alone on BMC and BMD following HCT in 60 recipients aged 1-18 years at HCT; 2) To characterize the time course of changes in cytokine levels (IL-6, IL-7, TNF-a) associated with the activation of osteoclasts after HCT and their association with BMC and BMD; 3) To examine the sequence of changes in markers of bone turnover after HCT and their response to pamidronate treatment. The current study is innovative in that it is the first to prospectively evaluate the effects of an anti- resortive agent administered shortly after HCT on BMC and BMD in children. This study is expected to have an important positive impact on bone health in children and the field of pediatric endocrinology by providing much needed prospective data on the effectiveness of an anti-resorptive agent after pediatric HCT. The preventive intervention that this project seeks to examine is likely to have an impact on current clinical practice. While biomarkers of bone turnover have been used in adult studies, there is a striking paucity of data on the clinical applicability of these markers in children and adolescents. Evaluating changes in these markers and cytokines after HCT will provide insight into the underlying mechanisms of bone loss.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hematopoietic cell transplantation is being utilized for an increasing number of both malignant and non- malignant disorders and the overall success rates of the procedure continues to improve. Therefore we are now seeing more and more patients who are survivors, but also more who face the long-term consequences of this very intensive form of therapy. Low bone mineral density is increasingly being recognized as a common consequence of bone marrow transplantation. Since childhood and adolescence are critical time periods for establishing peak bone mass for the rest of the adult life, it is importat to intervene early to prevent bone loss and reduce the risk of early osteoporosis and fracture later in life, which can have a significant impact on functional outcomes, ability to work, as well as quality of life.",

However, iron also plays an essential role in the life cycle of HIV and opportunistic infections, calling into question the relative safety and benefits of iron supplementation among HIV-infected populations. Epidemiologic studies of HIV-infected adults suggest harmful effects of elevated iron status, protective effects of iron deficiency, and uncertain effects of iron supplementation. The role of iron in pediatric HIV infection and disease is less certain due to the higher prevalence of iron deficiency among children as well as differences between adult and pediatric HIV transmission, clinical presentation, and treatment approach.

There are several mechanisms by which low vitamin D status may promote AD pathology, including reduced β-amyloid (Aβ) clearance, dysregulation of calcium influx and glutamate- mediated neurotoxicity. Vitamin D interacts with receptors in the hippocampus and many other brain regions, and has established antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Recent neuroimaging studies have found that low vitamin D levels are associated with increased periventricular white matter disease, reduced white matter volume and larger ventricles. Vitamin D deficiency may also have a toxic effect on brain function independent of Aβ metabolism. Preliminary studies of serum vitamin D levels in a diverse multi-ethnic cohort (n=382) of the UC Davis Alzheimer's Disease Center found a high prevalence of low vitamin D status (61% with levels <20 ng/ml), which was associated with faster rates of decline on executive function and episodic memory. This Phase II randomized clinical trial aims to test if supplementation with high dose oral vitamin D will successfully correct vitamin D insufficiency, compared to treatment with standard (RDA) dose vitamin D in a diverse community-based elderly cohort. The effect of high-dose vs. standard-dose vitamin D on altering cognitive trajectories will also be assessed and data will be expected to be used in designing a potential definitive Phase III trial in elderly groups at risk for dementia.

Vitamin D receptor genotype polymorphisms and their impact on response to oral supplementation will also be examined. If vitamin D supplementation improves cognitive outcome, this could have a large impact on the public health, since low vitamin D status is a common, readably treatable condition which may provide a novel window to prevent dementia and AD.

Published evidence links MCI to elevated oxidative stress caused by increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). To defend against the damaging potential of ROS (which causes oxidative stress, OxS), cells normally depend on antioxidants, and Glutathione (GSH) is the main component of human endogenous intracellular antioxidant defenses. GSH is a tripeptide composed of three amino-acids, cysteine, glycine and glutamic acid. Since elderly humans are known to have an increased risk of developing elevated OxS and GSH deficiency, we investigated and reported that intracellular GSH deficiency in elderly humans occurs primarily due to intracellular deficiency of two of its precursor amino-acids cysteine and glycine, but not glutamic acid, and that these GSH-deficient elderly humans had elevated ROS levels indicating elevated OxS. Supplementing cysteine (as n-acetylcysteine) plus glycine orally as capsules for 2-weeks replenished their own intracellular concentrations, improved intracellular GSH synthesis, restored intracellular GSH levels and lowered ROS/OxS to levels seen in younger humans. GSH is also a key component of mitochondrial antioxidant defenses, and GSH depletion induces mitochondrial dysfunction with elevated ROS levels, neuronal injury and apoptosis. We studied and reported that mitochondrial dysfunction and OxS in aging (elderly humans and aged mice) can be improved by correcting GSH deficiency. These findings have implications for MCI in elderly humans. In a small ongoing open-label pilot study investigating the long-term safety and impact of supplementing cysteine and glycine on mitochondrial function, OxS and cognitive function (NCT02348762), we found significant improvements in memory, language and executive function at 4w, 12w and 24w after starting cysteine plus glycine supplementation, and these benefits appear to recede 12w after stopping these supplements. These preliminary data support the exciting possibility that cysteine plus glycine supplementation in elderly humans could improve MCI by improving GSH concentrations, mitochondrial function, and/or improving vascular/endothelial function, and by lowering OxS. The goals of this pilot trial are to (a) establish the relationship in older humans between MCI, GSH deficiency, impaired mitochondrial fuel oxidation and elevated OxS, and (b) determine proof-of- concept of whether supplementing cysteine plus glycine to correct these defects improves MCI in aging.","Elderly humans have an increased risk of dementia which begins as mild defects in memory called mild cognitive impairment – we do not know why this happens and there is no effective treatment. Our group found that supplementing the diets of such elderly humans with protein building blocks called cysteine and glycine improves their cognitive function, and when these supplements are stopped the benefits begin to decline. This exploratory study will find out if this effect is real and identify factors responsible for cognitive impairment (and improvement) by studying a bigger group of elderly humans with mild cognitive impairment who will be evaluated 12 weeks after receiving either cysteine plus glycine or a placebo protein, and a further 12-weeks after stopping these supplement proteins.",

At present the treatment options for COPD are limited and new therapies are needed to treat/prevent progression of COPD. Environmental factors and host response leading to imbalance in the ratio of oxidants to antioxidants, and proteases to antiproteases leading to chronic inflammation and tissue destruction is thought to play crucial role in development and progression of COPD. Quercetin is a plant flavonoid and has potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Quercetin supplementation decreased markers of oxidative stress and inflammation in the plasma of patients with another chronic lung disease, pulmonary sarcoidosis. Quercetin also decreased both oxidative stress and lung inflammation in a preclinical model of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However the impact of quercetin in altering biological signatures in COPD subjects is yet to be determined. The proposed study is conducted in two phases, R61/R33 to define and confirm the biological effects of quercetin in COPD, bioavailability, safety, identification of the appropriate biological signatures which reflect clinical outcomes in COPD. This study will also define the optimal dose of quercetin required for altering biological signatures favorably. This information is necessary to conduct the future clinical trials with quercetin in COPD patients. In R61 Phase, there will be 15 study participants with moderate COPD with FEV1 ranging between 45 and 70 % of predicted and they will be randomized to receive either placebo or quercetin 2000 mg/day for 6 months. In R33 phase there will be 35 COPD subjects, who will be randomized to receive placebo, or one of the 3 quercetin doses, 500, 1000 or 2000 mg/day. Outcome of R61 phase will determine the feasibility of R33 Phase.  In both R61 and R33 phases, all subjects will be characterized using a validated symptom questionnaire, medication and smoking histories, analysis of co-morbidities, and physical examination. All subjects will be asked to go on a low quercetin diet 7 days prior to start of quercetin or placebo supplementation to until the end of trial. Blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) will be collected after 7 days washout period (run-in) and after study drug treatment. Blood will also be collected at 3 months of study drug treatment. Plasma and BAL quercetin levels, markers of inflammation and oxidative stress in blood and BAL will be measured. Pulmonary function, and blood profiles (CBC and CMP) will be performed at run-in and at 3 and 6 months of study drug treatment to assess the safety. Results from these studies will provide information on biological endpoints, safety, bioavailability, and quercetin dosage required to carry out large clinical trials examining the efficacy of quercetin in COPD patients.","PROJECT NARRATIVE Incidence and prevalence of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in the United States is increasing steadily and has recently become a third leading cause of death in the U.S. Quercetin a dietary chemical found in foods such as apples and onions is a natural product with potential anti-COPD properties, but its therapeutic effects in COPD are not studied. This research will help us determine whether quercetin reduces inflammation without having side effects in COPD. This study will also provide necessary information for future treatment studies with quercetin for COPD.",

Few novel therapeutics have been approved for targeting airway smooth muscle relaxation or lung inflammation in the last 40 years. Recent studies found that 60% of moderate asthmatics and 70% of severe asthmatics report using complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) to self-treat their asthma symptoms. The exact mechanism of action of these agents is unclear but may involve attenuation of allergic response (IgE levels), anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, and/or direct effects on airway smooth muscle. Clinical trials with chronic oral ginger therapy have demonstrated safe consumption of 2g per day for 28 days which resulted in the successful detection of the active components of ginger in human plasma and demonstrated an anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory effect in human colon cancer and other inflammatory diseases in vivo and in airway cells in vitro. Thus, our central hypothesis is that ginger will prove efficacious in improving clinical symptoms of asthma and improve the tolerance to an inhaled methacholine bronchoconstrictive challenge due chronic reduction of lung inflammation. We will address two primary biological signatures that reflect the hypothesized mechanism of action of ginger components (i.e. inhibition of phospholipase C); (1) an increased tolerance to inhaled methacholine; and (2) a reduction in exhaled nitric oxide, a measure of lung inflammation. The specific aims are (1) to demonstrate the beneficial effects of oral ginger by an improved tolerance to inhaled methacholine over a 56 day study period; (2) demonstrate an improvement in lung inflammation reflected in reduced exhaled nitric oxide, eosinophilia and serum cytokine levels; (3) demonstrate the bioavailability of metabolites of the active components of ginger shown to have the largest inhibitory effect on phospholipase C; and (4) demonstrate the absence of adverse events and optimal dosing and dosing frequency. This proposal (a) is a pilot study to test a natural botanical substance widely used as a dietary supplement for which sufficient early stage data justifies further clinical testing, (b) measures the bioavailability and the natural product’s mechanism of proposed action will be assessed, (c) stems from compelling preclinical evidence for a potential health benefit, (d) investigates a natural substance widely used by the American public as a dietary supplement, and (e) is performed in a human clinical population with objective outcome measures of a biological signature. This translational study will define the parameters for a large scale clinical trial.","Project Narrative This study is to determine if daily oral ginger improves the management of human asthma.

"1","R61","AT009622-01A1","Exploratory Pilot Studies to Demonstrate Mechanisms of Preventing Antibiotic-Associated Diarrhea and the Role for Probiotics","","31-Aug-2020","FRASER, CLAIRE M.; MERENSTEIN, DANIEL J","UNITED STATES","392910","2018","AT","Abstract Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host. One of the most common indications for probiotic treatment is the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). Unfortunately, the efficacy of many probiotic products used for AAD is not supported by rigorous independent research, and non-evidence-based clinical usage is common. Data from several studies suggest antibiotic-induced disruption of commensal colonic bacteria results in a significant reduction in short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production and a concomitant reduction in Na-dependent fluid absorption, ultimately resulting in AAD. The probiotic strain Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 (BB-12) has been shown to ameliorate a variety of gastrointestinal disease states and is known to produce acetate – the most abundant primary colonic SCFA – at concentrations of up to 50 mM in vitro. Thus, we hypothesize that the concurrent administration of BB-12 with antibiotics will protect against the development of AAD by the ability of BB-12 to both generate acetate directly, and increase other SCFAs through cross-feeding of certain bacteria in the Firmicutes phylum. For example, Clostridium, Eubacterium and Roseburia use acetate to produce butyrate, another common SCFA. The primary aim of the R61 phase (N=60) is to determine if BB-12 can mitigate antibiotic-induced reduction in SCFA concentration, as reflected in fecal acetate levels. We hypothesize that antibiotics will decrease fecal SCFAs, but BB-12 supplementation will protect against antibiotic-induced SCFA reduction, and/or be associated with quicker restoration to baseline SCFA levels as compared to control. Antibiotic administration also lowers total microbial counts and diversity in the gut microbiota, disrupting the homeostasis of the gut ecosystem and allowing colonization by pathogens. The secondary aim uses 16S rDNA profiling to determine if BB-12 inhibits antibiotic-induced disruption of the gut microbiota. We hypothesize that antibiotics will diminish the overall number and diversity of bacterial species present in the fecal microbiota, and concurrent BB-12 supplementation will minimize antibiotic-induced shifts in the microbiota, and/or will be associated with shorter recovery to baseline microbiota composition as compared to control. In the R33 phase (N=108), to further delineate the effects of BB-12 administration on the antibiotic-depleted gut microbiota, we will evaluate the timing of probiotic administration in four randomly assigned groups: 1) BB-12 yogurt consumed at the same time as the antibiotic; 2) control yogurt consumed at the same time as the antibiotic; 3) BB-12 yogurt consumed four hours after the antibiotic; and 4) control yogurt consumed four hours after the antibiotic. Our long-term goal is to determine the impact of BB-12 on a variety of gastrointestinal disease states and ages. Elucidation of the mechanism(s) of action will be integral in shaping the direction of future translational research on probiotic effectiveness.","Project Narrative Probiotics are commonly used to address gastrointestinal issues, such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea. While some studies have shown that probiotics may help prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea, the mechanism of action behind this effect is unclear. This study will generate valuable mechanistic data and help advance probiotic research forward in a systematic, well-accepted manner.",

Mechanisms to explain the relationship are not established, and little is known about the effects of exercise at the cellular level in humans. Observational data suggests that low levels of physical activity are associated with DNA hypermethylation of specific genes in blood, but there is a lack of research on either the direct effects of exercise on DNA methylation in target tissue (colon), or on the amount of exercise necessary to effect these changes. Aberrant DNA methylation of certain genes has been identified in the normal colon of people at risk for colon cancer and appears to reflect a “field cancerization” process, whereby the normal colon is primed for carcinogenesis. Previous research assessed DNA methylation levels using established techniques that were unable to detect low levels. This application is in response to NCI PA-15-163 Exploratory/Developmental Clinical Research Grants in Obesity (R21) which invites grant applications that focus on biomarker effects of weight control methods such as physical activity. Using a novel method that we have developed (MethyLight droplet digital PCR, ddPCR), which accurately detects low levels of DNA methylation in normal colon tissue, we propose to investigate the effects of a 12-month exercise intervention on DNA methylation in 4 candidate genes linked to field cancerization in the colon (EVL, MGMT, p14, and ESR1). Sigmoid colon samples were collected at baseline in 202 initially sedentary men and women aged 40-75 years. Participants were randomized to moderate-to-vigorous intensity aerobic exercise (facility and home, goal 360 minutes/week) intervention (N=51 men, 49 women) or control (no change in exercise; N=51 men, 51 women). In the exercise group, mean exercise over 12 months was 370 min/wk in men (102% of goal) and 295 min/wk in women (82% of goal). 12 month sigmoid colon biopsies were obtained in 187 (93%) [N=48 men, N=43 women in the exercise group, and N=48 men and 48 women in the control group]. Primary analyses will test the intervention effect (intent-to-treat) on levels of DNA methylation of the 4 target genes. Secondary analyses will address effect modification by dose of exercise, weight change and fat mass change (measured by DXA). Exploratory analyses will address: 1) effect modification by sex, colorectal adenoma history, family history of colon cancer, intake of folate and B vitamins; and 2) correlations between baseline DNA methylation of the 4 candidate genes with colon crypt proliferation and apoptosis. The proposed research is highly novel, takes advantage of an existing resource, and will inform future trials testing effects of different types and doses of exercise on genome-wide DNA methylation.","PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will investigate the effects of physical activity on colon DNA methylation in genes related to colon cancer. Excessive DNA methylation is thought to be a risk factor for colon cancer, and no previous study has tested the effect of exercise on DNA methylation in the colon. We will investigate these effects in colon tissue samples from 202 initially sedentary men and women, who have completed an exercise trial.",

It is currently estimated that 33.5 million people worldwide are afflicted with AF. Once established, AF is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, much of which is not impacted by current treatment options. In this competing continuation of the VITAL Rhythm Study, we propose to continue our evaluation of the balance of benefits and risks of marine omega-3 fatty acid (840 mg eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] + docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) and vitamin D3 (2,000 IU/day cholecalciferol) on AF incidence in the setting of an NIH-funded large-scale clinical trial, the VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL). VITAL is an ongoing, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2x2 factorial trial specifically designed to evaluate the efficacy of vitamin D3 and marine omega-3 fatty acid supplements in the primary prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease among 25,874 men (aged 50+ years) and women (aged 55+ years). Benefits and risks with respect to incident AF have been postulated for both of these commonly used supplements based on results from observational studies and short-term secondary prevention randomized trials, but definitive data from a large-scale primary prevention randomized trial are lacking. In this competing continuation, we propose to continue our ancillary study that is in the process of ascertaining and adjudicating AF outcomes within the VITAL trial to test whether long-term treatment (5-years) with omega-3 fatty acid and/or vitamin D3 supplementation has an impact on the incidence AF over 7-years of follow-up in an older population. Case validation of incident AF is ongoing and involves systematic ascertainment of physician diagnoses of AF on annual study questionnaires supplemented by CMS linkage followed by collection of detailed diagnostic information from medical records. The extended follow-up will allow us to fully ascertain and adjudicate the AF endpoints occurring throughout the 5 year VITAL randomized trial and a 2-year post-intervention period and determine whether these agents might have a selective impact on persistent versus paroxysmal forms of AF. Since both agents are known to impact biologic processes involved in atrial structural and electrical remodeling, long-term post-intervention benefits and/or selective benefits on persistent forms of AF are plausible. The additional endpoints that will be adjudicated during the continuation along with the separately funded measurements of plasma 25(OH)D and EPA+DHA assays in the VITAL trial will also allow us to perform important sub-analyses according to sex and baseline nutrient level. In summary, we propose to build on the infrastructure and processes created in the first funding cycle and continue to take advantage of the enormous investment of resources and infrastructure in the VITAL trial to provide a definitive and full assessment of the benefits and risks of these agents on AF incidence and persistence. If beneficial, then these agents would represent the first therapy proven effective for AF prevention.","Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained heart rhythm disturbance and accounts for approximately 15% of strokes and is associated with doubling of mortality. Once established, atrial fibrillation is difficult to treat; and therefore, research directed at prevention of atrial fibrillation is essential. Findings from this proposed study conducted within a large clinical trial will clarify whether vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid supplementation reduces the long term risk of developing AF and progression to more severe forms of AF, providing important data applicable to public health and clinical guidelines for AF prevention.",

The hypothesis underlying this project is that promoting development of a beneficial, protective gut microbiota by co-administration of prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) and iron- sequestering bovine lactoferrin (bLF) during iron supplementation will prevent iron-induced increases of opportunistic enteropathogens that cause infection and inflammation. The proposed research will extend our established strategy of conjoining investigations in vivo with intestinal fermentation and cellular models in vitro. We will conduct a randomized clinical trial in 6 month-old Kenyan infants in conjunction with mechanistic microbiota studies using our established long-term continuous polyfermenter platform inoculated with immobilized fecal microbiota from Kenyan infants. The period from about 6 months to 1 year of age is vital both for iron nutrition and for the establishment of a healthy gut microbiome that promotes immune system development, local immune homeostasis and limits pathogen colonization. Oral iron supplements are associated with a significant 15% increase in the rate of diarrhea in children in malaria-endemic areas. Our most recent studies have shown that prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) can provide partial amelioration of the adverse effects of iron-induced dysbiosis by enhancing the growth of barrier populations of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. We hypothesize that the combination of prebiotic GOS with bovine lactoferrin (bLF), adding iron sequestration, antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities, will provide virtually complete protection against the adverse effects of added iron on the intestinal microbiota. Our research has two specific aims:  (1) to conduct a randomized, controlled double-blind 9-month clinical trial in 6-month old Kenyan infants  comparing the effects on gut microbiome composition among groups receiving in-home fortification  for 6 months with micronutrient powders containing 5 mg iron (as sodium iron EDTA [2.5 mg] and  ferrous fumarate [2.5 mg]) and (i) galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS; 7.5 g), (ii) bovine lactoferrin (bLF, 1.0  g), (iii) GOS (7.5 g) and bLF (1.0 g), and (iv) no GOS or bLF. Each infant will then be followed for an  additional 3 months to determine the longer-term effects of the treatments.  (2) to examine mechanisms of prebiotic GOS and iron-sequestering bLF on microbiota composition,  enteropathogen development, microbiota functions and metabolic activity, and inflammatory potential  in vitro with treatments paralleling those in Specific Aim 1, using immobilized fecal microbiota from  Kenyan infants to inoculate our established long-term continuous polyfermenter intestinal model  (PolyFermS) to mimic Kenyan infant colon conditions, together with cellular studies.","Other Project Information Component: Project Narrative The ultimate goal of this research is to develop a means to safely administer iron supplements to infants in settings with a high infection burden in order to prevent and treat iron deficiency anemia.

While existing techniques such as cryoablation or surgical excision are generally curative, those treatments cause scarring that can be especially disfiguring in patients at high risk for skin cancer (i.e., patients with chronic severe photodamage; immunosuppression due to organ transplantation; or Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome, BCNS). Photodynamic therapy (PDT) combines a photosensitizer (protoporphyrin PpIX, induced by the administration of aminolevulic acid, ALA) with activation by visible light, and is a completely nonscarring technique. PDT is approved by the FDA for field treatment of widespread cutaneous precancers, and in European countries PDT is also approved for treating SCC and BCC. In the U.S. however, approval of PDT for SCC and BCC will require further clinical trials to demonstrate an efficacy similar to existing techniques (destructive ablation). As a new way to increase PDT efficacy, we showed that in animal models of SCC and BCC, transient administration of Vitamin D (VD) prior to ALA-PDT enhances PpIX accumulation and PDT efficacy. The oral (dietary) form of VD (cholecalciferol; D3, given as 10,000 IU/day for 10 days) increases PDT-induced tumor killing by several fold, and is very safe with little risk for inducing hypercalcemia. In this grant, we propose to test this approach in human clinical trials using oral D3 as a neoadjuvant to PDT. Aim 1 will examine the relationship between VD status (serium 25OH-D3) and PDT efficacy for CIS. Subaim 1a is a longitudinal study to test the correlation between serum 25OH-D3 levels and treatment outcomes in routine PDT patients in our clinics, and to examine the predictive value of certain biomarkers (e.g. VDR allelic polymorphisms). Subaim 1b is an interventional trial to assess the benefit of giving neoadjuvant D3 (transient oral D3) prior to PDT. Results from combined D3/PDT treatment (Subaim 1b) will be compared to results after D3 alone (Subaim 1a), stratified by the VD deficiency status. In Aim 2, we will examine the potential benefit of neoadjuvant D3/PDT in patients with BCNS (Gorlin-Goltz syndrome). These patients, who have multiple BCC tumors will receive 3 bimonthly PDT treatments, and rates of tumor shrinkage will be correlated with serum 25OH-D3 levels. Each patient will serve as his/her own control by randomizing the order of the first two PDT treatments, one session to be done with neoadjuvant D3 and the other without. The third PDT treatment will occur after the serum VD level has been adjusted to normal levels with D3 supplements. This approach will allow us to determine whether neoadjuvant D3/PDT can help all patients, even the VD deficient individuals, through customization of D3 dose. Together, we expect this group of clinical trials to establish the foundation for a new treatment modality, i.e., neoadjuvant D3/PDT for skin cancer. The potential benefit for public health is that data showing improved efficacy of PDT with this safe and simple approach will lay the foundation for a nonscarring alternative to surgery for early SCC and BCC tumors.","PROJECT NARRATIVE This is a proposal to develop a new combination regimen that combines Vitamin D3 pretreatment with photodynamic therapy (PDT), as a nonsurgical and non-scarring alternative for the treatment of skin cancer. In clinical trials, we will test the hypothesis that oral Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) will boost the levels of target photosensitizer (protoporphyrin IX) in widespread squamous cell precancers and in basal cell carcinoma, and improve the therapeutic response to PDT. Our study population will comprise patients at high risk, including organ transplant recipients and patients with the Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome.

In addition, an “Acute” DILI protocol with collection of serial early biological samples for mechanistic biomarker studies was developed and implemented. Other network aims included investigation of the role of genetic polymorphisms in DILI susceptibility and outcome, development of improved causality assessment methods, and expansion of the LiverTox website. The University of Michigan team led by Dr. Fontana has played an important role in the design, implementation, and analysis of the primary and ancillary DILIN studies since its inception in 2003. Michigan has not only been a leading enroller in all of the ongoing Registry studies but also provided important leadership in multiple DILIN committees and initiatives. The Michigan team now proposes a series of novel and feasible study aims for the DILIN renewal. The PRIMARY AIM of this proposal is to continue to recruit and enroll high causality adult and pediatric DILI cases into the registry studies for genetic, immunologic, biomarker and mechanistic studies. The Michigan Hepatotoxicity Network has specific plans to increase the enrollment of ethnic minorities via the engagement of hepatologists/ collaborators in southeastern Michigan and elsewhere that care for a large number of African American, Hispanic, and Asian patients. In addition, further development of natural language processing algorithms to search the EMR at the University of Michigan are proposed to facilitate enrollment. Qualitative, quantitative and toxicological studies of the chemical constituents in the herbal and dietary supplement (HDS) products implicated in a growing proportion of DILI cases will be expanded via an ongoing collaboration with the National Center for National Products Research. The SECOND AIM of this proposal is to conduct pilot/ feasibility clinical trials to improve the outcomes of patients with severe acute DILI and those at risk for developing chronic DILI. Proposed study designs include a 12 week course of a simple and safe, orally administered anti-inflammatory or anti-oxidant agent (e.g. budesonide, SAMe, vitamin E) in selected patients with severe acute DILI at risk for adverse outcomes. In addition, 12 to 24 week studies of a safe and effective orally administered anti- cholestatic agent such as an ileal apical bile salt transport inhibitor that may reduce serum bile acids are proposed for subjects at risk of chronic DILI. Lastly, prospective studies of magnetic resonance elastography and MRCP imaging are proposed to improve our understanding of the severity and natural history of DILI. The THIRD AIM of this proposal is to further expand the LiverTox website to include additional chapters on HDS DILI, develop and implement a computerized causality assessment instrument, and assemble working committees to insure that the website content remains up to date and pertinent. Finally, additional collaborations between DILIN and the US FDA and other regulatory agencies are proposed to enhance the pharmacovigilance capabilities of DILIN for new causes of DILI and temporal changes over time.","PROJECT NARRATIVE The University of Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network proposes to improve our understanding of the etiologies, risk factors, and outcomes of DILI via the continued enrollment of adult and pediatric patients including targeted enrollment of ethnic minority patients that will help determine if there are racial differences in DILI susceptibility and outcomes via analysis of collected biological samples, DNA, liver tissue, and clinical data. Pilot/ feasibility clinical trials of simple, safe and mechanistically based treatments for patients with severe acute DILI and those at risk for developing chronic DILI are also proposed. Finally, further development and enhancement of the LiverTox website is proposed to include additional chapters on HDS DILI, development and implementation of a computerized diagnostic instrument, and expansion of the pharmacovigilance capabilities of DILIN.",

Even though it is well known that insulin resistance and chronic inflammation lead to HTN and accelerate vascular disease in patients with T2DM, very little is known about the mechanisms by which these risk factors promote HTN and CVD. Vitamin D deficiency in patients with T2DM is almost twice that of non-diabetics, and most of the randomized clinical trials evaluating vitamin D supplementation in uncomplicated T2DM have demonstrated BP reductions, suggesting a possible effect in this population. Thus, the goal of this application is to identify the molecular mechanisms by which vitamin D deficiency promotes HTN in the setting of T2DM. Our preliminary data indicates that mice with macrophage- specific deletion of the VDR (KODMAC) were hypertensive with increased systemic renin, activation of the macrophage renin angiotensin system (RAS) in the aorta, and renal macrophage infiltration into the juxtaglomerular (JG) apparatus, the main source of renin production. Peritoneal macrophages from KODMAC or their media activated JG cell renin production via macrophage secretion of miR106b. This effect was blunted by lack of macrophage ER stress-regulated (C/EBP) homologous protein (CHOP). Similar effects were found with macrophages from vitamin D-deficient mice or from vitamin D-deficient patients with T2DM. Thus, we hypothesize that vitamin D-deficient macrophages increase systemic renin and hypertension in T2DM via increased secretion of miR-106b, stimulating renin secretion by JG cells, and/or via macrophage RAS-dependent mechanism. To test this hypothesis, Aim 1 will determine whether bone marrow (BM) transplant from miR-106b-/- or CHOP-/- into vitamin D-deficient mice improves HTN and decreases systemic renin. In Aim 2, we will evaluate whether BM transplant from Renin 1c-/- into vitamin D-deficient mice improves HTN and decreases systemic renin. In Aim 3, we will also assess the role of these inflammatory mechanisms of HTN in patients with T2DM and vitamin D deficiency by correlating changes in plasma miR-106b levels with changes in blood pressure after vitamin D supplementation (Aim 3a) and by testing whether monocytes or serum from vitamin D-deficient diabetics with HTN induce JG cell renin secretion via miR-106b (Aim 3b). This proposal will identify the mechanisms by which vitamin D deficiency regulates the innate immune system to induce systemic renin production and HTN in type 2 diabetes and thus, provide new therapeutic targets for these pervasive diseases.  ","PROJECT NARRATIVE  It is well-recognized that chronic inflammation integrates insulin resistance with hypertension and cardiovascular complications, but the mechanisms are undefined. We found that cell-specific deletion of the macrophage vitamin D receptor in mice is sufficient to cause renin-dependent hypertension, which corrects with bone marrow (BM) transplantation of cells with intact VDR. This study will determine whether macrophage RAS activation and/or miR106b secretion are critical mechanism by which vitamin D-deficiency increased systemic renin and induce hypertension in a mouse model of insulin resistance and in patients with type 2 diabetes.  ",

During our initial period of funding, we launched VITAL-DKD as an ancillary study to the parent Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial (VITAL). Specifically, to the large (N=25,875) and simple parent VITAL trial, we added kidney outcomes and accompanying clinical data to a subset of 1,322 VITAL participants with prevalent type 2 diabetes to test the effects of vitamin D3 and omega-3 fatty acids on the clinical manifestations of DKD. In this competitive renewal application, we propose to extend follow-up of our VITAL DKD ancillary study from 2 to 5 years, add measurements to stored specimens to more comprehensively evaluate treatment effects, and assess intermediate cardiovascular outcomes that complement our primary renal outcome. Our approach builds on our recruited study population and completed measurements and leverages the infrastructure of the parent VITAL trial, which is funded by the NIH to provide study treatments and basic data acquisition through 2017. We have recruited a diverse study population with type 2 diabetes that has or is at risk of DKD and is maintaining excellent adherence to study medications. To extend our study, our experienced study team will apply methods developed and successfully implemented during our initial funding period.

These products are now among the most popular dietary supplements with consumers. However, because traditional probiotic use has relied on dairy carrier matrices, the impact and equivalency of probiotics in dietary supplement formats are not well understood. This Administrative Supplement proposal is affiliated with my R01 project (1R01HD088428-01A1) investigating the efficacy and safety of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (B. lactis) BB-12 (BB-12) in preventing pediatric antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). Although prevention of AAD is one of the most common indications for probiotic treatment, the efficacy of many probiotic products used for AAD is not supported by rigorous independent research. In the R01 human study, patients will consume BB-12 in yogurt during antibiotic treatment and will be observed for the frequency and duration of diarrhea and adverse outcomes. A secondary hypothesis of the R01 is that administration of antibiotics will alter the gut microbiome and that BB-12 in yogurt will mitigate the disturbance that antibiotics might cause. However, because this is a human study, it is difficult to investigate the molecular mechanisms behind BB-12 effects in the gut and to involve costly comparisons of different carrier matrices. Therefore, this supplement will use a mouse model to address whether BB-12 consumed in yogurt is more efficacious than when given as a dietary supplement. By examining for changes to the fecal microbiota and intestinal environment following antibiotic and probiotic treatment, we will begin to elucidate the specific molecular mechanisms by which probiotics can reduce the risk for AAD. Primary Aim: To quantify colonic SCFA levels in mice receiving antibiotics alone or in combination with BB-12 in yogurt or supplement (powder) format. Secondary Aim: To assess the composition of the intestinal microbiota in mice using 16S rRNA profiling before, during, and after antibiotic consumption in mice receiving antibiotics alone or in combination with BB-12 in either yogurt or supplement (powder) format. Tertiary Aim: To assess the level of SCFA sensing in intestinal tissues in mice receiving antibiotics alone or in combination with BB-12 in either yogurt or supplement (powder) format. Primary Hypothesis: Administration of BB-12 in yogurt is more effective than capsule format at mitigating antibiotic-induced changes to the gut microbiome to prevent the development of AAD. Objective: To better understand probiotic carrier format in the prevention of AAD. Clinically, probiotics have been shown to significantly prevent AAD, but the mechanistic basis for the best mode of delivery to the digestive tract is unclear. Our long-term goal is to determine the impact of BB-12 on a variety of gastrointestinal disease states and ages, through high-level independent research. To improve our interpretation of the outcomes of our current Phase II study (R01), we need to first perform more mechanistic studies to understand how BB-12 can prevent AAD in either yogurt or dietary supplement format.","Probiotics have been shown clinically to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea, but the mechanistic basis for the best mode of delivery to the digestive tract is unclear.

Neural tube defects (NTDs) are among the most common and serious of all birth defects affecting 0.5-1 per 1,000 US newborns, yet their complex etiology remains poorly understood (Wallingford et al., 2013). It is well established that pre-pregnancy supplementation with folic acid can reduce the risk of NTDs, but the underlying mechanism of this beneficial effect is unclear. Approximately 30% of NTDs cannot be prevented by maternal periconceptional folate supplementation. Our preliminary data showed that rare mutations in planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway could increase the risk of NTDs, while mutagens such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were enriched in the placentas of NTDs fetuses/infants. We hypothesized that NTDs are caused by combinations of rare multiple mutations. Higher mutation rates results in a higher NTDs prevalence. It is possible that folic acid can prevent NTDs by reducing the mutation rate. Furthermore, we hypothesize that paternal supplementation with folic acid can further reduce NTD rates. We have a unique opportunity to evaluate folate supplement effect on mutation rate by leveraging previously collected biological samples from NTD patients and controls from several distinct cohorts. Additionally, we propose to use mouse models to better understand the relationship between folate and mutation rates in vivo. The results of this study will provide an explanation of how folate prevents NTDs, and will reveal novel pathways for intervention on folate-resistant NTDs. Hence, the successful completion of the proposed studies is likely to have substantial impact on our understanding of conditions that affect ~6% of births worldwide and constitute one of the major healthcare concerns for the youngest members of society.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Folic acid supplementation has proven to be an effective intervention in the prevention of neural tube defects (NTDs). Despite decades of investigation, it is far from clear how this beneficial effects is achieved, and why over 30% of remaining cases of NTDs are not folate responsive. We hypothesize that folic acid reduces the mutation rates, thereby limiting combinations of rare mutations that have been associated with increase NTD risks. We believe that paternal supplementation with folic acid can further reduce NTD prevalence. These hypotheses will be tested in human NTD samples as well as in newly developed mouse model systems.",

Human association studies are supported by emerging mouse models that provide evidence of causality. In the parent R01HL122995 we describe one of these models and propose to use it to study mechanisms. We hypothesize that in utero exposure to diesel exhaust particles (DEP) promotes asthma susceptibility through aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-dependent priming of natural killer (NK) cells. AhR is a transcriptional factor that is activated by DEP-derived polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). In R01HL122995 we link PAH and AhR to induction of type-2/3 cytokines in offspring NK cells. In the Administrative Supplement we would like to go one step further and propose to block this pathway through supplementation of maternal diet with nicotinamide riboside (NR). NR is a naturally-occurring compound that is biochemically related to niacin (vitamin B3). NR and niacin are precursors of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). NR is considered superior to niacin because it is more potent in raising NAD+ and devoid of niacin side effects. NAD+, the end product of niacin/NR transformations, is an important coenzyme and cosubstrate that drives many fundamental cellular processes, including ATP generation, DNA repair, mitochondrial maintenance and protection from cell death. The rationale to use a NAD+-boosting compound as an antidote for PAH/DEP in our model comes from studies showing that 1) PAH and AhR deplete NAD+, 2) NAD+ depletion significantly contributes to effects of PAH and AhR, 3) Maintenance of normal NAD+ levels is important in prevention of inflammation, which is consistent with the homeostatic role of NAD+. NAD+ is an essential and rate-limiting cosubstrate of sirtuin enzymes. When NAD+ levels are normal, sirtuins deacetylate and, thereby, inactivate GATA3 and NF-B, precluding transcription of type-2/3 cytokine genes. If NAD+ levels decline, rates of sirtuin-catalyzed reactions decrease. Sirtuin inactivation results in acetylation and activation of GATA3 and NF-B, leading to cytokine production. Described studies collectively imply that NAD+ depletion and sirtuin inactivation are important mechanisms linking PAH/AhR with transcription of type-2/3 immunity genes. We hypothesize that maternal intake of the NAD+ precursor NR will reverse DEP-induced and AhR-mediated type-2/3 re-programming of offspring NK cells and, therefore, block transgenerational transmission of asthma susceptibility. The Specific Aim of the Administrative Supplement is to test the effectiveness of maternal NR intake in prevention of DEP- mediated NK cell activation and induction of asthma predisposition in offspring. To address this Aim, we plan to administer NR to DEP-exposed mothers and examine development of asthma predisposition in offspring. We will also measure type-2/3 cytokine production by offspring NK cells. Finally, we will measure NAD+, activity of sirtuins and acetylation of NF-B and GATA3 in these cells.","Project Narrative This project, if successful, will identify nicotinamide riboside as a new prevention strategy for diesel exhaust- associated asthma.",

We have previously conducted two Phase I, safety trials and as per FDA requirements, are now proposing a Phase II trial that will examine efficacy and monitor safety of BB-12 in preventing AAD. The investigational product delivers a stable high dosage of BB-12, consistent with the findings of a Cochrane review for preventing AAD using other strains studied outside of the United States. To explore possible mechanisms responsible for BB-12 effects in ameliorating AAD, we will also study the gut microbiota composition and function by collecting five fecal samples at multiple time points from all participants.

However, due to the heterogeneous nature of critical illness, patient-specific factors likely play a major role in determining response to vit D3. We will use a precision medicine approach to investigate the clinical, genetic, and biochemical factors that determine response to vit D3 administration in critical illness.  This proposal is an ancillary study to the NHLBI-funded Vitamin D to Improve Outcomes by Leveraging Early Treatment (VIOLET) trial, an ongoing, multicenter RCT that is enrolling 3000 critically ill patients at high risk of ARDS and death. Patients are randomly assigned to receive a single enteral dose of 540,000 I.U. of vit D3 or placebo to test whether vit D3 reduces 90-day mortality and acute organ injury. VIOLET is archiving plasma and DNA from all 3000 patients on day 0, and plasma on day 3 from the first 300 patients. We propose to collect plasma on day 3 from an additional 500 patients (Aim 1) and to leverage existing samples (Aims 2 and 3) to test the following hypotheses.

Changes in age demographics in the U.S. predict progressive increases in these disorders without effective, evidence-based interventions. The age-related increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP) is a major factor driving the increased risk of these disorders in later middle-aged and older (MA/O) adults. This increase in SBP is due primarily to stiffening of the large elastic arteries, as indicated by increased carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (CFPWV), which reflects stiffening of the aorta. Aortic stiffening with aging is mediated by structural and functional (increased vascular smooth muscle tone) changes in the arterial wall stimulated by oxidative stress and chronic low-grade inflammation.  New BP guidelines describe a casual (resting) SBP of 120-129 mmHg as “elevated” and SBP of 130-139 mmHg as “stage 1 hypertension”, as these levels account for much of the increased risk of CVD and other BP-influenced disorders of aging. Importantly, ~50% of adults age >50 have SBP within these ranges. The first-line treatment for lowering SBP in these ranges is lifestyle-based therapy. In this context, we have shown that caloric restriction (CR) reduces SBP and CFPWV in older mice and in overweight/obese MA/O humans, but adherence is poor and CR reduces muscle and bone mass. As a result, we have since shown that boosting NAD+ bioavailability to stimulate SIRT-1, a “CR mimetic” approach, reduces CFPWV and oxidative stress in old mice, and we recently took the first step in translating these findings in a small pilot study of MA/O adults (n=24). We found that supplementation with nicotinamide riboside, a natural, commercially available precursor of NAD+ and novel CR mimetic, was well-tolerated and increased NAD+ bioavailability in the overall group, and reduced SBP (-8 mmHg) and CFPWV in a subgroup (n=13) with baseline SBP of 120-139 mmHg.  Here we propose a randomized, placebo controlled, double-blind, single-site phase IIa clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of oral nicotinamide riboside (500 mg capsules 2x/day; NIAGEN®; ChromaDex Inc.) for 3 months vs. placebo (n=59/group) for decreasing SBP and aortic stiffness in MA/O men and women (50-79 years) with SBP in the elevated/stage 1 hypertension (120-139 mmHg) range.

Recently, prenatal supplements with added lutein and zeaxanthin have entered the American market with the stated intentions of enhancing infant visual and neural development. Although clinical trials were never performed to support this contention, it is physiologically plausible from the neonate's perspective because these dietary carotenoids are selectively concentrated in human ocular and neural tissue in utero, especially during the third trimester of pregnancy, and there is increasing evidence that lutein and zeaxanthin not only protect against macular degeneration in the elderly, but they may also function to enhance contrast sensitivity, decrease glare disability, and increase visual acuity and cognition throughout life. The macular carotenoid pigment is detectable at birth, and levels increase with age at a time when they can contribute to visual function and foveal development. From the mother's perspective, the last trimester of pregnancy is a time when she must transfer some of her carotenoid stores to the developing infant, potentially putting her at risk for depletion systemically and in her ocular tissues. Because of the importance to the long-term health of both mothers and their infants, a randomized, controlled study using state-of-the-art quantitative assessment tools is indicated; however, before embarking on a potentially very large multi-center clinical trial, it is appropriate to conduct a smaller-scale pilot study to explore the feasibility of recruitment and retention and to develop the information to properly power future studies. Currently, all available data on the role of carotenoids in prenatal health are cross-sectional or observational, The proposed study is designed to test the hypotheses that: [a] the third trimester of pregnancy is indeed a period of maternal systemic and ocular carotenoid depletion; [b] prenatal supplementation with commercially available prenatal supplements containing lutein and zeaxanthin will counteract this reduction; [c] the enhanced maternal carotenoid status associated with prenatal carotenoid supplementation will increase systemic carotenoid levels and macular pigment in their newborn infants. This R21 study will provide necessary preliminary data to design and power future, larger-scale prospective clinical trials with further optimized formulations to determine whether prenatal and postnatal carotenoid supplementation can have beneficial effects on maternal visual function and on infant visual and cognitive development in normal and high-risk pregnancies.

Despite compelling evidence implicating vitamin D in CRC, critical questions remain about whether these findings reflect a true causal relationship, and what the biological mech- anisms of vitamin D activity are. Our central hypothesis is that vitamin D supplementation to achieve sufficient levels of 25(OH)D leads to improved survival in CRC patients and influences several neoplastic pathways that can be exploited as biomarkers of efficacy and targets for novel treatment strategies. We will test this hypothe- sis within two novel randomized clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation: a) a phase II double-blind random- ized trial of high- versus low-dose vitamin D3 in combination with chemotherapy in patients with metastatic CRC, and b) a randomized trial of preoperative high-dose vitamin D3 versus placebo in patients with resectable colon cancer for examination of vitamin D biology in fresh human tumor tissue. We will also lever- age a rich prospective cohort of metastatic CRC patients enrolled in a completed NCI-sponsored phase III trial of chemotherapy (CALGB/SWOG 80405) to further define and validate biomarkers of vitamin D action. In Aim 1, we will determine the impact of supplemental vitamin D on survival of CRC patients, test distinct hypotheses about the vitamin D dose-response relationship, and explore biomarkers of vitamin D status, response, and efficacy. We will investigate whether circulating levels of vitamin D binding protein and tumoral expression of vitamin D receptor, 1α-hydroxylase, and 24-hydroxylase are associated with improved survival within our ran- domized trials, and whether these markers modify the relationship between vitamin D and patient outcome. In Aim 2, we will conduct a precision medicine analysis of vitamin D to elucidate the mechanistic basis for its anti- tumor activity in CRC. We will explore the impact of vitamin D supplementation on tumoral markers of inflam- mation, lymphocytic infiltrates, and inflammatory gene signatures in surgical colectomy specimens from pa- tients treated with high-dose preoperative vitamin D3 versus placebo. We will also perform next generation se- quencing and Nanostring analysis of tumors from CRC patients with high- versus low vitamin D status to identi- fy unique genetic and transcriptional signatures associated with vitamin D-mediated carcinogenesis. In sum- mary, this translational proposal leverages innovative randomized trials of vitamin D to take the next critical steps in understanding vitamin D activity and biology in CRC. Our findings will confirm causality, provide new insights into biomarkers of vitamin D activity, and lead to potential inclusion of vitamin D into standard therapy – including immunotherapy – with the ultimate goal of improving the survival of patients with CRC.","PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the U.S., and may plausibly be linked to vitamin D deficiency. Abundant preclinical and epide- miologic data link lower levels of vitamin D to increased risk of and mortality from colorectal cancer; this is par- ticularly relevant given increasing rates of vitamin D deficiency in the U.S., as well as profound racial disparities in vitamin D status and colorectal cancer incidence and mortality. In an era of expensive and often toxic anti- neoplastic drugs, vitamin D therefore represents an attractive and accessible treatment option for patients of all races and sociodemographic groups with respect to both safety and cost.",

Health effects associated with WSP include acute bronchitis, asthma exacerbation, pneumonia, cough and systemic inflammation in in healthy persons and those with asthma. Cardiovascular effects have also been reported with WSP exposure. WSP from wildland fires can cause abrupt increases in ambient air PM 2.5 levels, and avoidance of rapidly increasing PM air pollution is not feasible as many residents cannot leave the burn region, and wildland firefighters move into wildland fire sites, often for several consecutive days. As avoidance of PM is not feasible in these settings, there is a clear unmet need for interventions to reduce adverse health effects caused by acute WSP exposure. Our team has developed gamma tocopherol (gT), an isoform of vitamin E with robust anti-inflammatory actions, as a chemopreventive intervention for inflammation caused by environmental contaminants. Our animal studies show that gT inhibits allergen, ozone and endotoxin-induced airway inflammation. Our human phase I studies show that gT decreases inflammatory response of circulating monocytes, decreases nitrosative stress, and inhibits neutrophil (PMN) influx to the airway in vivo after endotoxin challenge. Thus, gT supplementation is an attractive nutritional/nutraceutical approach to decreasing the adverse health effects of inhaled WSP. We have also developed a 500µg/m3 WSP exposure protocol which induces both airway and systemic increases in PMNs in human volunteers. Using this challenge protocol, we will undertake a randomized, placebo-controlled study to determine if of supplementation with 1200 mg of on WSP-induced airway and systemic PMN increases in healthy and asthmatic volunteers. Exploratory endpoints will include non-specific bronchial reactivity (NSBR), and cardiovascular responses reported to be impacted by PM exposure. These studies will also allow us to compare responses of allergic asthmatic (AA) and healthy volunteers (HV) to determine if atopy or other facets of asthma modify risk for inflammatory response to WSP. This study will be the first to test a specific nutritional supplement as a chemopreventive intervention for WSP-induced inflammation in either AAs or NVs, and to specifically compare the response of these groups to WSP-induced inflammation.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we will examine the ability of supplementation with gamma tocopherol (gT), a form of naturally occurring vitamin E, to prevent lung and systemic inflammation following exposure to wood smoke particles (WSP) in healthy and asthmatic volunteers. WSPs from wildfires are a major contributor to air pollution. Many people cannot escape areas where there is increased fire related WSP air pollution, so safe and inexpensive treatments (such as gT) are urgently needed to prevent environmentally-induced lung disease.",

In this application, we propose to examine the role of the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin, and its primary regulator vitamin D, in lung function impairment, respiratory infections and acute exacerbations of COPD as well as evaluate the effect of oral vitamin D supplementation on lung cathelicidin levels in humans. Cathelicidin has bactericidal and inflammatory activities in the lung and is regulated by vitamin D levels. Our hypothesis is that reduced cathelicidin levels are associated with accelerated lung function decline though a pathway partially mediated by increased infections and COPD exacerbations. We hypothesize the effect of cathelicidin on lung function is greater in those with vitamin D insufficiency and that oral vitamin D supplementation will raise cathelicidin levels in the pulmonary compartment, thereby restoring lung cathelicidin deficiency. Specifically, through longitudinal investigation nested within an ongoing cohort study of urban, predominantly African-American individuals at high risk for development of OLDs, we will characterize the rate of lung function decline in 380 participants followed with serial spirometry measures for up to six years. Baseline and repeated measures of cathelicidin and vitamin D will be examined as independent predictors of lung function decline and respiratory infections. Separately, using longitudinal data from 2100 participants enrolled in the Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study (SPIROMICS) study with established COPD, baseline measures of blood cathelicidin and vitamin D will be examined as an independent predictor of longitudinal FEV1 decline and COPD exacerbations over three years. In both cohorts, concurrent vitamin D measurements will permit evaluation of antecedent and modifier on the cathelicidin-lung outcomes relationships. Finally, we will measure blood and lung lavage cathelicidin levels in 40 vitamin D insufficient individuals before and after eight weeks of oral vitamin D supplementation to determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on cathelicidin levels. Completion of these aims will provide a robust determination of the role of cathelicidin in lung function decline and adverse pulmonary outcomes in unique populations of at-risk and diseased individuals. Moreover, the aims of this application directly or indirectly wor towards ultimately understanding if a readily measurable blood marker, cathelicidin, can inform who may benefit from vitamin D supplementation to prevent chronic lung disease. The results from this application would lead to a therapeutic intervention study that will provide further opportunities to improve our understanding of the relationship between vitamin D, cathelicidin and lung function.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal will evaluate a potential mechanism of increased risk of lung function impairment, as well as determine if vitamin D replacement can alter this pathway.

It is estimated that obesity is second only to smoking as a cause of premature preventable death. This is largely due to the comorbidities associated with obesity including metabolic syndrome, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Yet, very little progress has been made in the development of treatments to prevent obesity and its comorbidities, and the mechanistic link between obesity and development of comorbidities is not completely understood. Several studies have shown that obese rodents develop tissue vitamin A deficiency, with tissue retinoid concentrations decreasing by a stunning 75-90%, suggesting profound metabolic dysregulation. Findings in cell systems and animal models demonstrate that retinoids regulate adipocyte differentiation and glucose and lipid metabolism and, further, that decreased retinoid concentrations are associated with progressive obesity, insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. Thus, aggregate preclinical data suggest that altered vitamin A metabolism may contribute directly to obesity progression and the development of obesity-related co-morbidities. Critically, the mechanisms underlying this dysregulated vitamin A metabolism remain poorly understood, and the relevance of these preclinical findings to human obesity is unclear. A central premise of this proposal is that altered vitamin A metabolism in obesity is a result of increased inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6 and TNF in metabolic tissues, which regulate the expression of the retinoid metabolizing enzymes CYP26, LRAT, ALDH1A and RDH in adipocytes and various liver cell types. We further hypothesize that this dysregulation of vitamin A metabolism occurs in human obesity as well as in animal models. We will test our hypotheses in two specific aims: 1) to identify the enzymes and the key regulatory signals that control all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) concentrations and vitamin A metabolic flux in human liver and adipose tissue, and 2) to establish whether adipose tissue and liver vitamin A metabolomes are altered in obese humans. We will use our state-of-the-art mass spectrometry methods, innovative metabolic flux experiments and kinetic modeling in specific cell types to characterize the key enzymes that metabolize retinoids in liver and adipose tissue and determine how the activity of these enzymes is altered in obesity. To determine whether tissue retinoids are altered in human obesity, we will conduct a cross sectional clinical study comparing visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue, liver and serum vitamin A metabolomes in obese and non-obese subjects. The proposed studies will lay the foundation for understanding the regulation of vitamin A metabolism in human liver and adipose tissue and for determing how vitamin A metabolism may become dysregulated in obesity contributing to progressive obesity and its co-morbidities in humans. The results will generate unprecedented insight into human retinoid biology and ultimately could lead to targeted therapeutic interventions designed to restore tissue retinoid signaling as a novel strategy for the treatment of obesity and its sequela.","The obesity epidemic is a major public health burden and incurs annual healthcare costs in excess of $150 million in the U.S. alone. Rodent models suggest that obesity is associated with significant tissue vitamin A deficiency which, in turn, contributes to progressive obesity and development of obesity-associated co- morbidities. This project will help define the mechanisms regulating tissue-specific vitamin A metabolism in humans, determine the relevance of preclinical findings to human obesity, and establish whether tissue retinoids may be potential novel treatment targets for obesity and its associated co-morbidities.",

These are among the most bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms – associated with worse mental health, poor physical well-being, and increased falls, fractures, and nursing home placement. Despite treatment options, many patients do not become symptom-free and discontinue medications due to side effects or perceived inefficacy. Attention is shifting to possible prevention and early treatment strategies. Potential benefits of vitamin D may extend to several relevant organ systems, and vitamin D could act via multiple pathways to reduce lower urinary tract symptoms by improving detrusor activity and decreasing inflammation. Indeed, evidence emerging from epidemiologic studies indicate that higher vitamin D levels are associated with decreased risk for OAB and UI.  In this revision application, we will leverage two large, complementary epidemiologic studies – the VITamin D and omegA-3 TriaL (VITAL, n=25,000 women and men) and the observational Nurses’ Health Studies (n>100,000 women) -- to conduct a rich exploration of vitamin D and OAB, as well as UUI. In this revision, we extend research to both OAB and UUI, increasing clinical relevance by broadening the outcomes (previously only UI) while focusing on symptoms related to detrusor contractility. We also improve innovation by targeting research in: (1) African Americans (n=2300 in NHS, n=5200 in VITAL), who disproportionately suffer from OAB and UUI, and have higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency; and in (2) obese adults (n=34,000 in NHS, n=7200 in VITAL), who are at higher risk of OAB and UUI, and have lower bioavailability of vitamin D as it is retained in adipose tissue. Our main Aims are to: 1) assess if vitamin D3 supplementation decreases OAB and UUI in VITAL, where participants have been assigned to 2000IU/day of vitamin D or placebo for five years, and in NHS, where observational data are available on a large range of doses, from <400 IU to >800 and >1000 IU/day; and 2) to prospectively assess if higher plasma 25(OH)D levels at baseline are related to a decreased incidence and progression of UUI in the NHS. In VITAL, where an estimated 50% of participants had 25(OH)D<30ng/mL at baseline, we propose to collect data on OAB and UI symptoms at year 5 by adding new questions on urgency, frequency, nocturia and urine leakage at the close of the trial. The NHS already includes extensive UUI data, and we will newly measure baseline vitamin D levels from stored blood samples and add OAB questions in upcoming follow-up periods. The large samples of African American and of obese adults in these cohorts uniquely enable important and novel research. The expected outcomes will be to provide exciting new knowledge regarding vitamin D as a possible convenient, low-cost intervention for preventing OAB and UUI symptoms and progression among women and men, specifically targeting high-risk subgroups of African Americans and obese adults.","PROJECT NARRATIVE Overactive bladder (OAB) can occur with or without urgency urinary incontinence (UUI). OAB and UUI affects the lives of millions of men and women and is very costly. Emerging evidence from epidemiologic studies link higher vitamin D levels with lower rates of OAB and UUI. With this proposal, our goal is to understand the relationship of vitamin D supplementation compared to placebo on OAB and UUI symptoms, especially in high- risk subgroups. We will also evaluate how supplementation may improve new-onset OAB and UUI over time.",

Gut microbial composition and function are amenable to modification by diet. Flaxseed (FS), a whole food commonly consumed as a dietary adjuvant for several purported health effects, is a rich source of the polyphenolic lignans. Structurally similar to endogenous estrogens, lignans have been most widely studied for phytoestrogen effects; however, anti- inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antioxidant effects have also been reported, primarily in animal and cell models. Importantly, to become physiologically available to humans, plant lignans require metabolism to enterolignans by a consortium of gut microbial community members, but not all individuals are enterolactone producers. Plant lignans are converted by the gut bacteria to the primary circulating enterolignan enterolactone (ENL) which can be measured in most body fluids. ENL has been inversely associated with several inflammation-related chronic diseases and, as a bacterial metabolite, has significant potential to impact health. Using existing data and specimens from a completed flaxseed intervention study in healthy, postmenopausal African American (AA) and non-Hispanic White (NHW) women that investigated the impact of the intervention on gut microbial communities, lignan metabolism, and steroid hormone metabolism, we will accomplish the following Aims: 1) In the overall study sample, determine associations between gut microbial community profiles, circulating metabolic profiles, and circulating inflammation-related cytokines for women who are high vs low ENL producers; 2) In a subset of women (n=80; 40 high producers [20 AA, 20 NHW], 40 low producers [20 AA, 20 NHW]), utilize metatranscriptomics to a) characterize the impact of the FS intervention on pre- and postintervention microbial gene expression, b) determine associations between microbial gene expression and circulating metabolites and inflammation-related cytokines, and c) how these associations differ by producer status and race; and 3) In the subset of women in Aim 2, utilize fecal metabolomics to characterize microbial metabolic profiles pre- and post-intervention, and determine associations with microbial gene expression (metatranscriptomics), circulating metabolites, and inflammation- related cytokines. We hypothesize that the FS intervention will modify microbial gene expression and metabolic pathways related to chronic low grade inflammation and these pathways will differ by producer status and for AA and NHW women. The proposed study offers a unique opportunity to characterize changes in microbial function and subsequent modification of circulating metabolic profiles related to chronic low grade inflammation in a generous sample of AA and NHW white women. Given the higher incidence of inflammation related chronic disease in AA, this study will contribute significantly to our understanding of the role of the microbiome in inflammatory metabolic processes.","The proposed research has potential to identify biologic signatures by which dietary components could be leveraged into interventions or treatments to reduce chronic inflammation and immune phenotypes associated with chronic disease.",

Adequate nutritional status in CF, including maintenance of skeletal muscle (fat-free) mass, is tightly correlated with lung function and survival in this population. However, relatively little research exists to guide evidence- based optimal dietary recommendations regarding specific nutrients and food patterns in CF. Recent advances in high-resolution metabolomics (HRM) provide a unique opportunity to broadly explore metabolism and underlying pathways relevant to nutrition, disease exacerbation, and treatment in CF. Preliminary HRM data from Dr. Alvarez's K01-supported research (K01 DK102851) indicated an enhanced catabolic state in adults with CF, as evidenced by dysregulation of plasma amino acids and lipids and their metabolic intermediates. The data also suggested that high-dose vitamin D3--previously shown to improve clinical outcomes--may mitigate catabolism in these subjects during an acute pulmonary exacerbation. Furthermore, key clinical outcomes before vitamin D3 intervention, such as lung function, were correlated with metabolic pathways directly linked to dietary intake and nutritional status. The purpose of this R03 study is to use plasma HRM with advanced bioinformatics to: 1) identify specific nutrient-related metabolic processes that differ as a function of clinical status and are linked to important clinical outcomes; and 2) confirm an anti-catabolic/pro-anabolic effect of high-dose vitamin D3 in a completed prospective, randomized controlled trial. The overall goal of this project is to obtain new insight into the CF catabolic state during acute illness and recovery that will inform the design of future nutritional interventions to prevent depletion of fat-free mass. Specific aims are to use plasma HRM to: 1) compare the catabolic state of adults with CF during clinical stability vs. during acute pulmonary exacerbation, using healthy adults and adults with non-CF bronchiectasis as controls; 2) investigate whether high-dose vitamin D3 has long-term anti-catabolic/pro-anabolic effects in adults with CF initially hospitalized for an acute pulmonary exacerbation; and 3) conduct metabolome-wide association studies in Aim 1 and 2 CF subjects to determine if nutrient-related pathways are linked to convalescence and clinical outcomes over time. This R03 grant, in combination with Dr. Alvarez's K01 training, will accelerate her transition to independence and will provide strong preliminary data for subsequent R01 studies.

Thiamine deficiency diseases, notably wet and dry beriberi, and Wernicke's encephalopathy, a severe neurological syndrome associated with thiamine deficiency, are associated with many diseases and conditions that result from under-nutrition and malabsorption of thiamine (e.g. alcoholism, bariatric surgery) or hyper-metabolic states (e.g., cancer). However mechanistic studies following a recent and disastrous clinical drug trial (that was terminated because the drug, fedratinib, led to Wernicke's encephalopathy) highlighted the importance of pharmaceutical agents as contributors to thiamine deficiency. That is, fedratinib was shown to be a potent inhibitor of thiamine absorption via the thiamine transporter, SLC19A3. In this research application, we bring together NIH and USDA nutrition supported researchers, in response to PAR-15-024. In particular, we propose to test the hypotheses that commonly used medications inhibit SLC19A3-mediated intestinal absorption of thiamine resulting in drug-vitamin interactions. Secondly, we propose that these drug-thiamine interactions produce a detectable metabolic signature that relates to reduction in the activity of enzymes that are dependent on thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), the active metabolite of thiamine. Our hypotheses are based on exciting preliminary studies in our laboratories demonstrating that several prescription drugs, e.g., metformin, pyrimethamine and amiloride, are inhibitors of SLC19A3. Three aims are proposed: 1. Develop and characterize a humanized transgenic mouse model of SLC19A3 that can serve as an animal model to test drugs for their potential to cause thiamine deficiency. 2. Determine the effects of metformin on the pharmacokinetics and metabolic signatures of thiamine in healthy volunteers using a randomized crossover study; and 3. Use a novel miniaturized assay to screen a 2000-compound library of prescription drugs and bioactives to identify compounds that inhibit SLC19A3 and determine the key structural moieties for SLC19A3 inhibition using quantitative structure activity relationship modeling (QSAR). A multi-tiered approach will be used for the proposed studies including drug-vitamin interaction studies in healthy volunteers; metabolomic methods to identify metabolic signatures of thiamine; small molecule screening to identify inhibitors of SLC19A3; and creation and characterization of humanized mouse models of SLC19A3. Collectively, these novel studies will lead to a new knowledge of drug-vitamin interactions and their metabolic signatures. Specifically, the studies will lead to new tools that can be used in nutrient research and to a recognition that therapeutic drugs may adversely affect thiamine absorption and contribute to thiamine deficiency.","Poor nutrition and many diseases are associated with low levels of vitamin B1 (thiamine), which in turn causes health problems such as delirium and tremors.

Animal studies and observational studies in humans, including studies by investigators leading this proposed study, suggest that vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids may be protective against kidney disease. Despite the evidence base available, there is still no definitive study testing the effects of these relatively safe nutritional supplements on kidney disease progression in humans. We now have an opportunity to provide such data in a highly feasible and cost-efficient manner.

We will test the hypothesis that metals disrupt multiple classes of zinc binding proteins known to regulate immune responses, and that supplemental zinc will mitigate immunotoxicity resulting from metal exposures. In Aim 1 aim we will investigate whether serum zinc sufficiency modifies immune dysregulation in individuals exposed to environmental metals by performing a cross-sectional analysis of archived population samples for associations between markers of immune function with metal and zinc levels present in blood and urine samples. Aim 2 will test the immunotoxic effects and underlying mechanisms of U, As and environmentally relevant metal mixtures defined by the Environmental Projects, and whether the immunotoxic effects are reduced by supplemental zinc in cell and mouse models. Aim 3 will test whether dietary zinc supplementation will decrease biomarkers of immune dysregulation in exposed populations in partnership with exposed communities. The work is innovative by combining exposure information and biomonitoring data from exposed populations with mechanistic studies in experimental models. To date, there are no significant, community-based health studies describing both exposure and immunologic outcome measures in these impacted Tribal communities. We propose a novel hypothesis that metals exposures disrupt multiple classes of Zn binding proteins critical for immune function leading to immune dysregulation and that supplemental Zn will mitigate metal toxicity. This study represents the first human intervention based on zinc supplementation to ameliorate the adverse effects of mixed metal exposures. To achieve the research goals, BP1 is well integrated with the Environmental Projects to inform distinct metals exposures, BP2 to share mechanistic data and model systems, the Community Engagement and Research Translation Cores for community input and reporting results back to the communities, and the Biostatistics and Data Management Core for research support. The outcomes from these studies will be significant by testing metals and metals mixtures of concern to communities to elucidate impact on and mechanisms of immune dysregulation as detected in exposed populations, and test the feasibility of a mechanism-based intervention to alleviate the adverse effects of metals exposures.","Project 3 – BioProject 1 (BP1) - Project Narrative This project addresses health effects associated with exposure to uranium and other metals found in legacy uranium mining waste sites in three Native American communities. The studies will also test the potential of dietary zinc to decrease susceptibility of exposed populations to metals-associated dysregulation of immune function.",

In the first cycle of this award, we leveraged an innovative nationwide NIH-funded double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial, VITAL, to test the effects of vitamin D (vitamin D3 [cholecalciferol]) and marine omega-3 fatty acid (eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] + docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) supplements upon the risk of incident autoimmune disease and changes in biomarkers of systemic inflammation. Data from laboratory studies, observational epidemiologic research, and small prevention trials strongly suggest that these nutritional agents have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating benefits. Popular enthusiasm for vitamin D and fish oil supplements underscores the urgent need for rigorous testing. We have recruited, randomized, and are following 25,874 VITAL participants, men aged ≥50 and women aged ≥55 nationwide, including 20% African Americans. Following a 3 month run-in, eligible participants were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: vitamin D3 (2000 IU/d) and fish oil (EPA+DHA, 1 g/d); vitamin D3 and fish oil placebo; placebo vitamin D3 and fish oil; and placebo vitamin D3 and placebo fish oil. At yearly intervals, all participants receive a new pill supply, are asked about compliance and side effects, and report incident autoimmune diseases. A physician endpoints committee has confirmed 444 incident autoimmune disease cases by medical record review to date. In a randomly selected subcohort of 1634 VITAL participants, blood samples have been assayed for changes in C-reactive peptide, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor- receptor 2 in all four trial arms. With this renewal grant, we will complete the 5 pre-specified years and a 2 year observational extension, critically important given the long latency of autoimmune disease onset. Continued follow-up will improve statistical power for detecting preventive effects on autoimmune disease incidence, and will enable investigations of effects over time and effect modification by baseline factors and biomarkers. We hypothesize that there will be a delayed reduction in autoimmune disease, and that the largest preventive effects will be among those with high systemic inflammation, including the obese and those with elevated baseline biomarkers of inflammation. In this renewal, we also will test for changes in “Specialized Pro- Resolving Mediators” (SPM), novel omega-3 fatty acid-dependent lipids responsible for inflammation resolution. We will employ cutting-edge quantitative liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy to extend understanding of the biological mechanisms by which omega-3 fatty acids influence inflammation resolution and potentially autoimmune disease pathogenesis. Given the ongoing NIH-funded VITAL trial infrastructure, our strong multidisciplinary research team, and success with prior large mail-based trials and cohort studies, with continued funding these investigations will furnish robust and definitive results with important public health ramifications.","NARRATIVE  Autoimmune diseases affect ~ 5% of the U.S. population and carry a high burden of morbidity, health care costs, disability, and premature mortality. The purported health benefits of vitamin D and marine omega-3 fatty acids for preventing autoimmune diseases and decreasing systemic inflammation receive enormous attention in the medical literature and popular press, but definitive data supporting the beneficial effects of these two readily available over-the- counter agents are lacking. This nationwide double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial will conclusively test the potential benefits of vitamin D and marine omega-3 fatty acid supplements for the prevention of autoimmune diseases, investigating the time course of their effects and subgroups most affected, as well as the potential generation of novel lipid mediators that can promote inflammation resolution.",

HTE is an assessment of the degree to which the impact of an intervention varies between subgroups. Evidence from trials of selenium supplementation indicates that this is a critical area for investigation of HTE. To date, three major clinical trials of the trace element selenium (Se) as a chemopreventive agent have been completed. First, in the Nutritional Prevention of Cancer (NPC) trial, participants were supplemented with 200 µg of Se per day or matching placebo, and a statistically significant 58% reduction in colorectal cancer incidence among participants randomized to receive the selenium supplement was observed. Next, the results of the Selenium and Vitamin E Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) were published. The largest trial to date of Se for cancer prevention, SELECT demonstrated no reduction in risk of colorectal cancer among men supplemented with 200 µg/d of Se as L-selenomethionine. We have recently completed the Selenium Trial, which was the third major clinical trial of Se for chemoprevention. This was a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in which 1535 participants received 200 µg/d of Se as selenized yeast or placebo to ascertain whether Se supplementation reduced the risk of colorectal adenoma recurrence. No differences in overall colorectal adenoma recurrence by intervention group were detected; however, subgroup analyses revealed the presence of heterogeneity of treatment effect (HTE). Among participants who had an advanced adenoma at baseline, there was a statistically significant reduction in adenoma recurrence for those randomized to Se as compared to placebo. However, there was also a statistically significant increase in the incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) among older participants (>63 years) receiving selenium. These results identify a major research gap regarding the need for identification of individual characteristics that may contribute to HTE and thus determine whether Se supplementation elicits a beneficial or harmful effect. This is a particularly timely question given that approximately half of American adults report using dietary supplements. We propose herein to investigate several factors that may affect individual outcomes related to Se supplementation, including 1) Genetic background; 2) Intake and blood concentrations of fat-soluble antioxidants; and 3) Oxylipin profiles in response to Se supplementation. In summary, we contend that the in vivo efficacy and toxicity of Se in a given individual may be influenced by genetic background, interactions with antioxidants, and oxylipin metabolomic profiles. The findings of this study will have a direct impact on public health recommendations by identifying individual characteristics that may elicit either beneficial or harmful health effects of Se supplementation.","PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed work has the potential to make major contributions to public health recommendations regarding the potential benefits and harms of selenium supplements. We have designed three separate but complementary aims that will elucidate factors that elicit individual differential responses to selenium supplementation using genetic analysis, consideration of fat-soluble antioxidant interactions, and targeted oxylipin profiling.",

Despite advances in medical treatment of HF, mortality after HF onset and rate of recurrent HF decompensation remain high, underscoring an urgent need to identify effective prevention strategies. Observational studies showed a higher risk of death in HF patients with lower levels of vitamin D and two recent post-hoc analyses of trials conducted in mostly post- menopausal women reported a reduction in HF rates in the vitamin D group compared with placebo. Vitamin D has also been reported to improve hemodynamics and left ventricular remodeling in 229 HF patients. However, no randomized trial has examined the effects of vitamin D on primary prevention of HF or on the rate of recurrent HF decompensation in men and women. Efficacy of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on cardiovascular events has been reported in trials with low prevalence of stain use only. EPA/DHA can reduce risk factors for HF including myocardial infarction, hypertension, and diabetes. While some but not all observational studies have suggested an inverse association between EPA/DHA and the incidence of HF, no large primary prevention trial of EPA/DHA on HF has been conducted. In addition, effect modification of the effects of EPA/DHA on HF by statin has not been elucidated. This project will investigate the effects of vitamin D and EPA/DHA supplements on the incidence rate of HF and on recurrent HF decompensation in an ancillary study of the VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL), an NIH-funded randomized controlled trial of 25,874 men and women testing the efficacy of 2,000 IU/day cholecalciferol and 1 g/day EPA/DHA on cardiovascular disease and cancer endpoints.","Narrative Every year, about 900,000 Americans develop heart failure and fewer than fifty percent of those will be alive five years after the diagnosis. While post-hoc analyses and observational studies suggest that vitamin D and fish oil may reduce the rate of heart failure, no randomized trial has examined the effects of vitamin D and fish oil on the primary prevention of heart failure in a large multi-ethnic population. The current project will determine whether an intervention with vitamin D and/or fish oil reduces the risk of developing heart failure and the rate of repeated hospitalization due to heart failure among 25,874 US adults.",

ALD is an inherited paroxysmal disease characterized by fatty acid accumulation and subsequent oxidative stress. Forty percent of ALD boys develop inflammatory cerebral demyelination (cerALD) in their first decade of life. Unfortunately, we have no means of identifying boys at risk for cerALD nor do we have any means of preventing the onset of cerebral ALD. These limitations represent enormous gaps in our standard of care for these patients.  To address these limitations, the candidate and his collaborators consider the relationship of several key areas of current knowledge in cerALD: (1) ALD results from a peroxisomal gene defect that causes an accumulation of fatty acids which expose cells to lipid peroxides and other mediators of oxidative stress, (2) monocyte-lineage cells dominate the leading edge of the demyelinating lesions and (3) the lesions shares histologic features with multiple sclerosis lesions, a disease that has been linked to vitamin D insufficiency.  Armed with this knowledge, the candidate has generated preliminary data showing that (1) low serum 25-OH vitamin D levels predict the onset of cerALD; (2) monocytes and brain myelin in ALD males have low glutathione levels compared to controls; (3) the spinal fluid from cerebral ALD boys shows a cytokine expression profile consistent with oxidative stress in monocyte-lineage cells; and lastly, (4) that oral vitamin D3 supplementation in a murine model of autoimmune demyelination significantly reduces clinical disease and increases intracellular glutathione levels in monocytes.  The candidate proposes a pilot trial to study the effect of oral vitamin D3 supplementation on blood and brain biomarkers of oxidative stress in 20 ALD boys who have not yet developed cerebral ALD. In Aim 1 the candidate will use MRI techniques to monitor brain biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation in response to rising vitamin D levels. In Aim 2, the candidate will use 12-color flow cytometry and tandem mass spectrometry to study the effect of oral vitamin D3 supplementation on markers of oxidative stress in the specific immune cell subsets of study participants. In Aim 3, the candidate will use bio banked ALD monocytes to define the metabolic and immunologic pathways linking vitamin D exposure with glutathione and cytokine modulation. The candidate's long term goal is to develop treatments and biomarkers for the prevention of cerebral ALD. The addition of ALD to universal newborn screening panels in an increasing number of US states bolsters the project's immediate relevance.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) affects an estimated 1:17,000 individuals with men more severely affected than women. Nearly 40% of ALD boys develop severe inflammatory cerebral demyelination (cerebral ALD) during the first decade of life, a complication that is often fatal. There is no available treatment for preventing the onset f cerebral ALD. The proposed work expands on the candidate's observation that low pre- morbid serum vitamin D levels with later onset of cerebral ALD. It specifically examines the effect of ora vitamin D3 supplements on markers of oxidative stress in ALD boys. This has implications for the use of vitamin D3 supplements as a preventive therapy for cerebral ALD, which in turn has implications for newborn screening for ALD.",

I will use this Mentored Career Development award (K01) to fulfill a series of training objectives which build upon my prior skills, but also expand my expertise in ways which are essential to accomplishing my long-term goal. These include: learning to measure and analyze longitudinal stroke outcomes data; developing skills to assess, characterize, and measure white matter hyperintensity volume (WMHV) and cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans; learning about the design, conduct, and analysis of randomized clinical trials; and acquiring skills in mediation analysis techniques. To achieve my training objectives, I have assembled a comprehensive and complementary mentorship team which has worked together and with me for many years. My training objectives will also allow me to develop the skills needed to establish new datasets within ongoing studies during this award period. These subcohorts are necessary to achieve the research goals of the K01 and will provide preliminary data for future grant applications for independent research funding.  I will apply my training to several important research questions during this K01 award. Recently, there has been growing interest in the role that vitamin D as well as omega-3 fatty acids play in the development of cardiovascular disease events. Given the high morbidity burden of stroke, determining the effect of these supplements on stroke outcomes is very important. The NIH sponsored VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) is an ongoing randomized, double blind trial testing vitamin D3 and omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in the primary prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease. I will leverage this ongoing trial and collect additional data on stroke outcomes that would not otherwise be collected by the parent study. In addition, there is growing interest in discovering risk factors fr overall subclinical cerebrovascular disease burden in the brain as measured by WMHV and CMBs. Because WMHV and CMBs are associated with stroke outcomes, understanding risk factors associated with WMHV and CMBs in ischemic stroke patients may identify strategies to reduce the morbidity burden of stroke. I will collect MRI scans performed as part of routine medical care in participants with an ischemic stroke to create a database of WMHV and CMBs in VITAL and the Women's Healthy Study (WHS), a completed trial of the effects of low dose aspirin and vitamin E in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer with ongoing observational follow-up. By using data from both VITAL and WHS, I will have the unique opportunity to study how a wide variety of cardiovascular disease risk factors impact WMHV and CMBs in stroke patients. The training, mentorship, research experience, and opportunity to establish new subcohorts provided by this K01 award will allow me to achieve my long-term career goal of becoming an independent research in cardiovascular disease epidemiology.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal will examine the impact of vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids supplements on stroke outcomes in initially healthy populations. Additionally, I will examine whether a wide variety of cardiovascular disease risk factors, including vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid supplements, are associated with overall cerebrovascular disease burden in the brains of participants with ischemic stroke.",

No pharmacologic therapies reliably prevent or treat AKI. Novel therapeutic targets for clinical intervention are therefore needed.  Vitamin D metabolites have important and potentially beneficial antiinflammatory effects which prevent AKI in animal models. Since vitamin D metabolites are often decreased in critical illness, we propose that deficiencies in the vitamin D axis may be risk factors for incident AKI, and that exogenous vitamin D metabolites may be novel therapeutic agents for AKI prevention. Our preliminary data support these hypotheses. We showed that patients with established AKI have decreased levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25D) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D) in association with elevated fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) levels; the latter is known to suppress both renal and extra-renal conversion of 25D to 1,25D. In further preliminary data, we recently published the results of a pilot RCT demonstrating that administration of a single 2 µg IV dose of 1,25D to critically il patients increases leukocyte mRNA expression of interleukin-10 (IL-10) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). These important antiinflammatory proteins prevent AKI in animal models.  In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will leverage an established ICU cohort to perform the first comprehensive, prospective study to investigate whether 25D, 1,25D, and FGF23 are independent risk factors for adverse renal outcomes among 200 critically ill patients with a high AKI event rate. Primary outcomes will include: incident AKI, assessed by serum creatinine; renal tubular injury, assessed by urinary NGAL and KIM- 1; and need for renal replacement therapy or death. In Aim 2 we will enroll 150 critically ill patients at risk of AKI into a three-arm, double-blind, randomied study of 25D, 1,25D, or placebo to test the effects of repeated doses of vitamin D metabolites on renal and immunomodulatory endpoints. We will test whether 25D and/or 1,25D attenuate incident kidney injury, assessed by time averaged levels of both serum creatinine and urinary NGAL and KIM-1. Further, we will test whether 25D and/or 1,25D increase monocyte mRNA expression of antiinflammatory targets IL-10, HO-1, HIF1a, and thrombomodulin, decrease monocyte mRNA expression of proinflammatory targets ICAM-1 and IL-6, and increase T regulatory (Treg) %, all of which attenuate kidney injury in animal models. Additionally, we will evaluate physiologic endpoints including plasma levels of FGF23 and monocyte mRNA expression of 1-a hydroxylase and 24-hydroxylase to elucidate whether peripheral conversion of 25D to 1,25D is impaired in critical illness.  By unifying a comprehensive, prospective clinical outcomes study and an innovative trial under one thematic umbrella, we will generate novel, clinically relevant insights into the emerging role of vitamin D metabolites in critical illness an AKI that could have important diagnostic and therapeutic implications.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Acute kidney injury is a devastating complication of critical illness. Vitamin D metabolites have important and potentially beneficial antiinflammatory effects, and vitamin D levels are often decreased in critical illness. Thus, we propose that deficiencies in the vitamin D axis may be risk factors for the development of acute kidney injury, and that administration of vitamin D metabolites may be novel therapeutic agents to prevent acute kidney injury among critically ill patients.",

Supplementation of vitamin D and/or omega-3 has received attention as a potential anti-aging and cardio-protective strategy. Data from in vitro and animal models suggest that these nutrients are involved in the etiology of aging or behave like a biochemical 'Fountain of Youth' to mediate healthful aging. However, enthusiasm has outpaced the scientific evidence in humans, which is currently based on observational studies and small randomized clinical trials (RCTs) often with small doses. Large clinical trials with a high dose, daily dosing regimen, adequate sample size and trial duration, and longitudinal assessment are urgently needed.  The principal function of telomeres is to protect the genome against chromosomal aberrations. Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is consistently shown to have a direct relationship with longevity, CVD and diabetes in epidemiologic studies, and is thus considered to be a biomarker of aging. What is more, LTL is relatively short in persons with chronic inflammation, which is considered to be part of CVD and diabetic risk. The on-going NIH funded VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) is a large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2 x 2 factorial trial of vitamin D3 (2,000 IU/day) and marine omega-3 fatty acid (ɯ-3 FA, 1 g/day) supplements among a representative sample of US men aged ≥50 years and women aged ≥55 years, with an oversampling of blacks. A unique feature of VITAL is the establishment of a sub-cohort of 1,054 participants who are evaluated in person at the Harvard Clinical and Translational Science Centre (CTSC) in Boston, which allows for in-clinic plasma/buffy coat sample collection and in-depth CVD phenotyping at baseline and Year 2. We propose to examine the effects of dietary vitamin D and/or             omega-3 supplementation on LTL attrition assessed longitudinally utilizing in-clinic buffy coat samples collected at baseline, Year 2, and Year 4. Thus, we will also investigate the effects of vitamin D and/or omega-3 supplementation on the longitudinal interrelationship of LTL trajectory, plasma inflammatory     cytokines, and CVD risk factors in the VITAL trial.  This proposal is in response to the information gaps/research needs identified by the most recent Institute of Medicine (IOM) Report on Dietary Reference Intakes. The IOM report identified the need for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of vitamin D for prevention of CVD, and cellular biology of vitamin D (e.g. cellular aging) as areas of high priority. The American Heart Association and the IOM recommend that all adults eat fish regularly to reduce risk for CVD. This novel and cost-effective study is expected to provide the information necessary to answer the open question of whether dietary vitamin D and/or omega-3 supplementation are beneficial for LTL shortening. Studies of telomeres will also open new avenues for the basic understanding of vitamin D and/or omega-3 as well as their preventive and therapeutic effects of CVD.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Dietary supplementation of vitamin D and/or omega-3 has received attention as a potential anti-aging and cardio-protective strategy; however, enthusiasm has outpaced the scientific evidence in humans, and evidence at the population level remains inconclusive to inform nutritional recommendations. The urgent need has prompted us to propose this present study leveraging the infrastructure of the ongoing national trial called VITAL to examine the balance of their benefits and risks. Data obtained would serve to shape evidence-based dietary vitamin D/omega intake recommendations and guidelines in elderly people.",

Several lines of evidence suggest that vitamin D supplements might substantially reduce the risk of falls, potentially by > 25% in persons with low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels. However, trial evidence is insufficient to guide policy. The proposed study is a seamless, two stage, Bayesian response-adaptive randomized trial for dose-ranging and efficacy confirmation. The trial is designed to identify the best overall dose of vitamin D supplementation and confirm the level of efficacy of that dose for fall prevention. Participants wil be community-dwelling adults, aged 70+ (~40% black, ~60% women), with a baseline serum 25(OH)D level of 10-29 ng/ml, who report at least one fall in the prior year.  After an initial pilt phase to evaluate recruitment strategies and finalize data collection procedures, participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 4 vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) test doses: 200IU, 1000IU, 2000IU and 4000IU/d. Participants will take their assigned pills for 2 years with extended follow-up off therapy for 1 more year. Stage 1 of this design will select the best dose of vitamin D for prevention of falls over a 6m follow-up period. Participants in the control (200IU) and best dose group will continue seamlessly into Stage 2 with additional recruitment and continued follow-up of all participants. The principal outcome (Stage 2) is time to first fall (or death) over 2 years f therapy. Secondary outcomes are fall rates, patterns of falling, gait speed, balance, muscle strength, frailty, SPPB score, and, in a sample of participants, 400m walk time and accelerometry. Falls will be ascertained from fall calendars completed daily by participants. Follow-up visits will occur at 3, 12, 24 and 36m. Subgroups with potential for differential benefit from vitamin D supplementation are pre- specified as: a) race (blacks vs others), b) baseline vitamin D levels (10-19 vs 20-29ng/ml), and c) frailty status (frail, pre-frail, not frail). Our prven capacity to recruit a diverse population, including large numbers of blacks, allows us to test the effects of vitamin D supplementation in key subgroups.  Strengths of the study include a team of interdisciplinary investigators who have vast experience and an exceptional track record in the design, conduct, analysis and dissemination of clinical trials, many of which have guided policy. The investigative team includes individuals with expertise in vitamin D metabolism, endocrinology, geriatrics, assessment of physical function and falls, biostatistics, epidemiology, central laboratory procedures, adaptive designs, community engagement, and recruitment. Building on our record in previous community-based trials, we expect that trial results will be timely, rigorous, and directly relevant to public health guidelines and will immediately influence fall prevention policies related to vitamin D supplementation in older persons.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vitamin D supplements might substantially reduce the risk of falls, potentially by more than 25%.

In this K01 application, Dr. Martens aims to study the efficacy of a novel NAD+ boosting and calorie restriction-mimetic compound, nicotinamide riboside (NR), for reducing large elastic artery stiffness and blood pressure in older adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and to relate these outcomes to improvements in cerebrovascular, cognitive and neuronal function. His immediate goal is to acquire the research training and professional skills necessary to transition to an independent investigator. His long- term goal is to establish his own research program, with a focus on identifying strategies for improving cerebrovascular and cognitive/neuronal function and reducing risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in older adults. CAREER DEVELOPMENT PLAN: Dr. Martens proposes to enhance his career development by: 1) acquiring new skills in the assessment of cerebrovascular, cognitive and neuronal function to support his proposed research plan; 2) receiving training in aMCI and AD pathophysiology, geriatrics and biostatistics; and 3) refining his professional skills through formal course work, attendance and presentations at weekly journal clubs, university seminars, and national scientific meetings, and through regular interactions with his mentoring team. ENVIRONMENT: Dr. Martens will train in an outstanding aging research environment supported by a multi- disciplinary team of mentors who will provide him with research and career development training. The primary mentor, Dr. Seals, is an internationally recognized NIA-funded scientist with a strong record of successful mentoring in vascular aging research. Co-Mentor Dr. Hughson is a leading expert in cerebrovascular function and brain aging, and Dr. Bettcher has extensive experience assessing cognitive function in patients with aMCI. Dr. Banich is director of the neuroimaging center at CU-Boulder and has extensive experience with the proposed MRI-based assessments of neuronal function and structure. Dr. McQueen is director of biostatistics at the CU-Boulder Clinical and Translational Research Center (CTRC) and regularly provides mentoring and consulting to trainees and faculty conducting clinical trials. Co-mentors Dr. Potter and Dr. Schwartz are senior NIA investigators with expertise in AD and geriatric medicine, respectively, and their mentorship will complement the research training & objectives. RESEARCH: aMCI is the earliest symptomatic stage in the development of AD, which is among the fastest growing causes of morbidity and mortality in the US. Stiffening of the large elastic arteries (i.e., the aorta and carotid arteries) occurs with aging and has been linked to the development of aMCI and AD, primarily through the transmission of damaging pressure waves to the cerebral vasculature, resulting in cerebrovascular dysfunction and neuronal damage. The proposed research seeks to test the efficacy a novel CR-mimicking dietary supplement, NR, for lowering arterial stiffness in patients with aMCI and associating these changes with improved cerebrovascular, cognitive and neuronal function.","PROJECT NARRATIVE Stiffening of the elastic arteries occurs with aging and likely contributes to memory loss and risk of Alzheimer's disease, primarily by impacting blood vessels within the brain. This study will provide insight into whether a new dietary supplement that mimics the beneficial effects of calorie restriction, reduces arterial stiffness, improves arterial function within the brain and restores brain function and memory in patients with “amnestic” mild cognitive impairment. Overall, this project has the potential to identify a novel, safe and cost-effective strategy for decreasing age-related memory loss.",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy 2 (TACT2) is to perform a pragmatic and efficient replication of TACT1 in patients with diabetes and a prior heart attack. The results of this trial will determine whether disodium ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (Na2EDTA) chelation therapy receives approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is subsequently accepted to reduce the risk of major adverse events from coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with diabetes. TACT2, if positive, will also promote research into the mechanism(s) of benefits and provide novel insights into the pathobiology of CAD. The Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy (TACT1) was developed in response to a Request for Applications from NCCAM and the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) to address the concern that chelation use was widespread but there were no reliable data on either safety or efficacy. Surprisingly to cardiologists, the chelation strategy,  combination of up to 40 infusions with intravenous disodium EDTA plus oral multivitamins and multiminerals (OMVM) compared with intravenous and oral placebo, led to a significant reduction in the time to first recurrent cardiovascular event in patients with prior myocardial infarction (MI), age 50 or older, already treated with standard evidence based medical therapies (HR 0.74; 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.57- 0.95; p=0.016. The 5-year number needed to treat (NNT) was 12. In the prespecified subgroup with diabetes (n=633), the results were dramatic: the chelation-based strategy reduced the composite primary clinical endpoint by 51% (HR 0.49, 95%CI (0.33 0.75); p<0.001, 5-year NNT 5.5) and reduced total mortality by 43% (p=0.011, 5-year NNT 12). As a result of these findings, and because of the public health impact of cardiovascular disease and of diabetes, we have been encouraged by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the FDA to confirm the results of TACT1. The three Specific Aims of TACT2 are: 1) To determine if the chelation-based strategy in patients with diabetes and prior MI improves event-free survival; 2) To determine if the chelation-based strategy in patients with diabetes and prior MI reduces mortality; 3) To perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of the TACT2 chelation strategy. TACT2 will enroll 1200 diabetic patients 50 years of age or older with a prior MI and a serum creatinine of 2.0 mg/dL or less. Patients will be randomly allocated (1:1) to receive either chelation + OMVM or double placebo and followed for clinical events until the end of the 5 year trial. The primary endpoint will be a composite of all-cause mortality, recurrent

In the first funding period (9/29/10-06/30/15), we completed baseline and early follow- up of depression outcomes among nearly 19,000 successfully randomized men and women, aged 50+ years (mean age=65y), who were eligible for incidence or recurrence of late-life depression; nearly 70% of participants have provided pre-randomization blood samples for nutrient biochemical assays. Furthermore, in the Clinical and Translational Science Center (CTSC) component, detailed phenotypic assessments were conducted among a subset of over 1,000 individuals who received in-person structured psychiatric diagnostic interviews, underwent neuropsychological testing, and provided data on dimensional measures of mood, well- being, and social and daily functioning. Finally, another landmark aspect of VITAL-DEP is its substantial racial and ethnic diversity: over 25% of participants are from minority racial and/or ethnic backgrounds, including 19% who are African American. Indeed, our first funding period aims emphasized potential differences in vitamin D response among African Americans, given high risk of low 25(OH)D in this group. However, late- breaking evidence indicates that bioavailable vitamin D is of greatest relevance to race/ethnic differences. In this 5-year renewal proposal, we expand upon what has been achieved in the first period - assembly of a unique trial cohort - and focus on the unprecedented scientific opportunities afforded by this RCT design. Our Primary Aims are: 1) to extend follow-up of mood to examine with high statistical power the long-term (up to 7 years) effects of vitamin D and marine omega-3 fatty acids on depression outcomes among all ~19,000 participants; 2) to examine with high power the impact of biochemical nutrients levels of vitamin D and omega- 3 fatty acids on depression outcomes as well as treatment interaction with baseline biochemical levels. Secondary Aims focus on two critical themes that our particular trial design is uniquely poised to address: 1) racial/ethnic differences in long-term treatment effects; 2) mechanisms, mediators and moderators of mood effects of vitamin D and fish oil in this diverse cohort. Specifically, in a sub-set of 2,000 participants, we will examine relations of bioavailable vitamin D to depression, with attention to race differences in outcomes. Further, among the entire eligible CTSC cohort, we will obtain pre- and post-randomization serum brain- derived neurotrophic factor and targeted plasma metabolite levels to examine biological paths involved in mood responses to vitamin D and fish oil treatment and to test whether biomarker change explains variation in treatment effects. Thus, this proposal not only will ensure comprehensive, definitive testing of the benefits of vitamin D and fish oil for late-life mood but also will inform specific mechanisms involved in a diverse sample.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Biologic and observational evidence supports potential mental health benefits of both vitamin D and marine omega-3 fatty acids. However, it remains unclear whether the use of these supplements can prevent depression or can significantly reduce depressive symptoms in late-life. This ongoing randomized trial, conducted among approximately 19,000 U.S. men and women, respectively aged =50 years =55 years, will: 1) clarify the effects of long-term daily vitamin D and/or omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on late-life depressive symptoms and 2) inform how these agents work to impact mood and for whom.",

Most asthma is diagnosed before the age of six years and is preceded by episodes of troublesome lung symptoms – wheezing, in the years after birth. Asthma is a complex disease with both genetic and environmental exposures contributing to its development: ORMDL3 and FADS are well-replicated asthma genes while vitamin D2-5 and n-3 polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs)6 have recently been identified as important prenatal risk factors for asthma. Despite the identification of these risk factors, a complete mechanistic understanding of how these exposures and genes operate together to impact asthma development remains unknown. Metabolomic profiling has the distinct advantage of being a marker that reflects the cumulative sum of past and current environmental and genetic exposures leading to the disease. Our preliminary metabolomics work has successfully identified associations between prenatal exposures (Vitamin D, n-3 PUFAs), asthma genes (ORMDL3 and FADS), and metabolites, thereby providing a direct mechanistic connection of how these risk variants may operate together to influence disease development. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that the sphingolipid and eicosanoid pathways are important in asthma pathogenesis and may enlighten the mechanisms through which asthma genes (e.g. ORMDL3, FADS) and prenatal early life exposures (vitamin D and n-3 PUFAs) operate to cause or prevent asthma. For this proposal, we will capitalize on two randomized clinical trials with analogous study design and follow-up strategies – Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART) and Copenhagen Studies on Asthma in Childhood (COPSAC2010). Together these studies showed that prenatal vitamin D and n-3 PUFAs in supplementation reduce the risk of persistent wheeze/asthma in the first 3 years of life by 23% (p<0.01) and 32%6 (p=0.035) respectively. In this proposal we will: 1) Assess the effect of the maternal metabolome and prenatal exposures on the child metabolome; 2) Study the relationship between metabolites in the sphingolipid pathway, the ORMDL3 risk variant, and prenatal vitamin D supplementation on asthma risk; 3) Study the relationship between pro- and anti-inflammatory eicosanoids, genetic variants in FADS, and prenatal n-3 PUFA supplementation on asthma risk. Findings from this important study will have great public health importance in elucidating mechanisms involved in the development of asthma in children and could lead to preventive strategies against asthma in childhood.","PROJECT NARRATIVE Being the most common health-related cause of lost school and work days, asthma has a large public health impact. We study potential mechanisms for asthma development in two biological pathways where we believe asthma genes and prenatal vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid supplementation operate to alter asthma risk. We will use 1,218 mother/child pairs from two randomized controlled trial birth cohorts that have data rich in prenatal exposures, clinical measures, metabolomics, and genetics.",

Kidney failure is a frequent complication of sepsis and septic shock that is associated with worse outcomes. To date, the understanding of kidney injury in sepsis and septic shock has traditionally focused on decreased blood pressure leading to kidney hypoperfusion. Recent studies have challenged this paradigm, however, illustrating that sepsis associated kidney injury often occurs even when perfusion is adequate. These findings suggest that alternative pathophysiologic mechanisms may have a role in sepsis related kidney injury. The mechanisms remain poorly understood and as yet there are no proven interventions aimed at mitigating sepsis-induced kidney injury. Thiamine (vitamin B1), a key cofactor of pyruvate dehydrogenase, is a critical component of oxidative phosphorylation (i.e. aerobic mitochondrial respiration). In the absence of thiamine, mitochondrial metabolism shifts towards anaerobic energy production, which is inefficient and results in lactate production. Thiamine deficiency has also been linked to increased levels of reactive oxygen species. Our research group has previously demonstrated that thiamine deficiency is common in critical illness and inversely associated with lactate levels. We hypothesize that thiamine deficiency during critical illness may occur due to increased metabolic demand which rapidly consumes available thiamine stores. In a randomized trial, our research group has found that the administration of thiamine to thiamine deficient patients with septic shock leads to reduced lactate at 24-hours. In a post-hoc analysis of that study, my work has shown that patients (including both thiamine replete and thiamine deficient patients) who received thiamine had lower creatinine values at 24-hours and were less likely to require kidney replacement therapy (e.g. dialysis). Our research group has also shown improved cellular oxygen consumption in septic patients and cardiac surgery patients who receive thiamine. Given the above, we hypothesize that thiamine attenuates kidney injury during septic shock by supporting aerobic mitochondrial metabolism. To test this hypothesis, we have planned a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial of thiamine to improve in kidney function in patients with septic shock. This award will allow me to further develop as a physician-investigator and to test important hypotheses with potentially significant therapeutic benefits for patients with sepsis and septic shock.","Project Narrative Septic shock is a common and highly lethal condition. Our research group has previously found evidence that thiamine, a B vitamin, may prevent kidney injury during septic shock. To test this hypothesis, we propose a randomized, controlled clinical trial of thiamine for kidney protection in patients with septic shock.",

Although vitamin D supplements are widely used to improve bone health, evidence for a role of supplemental vitamin D alone in reducing fractures is lacking. While the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] level is considered the best analyte to assess vitamin D status, currently there is no consensus on the optimal circulating total 25(OH)D concentration for bone. While, like many hormones, vitamin D circulates bound to proteins, the relative importance of free 25(OH)D (FVD) or bioavailable 25(OH)D levels on fracture risk is not known. New advances in technology make it possible to directly measure the biologically active, FVD level. Results from recent observational studies on whether FVD and/or bioavailable 25(OH)D are more strongly associated than total 25(OH)D levels with calcium homeostasis and bone mineral density (BMD) are inconsistent. In addition, there are no data from large, randomized controlled trials on whether bioavailable 25(OH)D and/or FVD vs. total 25(OH)D levels or gene variations in vitamin D-related pathways modify effects of supplemental vitamin D on fractures and changes in BMD. To fill gaps in knowledge, we propose an ancillary study to the large, NIH-sponsored, randomized, controlled VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) that is testing effects of supplemental vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol, 2000 IU/d), and/or omega-3 fatty acids (fish oil, 1 g/d) in the primary prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease in 25,874 U.S. men (aged ≥50) and women (aged ≥55), including 5,107 African Americans. The proposed ancillary study will definitively determine whether supplemental, high-dose, vitamin D3 alone reduces incident total, non-vertebral and hip fractures by extending adjudication of fractures to the full 5 years of treatment in 25,874 VITAL participants nationwide. The proposed studies will also rigorously test whether concentrations of bioavailable 25(OH)D and/or FVD are more strongly associated with changes in BMD and incident fractures than total 25(OH)D levels; and whether these vitamin D biomarkers and genetic variants in vitamin D-related pathways modify effects of supplemental vitamin D on BMD and fracture risk. For each of the proposed aims, we will assess whether results vary by (a) sex, (b) race/ethnicity, and (c) BMI. Key VITAL resources will be leveraged at no additional cost to the proposed studies including: blood samples and BMD measurements (at baseline and follow-up), extensive data on changes in 25(OH)D levels over time (in the treatment vs. placebo arms), measures of calcium homeostasis, information on clinical risk factors, and extracted DNA. This proposal provides a unique and cost- efficient opportunity to generate important positive or informative negative results about effects of supplemental vitamin D3 alone on fracture risk, while also elucidating the relative importance of vitamin D biomarkers and genetic variations in vitamin D-related pathways on bone. Findings from the proposed ancillary study have the potential for major clinical as well as public health impact for both men and women in the U.S.","NARRATIVE Vitamin D supplements are widely promoted for bone health, but definitive data on benefits and risks of high- dose, supplemental vitamin D on fracture prevention are lacking. Results from this proposed ancillary study to the large, VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) will clarify the role of total, bioavailable, and free vitamin D levels on fracture outcomes and bone density; evaluate gene variants that may modify effects of supplemental vitamin D on bone health measures; and fill important gaps in knowledge on whether high dose, supplemental vitamin D is safe and effective in the primary prevention of fractures in women and men across the U.S.",

Despite the profound public health burden, there have been no clinical trials that have attempted to directly address the neurodevelopmental deficits that are so debilitating in FASD. Extensive pre- clinical work (Thomas et al. and others) has provided evidence that choline supplementation is effective in attenuating the neurodevelopmental deficits caused by prenatal alcohol exposure in animal models. Our group has taken the initial steps toward translating this work to humans with two randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled trials. We first conducted a pilot study to ensure the feasibility, tolerability, and safety of choline supplementation in 20 children with FASD (Fuglestad et al, 2013). Next, we completed a study of 40 additional participants with the goals of establishing a target dosage for young children, testing efficacy in the domain of memory, and determining a developmental window for choline's effects (detailed in `preliminary studies').  Briefly, our pilot data revealed that: 1. Children wih FASD consume insufficient dietary choline on average; 2. Choline supplementation was safe, tolerable and feasible for 2-5 year olds; 3. Supplementation for 9 months increased children's explicit memory performance relative to placebo; 4. Significant memory improvement was seen in 2-3 year olds but not 4-5 year olds. For 2-3 year olds, memory improvement was 21 percentage points in the choline arm compared to 2 percentage points in the placebo arm; 5. A dose ranging from 10-19 mg/kg was associated with the largest improvement in memory; 6. A very common single- nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs12325817), related to endogenous choline production, appears to moderate the efficacy of choline for children with FASD.  These findings directly inform the next study. Aim 1 involves evaluating a 19 mg/kg dose in 60 children with FASD, ages 2 to 5. This dosing scheme will optimize the neurocognitive benefits and further enhance tolerability of the intervention. In addition to continuing the evaluation of memory benefits from choline, Aim 2 adds measures of attention and executive function as possible additional targets.

Published evidence links MCI to elevated oxidative stress caused by increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). To defend against the damaging potential of ROS (which causes oxidative stress, OxS), cells normally depend on antioxidants, and Glutathione (GSH) is the main component of human endogenous intracellular antioxidant defenses. GSH is a tripeptide composed of three amino-acids, cysteine, glycine and glutamic acid. Since elderly humans are known to have an increased risk of developing elevated OxS and GSH deficiency, we investigated and reported that intracellular GSH deficiency in elderly humans occurs primarily due to intracellular deficiency of two of its precursor amino-acids cysteine and glycine, but not glutamic acid, and that these GSH-deficient elderly humans had elevated ROS levels indicating elevated OxS. Supplementing cysteine (as n-acetylcysteine) plus glycine orally as capsules for 2-weeks replenished their own intracellular concentrations, improved intracellular GSH synthesis, restored intracellular GSH levels and lowered ROS/OxS to levels seen in younger humans. GSH is also a key component of mitochondrial antioxidant defenses, and GSH depletion induces mitochondrial dysfunction with elevated ROS levels, neuronal injury and apoptosis. We studied and reported that mitochondrial dysfunction and OxS in aging (elderly humans and aged mice) can be improved by correcting GSH deficiency. These findings have implications for MCI in elderly humans. In a small ongoing open-label pilot study investigating the long-term safety and impact of supplementing cysteine and glycine on mitochondrial function, OxS and cognitive function (NCT02348762), we found significant improvements in memory, language and executive function at 4w, 12w and 24w after starting cysteine plus glycine supplementation, and these benefits appear to recede 12w after stopping these supplements. These preliminary data support the exciting possibility that cysteine plus glycine supplementation in elderly humans could improve MCI by improving GSH concentrations, mitochondrial function, and/or improving vascular/endothelial function, and by lowering OxS. The goals of this pilot trial are to (a) establish the relationship in older humans between MCI, GSH deficiency, impaired mitochondrial fuel oxidation and elevated OxS, and (b) determine proof-of- concept of whether supplementing cysteine plus glycine to correct these defects improves MCI in aging.","Elderly humans have an increased risk of dementia which begins as mild defects in memory called mild cognitive impairment – we do not know why this happens and there is no effective treatment. Our group found that supplementing the diets of such elderly humans with protein building blocks called cysteine and glycine improves their cognitive function, and when these supplements are stopped the benefits begin to decline. This exploratory study will find out if this effect is real and identify factors responsible for cognitive impairment (and improvement) by studying a bigger group of elderly humans with mild cognitive impairment who will be evaluated 12 weeks after receiving either cysteine plus glycine or a placebo protein, and a further 12-weeks after stopping these supplement proteins.",

Most cases are sporadic, but Mendelian pedigrees have been described, typically with low penetrance. Few genes have been identified, encoding transcription and growth factors (e.g. SOX2, BMP4) active during early eye development. Most cases are unexplained. Maternal nutrition may contribute to the etiology. We found mutations in three retinoid (vitamin A) pathway genes (RBP4, STRA6, ALDH1A3) account for >5% of MAC cases, including a new gain-of-function mechanism for this disease. The RBP4 alleles encode dominant-negative serum retinol binding proteins, which bind retinol cargo poorly but adhere to the STRA6 cell surface receptor too tightly (40-fold higher affinity) – so may disrupt retinol transfer across the yolk sac and placenta, to the embryo. The dnRBP4 mutations define a new mode of maternal inheritance and illuminate a critical protein- receptor interaction. In addition, clustered hypomorphic STRA6 alleles suggest a new domain function for this polytopic receptor. We will investigate the mechanism for increased RBP affinity and critical features of the RBP-STRA6 interaction, and test the receptor competition model for MAC pathogenesis [1] in vitro and [2] in vivo, using a comprehensive biochemical, cell-based, radioisotopic and histological approach, mouse models with specific knock-out or genome-edited (CRISPR/Cas9) alleles, and dietary manipulation. In addition, [3] we will systematically screen a cohort of MAC patients using whole exome sequencing (WES) and segmental dosage (SNP) analysis to find causative mutations in new genes.","NARRATIVE We will investigate gene defects in children whose eyes are absent (anophthalmia), very small or malformed (coloboma), using biochemical methods, mouse models and genome sequencing. Our study is centered on new mutations that appear to block retinol (vitamin A) transport and metabolism, or the separation of neural and pigmented layers in the developing retina. We will test new models for hereditary disease, establish a nutritional basis for maternal inheritance of disease traits in pedigrees, and explore the earliest steps in eye formation. The results should improve diagnosis and understanding of eye malformations, and complex genetic factors underlying birth defects.",

This project features novel technology – the latest-generation Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip 850K platform – and is embedded within the randomized study design of VITAL (VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL; NCT01169259) and VITAL-DEP (NCT01696435), a late-life depression prevention ancillary study. The proposal is directly relevant to two NIA high-priority topics: 1) “geroscience approaches to AD” and 2) understanding “molecular mechanisms of NPS in ADRD” using “high-dimensional molecular and phenotypic data from aging cohorts”. The conceptual framework of this proposal is that: accelerated biological aging predisposes to worse brain aging; depression, anxiety and other psychopathology are involved in faster aging of both body and brain; furthermore, cognitive impairment accompanied by NPS vs. without NPS may represent underlying mechanisms that generate higher risk for worse AD/ADRD outcomes. Genome-wide methylation analysis is a powerful approach to address this model. First, pilot data in VITAL- DEP, and results from other groups, indicate that DNAm age correlates more strongly with aging than other markers. Second, DNAm age is a sensitive indicator of change in molecular aging over the relevant follow-up period for observing cognitive decline. Third, DNA methylation is a biomarker not only of aging but also of gene expression. Indeed, a DNAm analytic approach to investigate differences in epigenetic aging and gene expression may uncover targetable molecular mechanisms that undergird varying cognitive and NPS phenotypes and cognitive outcomes. We propose three Specific Aims to test hypotheses in our model. First, we will determine differences in epigenetic aging by contrasting cognitive and NPS phenotypes: we will assess baseline differences in epigenetic aging among VITAL-DEP participants (aged 50-90 years) with normal cognition, MCI without NPS and MCI with NPS, and test whether NPS severity correlates with epigenetic aging. Second, we will evaluate genome-wide differences in methylation (i.e., at specific CpG sites) in MCI with vs. without NPS. Third, in a longitudinal analysis using repeated measures of both DNA methylation and cognitive tests, we will determine whether epigenetic aging correlates with cognitive decline; we will also explore interactions with NPS and the vitamin D and omega-3 randomized agents. Strong DNAm pilot data in VITAL-DEP and the ability to leverage this large, well-characterized cohort and its biospecimen resources and infrastructure provide reassurance that this project can achieve its novel, high-impact aims.","PROJECT NARRATIVE This novel proposal will measure differences in epigenetic biomarkers of DNA methylation age (a marker of molecular aging) and genome-wide differences in DNA methylation (a mechanism that influences gene expression) among older adults with contrasting cognitive and neuropsychiatric phenotypes.

Most asthma is diagnosed before the age of six. Thus, prenatal and early life exposures play an important role in the development of asthma and allergies. On the basis of finding an inverse association between family size and atopy, it was postulated that reduced microbial exposure in early life explains the epidemic of allergic diseases (the “hygiene hypothesis”). The original hygiene hypothesis has undergone changes and refinement, and is now taken to mean not just simply a reduced microbial exposure, but perhaps changes in the breadth and types of microorganisms coupled with changing environments. The gut flora is, quantitatively, the most important postnatal source of microbial stimulation of the immune system. Significant differences between the gut flora of children in industrialized and developing nations suggest that the high prevalence of asthma in affluent nations may be due to changes in the intestinal flora of young infants. This concept of “dysbiotic drift,” whereby environmental forces related to Westernized lifestyles leads to a shift of the developing microbiota away from the norm, may explain why many chronic inflammatory conditions, such as asthma, are associated with Westernized lifestyles. Dysbiosis is a potential mechanism by which the environment interacts with the early developing immune system to program risk for chronic disease. While there are a growing number of studies that are investigating the role of the intestinal microbiome in asthma, these have examined stool samples obtained at one point in time. Since the intestinal microbiome undergoes rapid changes before it becomes established between the ages of 1 and 3 years of life, longitudinal studies are needed. Additionally, no studies have accounted for the host genetic background, which may determine both the development of dysbiosis and who develops asthma when faced with dysbiosis. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that vitamin D deficiency in the pre-, peri-, and immediate post-natal periods, in addition to host genetic influences, lead to intestinal dysbiosis in early life. Dysbiosis, in the proper host genetic context, then increases the risk for development of asthma. While we have collected information on a host of other relevant exposures, this proposal will focus on vitamin D as the primary exposure of interest. We have put together 2 vitamin D clinical trial populations – Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART) and Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood (COPSAC2010) – with prospective collection of exposures during pregnancy and early life, that we will leverage to test our hypotheses. This proposal is in response to FOA RFA-OD-16-004, Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) Pediatric Cohorts (UG3/UH3). In these cohorts, we will first determine the patterns of change in the early intestinal microbiome (both composition and metabolic function) up to age 6 years that are related with vitamin D deficiency in the prenatal and perinatal periods. We will also investigate genetic markers of the host that affect these patterns in the intestinal microbiome. We will then investigate the relationship of these patterns of change in the microbiome with the presence of asthma by age 6 years. Findings from this project will point to potential mechanisms by which early environmental exposures interact with the developing intestinal microbiome and the host to confer risk for asthma.","PROJECT NARRATIVE Asthma and allergies are the most common chronic disorders in children. There is a lack of understanding of the risk factors and mechanisms that lead to asthma and allergies. We will investigate the role of two novel risk factors – vitamin D and the intestinal microbiome – on the risk of asthma and allergies in the child, and findings from this important and efficient study could form the basis for development of new and important approaches to reduction of these conditions.",

Maternal smoking during pregnancy adversely affects lung development as seen by lifelong decreases in pulmonary function and increased risk of asthma. In a randomized controlled trial (RCT), published in JAMA, we have provided evidence that maternal vitamin C supplementation (500 mg daily during pregnancy) can decrease the effects of maternal smoking during pregnancy on offspring lung function and the subsequent incidence of wheeze. The purpose of this ECHO application is to combine the offspring from the prenatal cohorts of two RCTs studying the effects of vitamin C supplementation to pregnant smokers on offspring respiratory outcomes and to determine if the innovative therapy of maternal vitamin C supplementation during pregnancy leads to prolonged improvements on offspring’s pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and respiratory health. To begin to understand mechanisms by which prenatal vitamin C may be preventing changes in the health of offspring of smokers, we examined gene specific DNA methylation from a subset of placentas, cord bloods and buccal swabs (ages 2-5) collected from subjects who were the offspring of prospectively-followed pregnant placebo- treated smokers, vitamin C-treated smokers, or non-smokers. In parallel with the effects of vitamin C on the reduction of the effects of maternal smoking on offspring PFTs and wheeze, the supplementary vitamin C prevented the majority of significant changes in DNA methylation induced by maternal smoking in both placentas and cord blood. Strikingly, this prevention of alterations in DNA methylation was still evident 2-5 years later in offspring buccal swabs. This preliminary data suggests that the mechanism underlying vitamin C’s prevention of some of the effects of maternal smoking on offspring pulmonary health involves the prevention of epigenetic changes induced by maternal smoking. Thus this application has 4 specific aims: 1, to create the combined cohort of offspring from the 2 RCTs of vitamin C supplementation to pregnant smokers; 2, to determine if the protective effects of maternal vitamin C supplementation to pregnant smokers on offspring pulmonary health extend to early adolescence; 3, to begin to characterize the epigenetic mechanisms that appear to underlie the effects of smoking during pregnancy on offspring lung health and on the protective effects of vitamin C; and 4, to gather core data for and interact with the overall ECHO study. Respiratory health will be assessed by longitudinal semi-annual, validated respiratory histories and yearly PFTs beginning at 3 years of age. Buccal swabs will be collected yearly and blood at 6, 9 and 12 years to provide DNA for genetic analysis. DNA methylation changes will be measured by methylation chips and bisulfite sequencing. This study will address how smoking during pregnancy affects respiratory outcomes, provide mechanistic and therapeutic insights, and provide subjects and data to ECHO to address other key outcomes.","Narrative Maternal smoking during pregnancy is the largest preventable cause of childhood respiratory illness, and children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy show lifetime decreases in pulmonary function and increased respiratory illnesses and asthma. Sadly, more than 50% of smokers who become pregnant continue to smoke and approximately 20% of expenditures for childhood respiratory illness are caused by maternal smoking amounting to over $1 billion annually in current health care dollars. The purpose of this ECHO application is to combine two prenatal cohorts to study the effects of maternal smoking during pregnancy on respiratory outcomes, determine if the innovative therapy of maternal vitamin C supplementation during pregnancy leads to prolonged improvements on offspring’s pulmonary function tests and respiratory health, and to interact with the greater ECHO cohort to promote childhood health and well-being.",

The mortality in this group of patients is unacceptably high. A majority of the deaths are due to cardiovascular diseases, followed by infectious complications and protein-energy wasting. Strategies to reduce the mortality of MHD patients, including those directed at traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as statins, have largely been ineffective. Inflammation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and protein-energy wasting. Biomarkers of the inflammatory state such as       C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are elevated in MHD patients and are also robust predictors of cardiovascular events and mortality in this patient population. While anti-inflammatory interventions, especially specific anti-cytokin therapies have been used successfully to treat patients with inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, and while encouraging studies have been reported in improving glycemic control and beta cell function in type 2 diabetes, there are only limited studies using these interventions in MHD patients. Our investigative group has performed a series of studies investigating the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of a number of anti-inflammatory therapies in MHD patients, including Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), Fish Oil (EPA+DHA), Vitamin E (gamma-tocopherol), alpha lipoic acid (ALA) and CoEnyzme Q10 in studies ranging from 14 patients to 300 patients. We have shown that amongst these interventions, IL-1ra and Fish Oil therapies have the most significant beneficial effects on inflammatory markers, such as hsCRP and    IL- 6; whereas Vitamin E and ALA therapies do not influence inflammatory state in these patients.

The radical cystectomy operation is fraught with the highest complication rates of all urologic oncology surgeries performed and is also extremely catabolic. As the National Cancer Institute has identified in its provocative questions 2 & 11, variations in immune function and nutritional interventions affect the response to cancer treatment. Radical cystectomy will continue to save lives, but there is a high cost in terms of persistent surgical complications. The long-term goal of this project is to unlock the potential of nutrition interventions to improve outcomes, survival, and quality of life in cancer patients. The objective of this project is to determine the impact of a specialized form of nutritional support on surgical outcomes and to better understand the mechanisms by which it acts. The hypothesis is that perioperative use of a specialized form of nutritional support will have greater efficacy than a standard form of nutritional support to reduce post- operative complications. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of published preliminary data produced in the applicants' laboratories and expert guidelines calling for more rigorous study of this approach. The rationale is that Specialized IMmunonutrition (SIM) is fortified with nutrients (L-arginine, omega-3 fatty acids, dietary nucleotides, and vitamin A) that have immediate effects on immune and inflammatory responses, muscle sparing, and wound healing after surgery. Guided by strong preliminary data, the hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: 1) To determine the impact of perioperative SIM versus an identical Oral Nutrition Support (ONS) lacking the immuno-modulators on post-operative complications from RC; 2) To compare the impact of SIM to ONS on secondary clinical outcomes after RC surgery; 3) To evaluate the impact of consuming SIM compared to ONS for restraining myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), decreasing inflammation, and modulating nutrient metabolism. The project is significant because it offers a high yield, low-risk, low-cost strategy to improve the outcome of patients with bladder cancer who undergo RC. Our innovative approach could transform clinical practice to reduce post- operative complications, thereby diminishing the burden of bladder cancer surgery and has the added potential to help many other surgical patients beyond cystectomy.","PROJECT NARRATIVE The ultimate goal of this research is to unlock the potential of nutrition interventions to improve outcomes, survival, and quality of life in cancer patients.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Maternal folic acid, the synthetic form of folate, is one of the first modifiable factors identified to date with the potential to reduce occurrence of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) by 40% if taken near conception. Folic acid appears to protect against ASD especially in mothers and children who are genetically susceptible to inefficient folate-dependent one-carbon and methylation metabolism, but this finding needs replication. In addition to being essential for neurodevelopment, folate is a primary methyl-donor for methylation reactions, including DNA methylation. The time near conception is an especially critical period for adequate methyl supply during cycles of active demethylation and re-methylation of the genome during embryogenesis. Our preliminary data show that folic acid supplementation is associated with even greater reductions in ASD risk, by 75%, in younger siblings of children with ASD. In addition, we found DNA methylation differences associated with no maternal use of folic acid supplements in birth tissues (placenta and cord blood) for genes with nuclear regulatory and brain development functions that could have implications for ASD.  The goal of the proposed work is to leverage data and samples from mother-child pairs in two large prospective pregnancy cohorts of high-risk infant siblings to examine specific pathways for prevention of ASD through maternal dietary and supplemental folate intake. This work will build on previous studies by examining exposures collected prospectively, with more accuracy in terms of timing and dose. We will be first to examine whether other methyl-donor B-vitamins have associated effects. We will include information on dietary and supplemental folate and B-vitamin intake from validated instruments, and measurements from maternal first trimester serum, cord blood, and fetal placental tissue. We will examine folic acid interactions with genetic susceptibility factors. Finally, we will increase understanding of the underlying mechanisms by identifying DNA methylation changes associated with folate status, and investigate whether these changes overlap with methylation patterns observed in autistic brains, using innovative methods, multiple platforms, and replication across tissue type and study population, to address challenges associated with DNA methylation measurement. Through completion of the proposed project, we will gain a better understanding of how strongly folic acid is associated with reduced risk of ASD in high-risk families, when intake is most associated and at what levels, how this association differs based on genetic susceptibility, and whether maternal folic acid intake alters DNA methylation profiles in ways that could decrease ASD risk. These findings will have great clinical and public health implications, informing autism prevention trial and ultimately changes in recommendations and policy.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Through completion of the proposed project, we will gain a better understanding of how strongly folic acid and other B-vitamins are associated with reduced risk of ASD in younger siblings within high-risk families, when intake is most associated and at what levels, how the folate association differs based on genetic susceptibility, and whether maternal folic acid intake alters DNA methylation profiles in ways that could decrease ASD risk.

Annual follow-up questionnaires assess treatment compliance (confirmed by blood samples in a subset of participants), side effects, endpoint occurrence, and cancer and vascular risk factors. Self-reported endpoints are confirmed by medical record review by physicians blinded to treatment assignment, and deaths are ascertained through the National Death Index-Plus and other sources. Our archived blood samples allow assessment of effect modification by baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid levels, changes in biomarkers over time, and testing of genetic/biochemical hypotheses. With our scientific colleagues, we have obtained funding for 18 ancillary studies to evaluate the role of these supplements in preventing other chronic diseases (including diabetes, cognitive decline, depression, and autoimmune disorders), and established an in-clinic component for in-depth phenotyping of a subcohort (n=1000). The trial is expected to provide either definitive positive or informative null results for our primary hypotheses and will serve as a national resource for research on the health effects of vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids, with opportunities for extensive collaborations. This is a high-impact trial due to the potential for major clinical and public health implications of the findings.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purported health benefits of vitamin D and marine omega-3 fatty acids continue to receive much attention in the medical literature and the popular press. However, definitive data on health benefits and risks of these agents are lacking.

Recent studies suggest the exciting possibility that vitamin D supplementation, a safe and easy-to-implement therapy in children, may lengthen PCR and increase residual beta cell function (RBCF). However, existing studies employed a suboptimal vitamin D dose or lacked a standardized insulin treatment protocol, precluding solid conclusions and preventing the field from moving forward with translation to clinical practice. This trial's rationale is to securely establish the effect of an adequate dose of vitamin D on PCR and RBCF. We hypothesize that vitamin D will increase RBCF and prolong PCR. The primary aim is to determine the effect of adjunctive vitamin D on RBCF and PCR in youth with T1D maintained on a standardized insulin protocol. We propose a 12-month randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled, parallel design trial of ergocalciferol vs. placebo in 40 subjects of 10-21 years with newly-diagnosed T1D. The primary outcome is the change over time in stimulated C-peptide (a measure of RBCF). Secondary outcomes include change over time in insulin-dose- adjusted-hemoglobin-A1c (HbA1c) (IDAA1C; a measure of PCR), HbA1c, and total daily dose of insulin. Mechanistic studies will explore whether beneficial effects of vitamin D are associated with increased GLP-1 levels or decreased inflammatory markers, and whether response to vitamin D is impacted by T1D-risk polymorphisms. If our hypotheses are true, these findings may completely alter the approach to the early management of T1D, with strong emphasis on prolonging the honeymoon phase using a readily available and easily affordable vitamin D while maintaining these patients on a standardized insulin treatment regimen.","Project Narrative This project is designed to study the role of vitamin D supplementation on the honeymoon phase of type 1 diabetes in children who are on standardized insulin treatment. The results could lead to significant changes in the approach to the early phase of type 1 diabetes with a strong emphasis on prolonging the honeymoon phase by using vitamin D and maintaining these patients on a standardized insulin regimen. The overall goal is to reduce the long-term complications of type 1 diabetes.",

Dr. Bethea’s long-term goal is to carry out studies that will result in a better understanding of factors that influence cancer survivorship and that will lead, ultimately, to higher survival among Black women affected by breast cancer and reduced cancer health disparities. She has already had training in environmental health and cancer epidemiology. Through the K01 training, she will develop expertise in cancer survivorship, statistical analyses of survival data, and molecular epidemiology, under the mentorship of a distinguished panel of researchers – Drs. Julie Palmer, Christine Ambrosone, Nancy Keating, Michael LaValley, and Edward Ruiz-Narváez. The mortality rate from breast cancer, the most commonly occurring cancer among women in the U.S., is 42% higher in Black women than White women. Dr. Bethea’s research will address an understudied topic, modifiable factors related to breast cancer survivorship in Black women. To this end, her proposed research utilizes data from the Black Women’s Health Study (BWHS), a longitudinal study of 59,000 African American women. During follow-up, more than 2,300 incident invasive breast cancer cases have occurred and they will be the subject of Dr. Bethea’s research. Dr. Bethea will assess several modifiable risk factors – post-diagnosis use of aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and post- diagnosis use of vitamin D supplements and of predicted plasma vitamin D levels – in relation to breast cancer recurrence and breast cancer-specific mortality among breast cancer cases in the BWHS. She will create genetic risk scores using data on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from candidate genes and will assess whether the associations of aspirin/other NSAIDs or of vitamin D supplementation and predicted plasma vitamin D levels with breast cancer recurrence and breast cancer-specific mortality are modified by genetic risk scores. Thus, Dr. Bethea will create a specific area of research in which she is highly proficient. As an independent researcher, it is anticipated that she will lead further BWHS research on cancer survivorship, which could be stand-alone studies or collaborative studies with other investigators. Dr. Bethea is an outstanding candidate. A K01 career development award will enable her to conduct important research as an independent investigator and put her on the path to obtaining NIH R01 and similar grant support and on a path to promotion. Importantly, it will also provide valuable information on factors related to breast cancer survival in Black women.","PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposal will support didactic training and mentored research in cancer survival and molecular epidemiology for Dr. Traci Bethea. Using these skills, Dr. Bethea will assess the effects of aspirin use and vitamin D on breast cancer recurrence and breast cancer-specific mortality in Black women and the influence of selected genetic variants on the associations. This project will be the first such research in Black women, who have considerably higher rates of breast cancer mortality than do White women.",

It is currently estimated that 33.5 million people worldwide are afflicted with AF. Once established, AF is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, much of which is not impacted by current treatment options. In this competing continuation of the VITAL Rhythm Study, we propose to continue our evaluation of the balance of benefits and risks of marine omega-3 fatty acid (840 mg eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] + docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) and vitamin D3 (2,000 IU/day cholecalciferol) on AF incidence in the setting of an NIH-funded large-scale clinical trial, the VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL). VITAL is an ongoing, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2x2 factorial trial specifically designed to evaluate the efficacy of vitamin D3 and marine omega-3 fatty acid supplements in the primary prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease among 25,874 men (aged 50+ years) and women (aged 55+ years). Benefits and risks with respect to incident AF have been postulated for both of these commonly used supplements based on results from observational studies and short-term secondary prevention randomized trials, but definitive data from a large-scale primary prevention randomized trial are lacking. In this competing continuation, we propose to continue our ancillary study that is in the process of ascertaining and adjudicating AF outcomes within the VITAL trial to test whether long-term treatment (5-years) with omega-3 fatty acid and/or vitamin D3 supplementation has an impact on the incidence AF over 7-years of follow-up in an older population. Case validation of incident AF is ongoing and involves systematic ascertainment of physician diagnoses of AF on annual study questionnaires supplemented by CMS linkage followed by collection of detailed diagnostic information from medical records. The extended follow-up will allow us to fully ascertain and adjudicate the AF endpoints occurring throughout the 5 year VITAL randomized trial and a 2-year post-intervention period and determine whether these agents might have a selective impact on persistent versus paroxysmal forms of AF. Since both agents are known to impact biologic processes involved in atrial structural and electrical remodeling, long-term post-intervention benefits and/or selective benefits on persistent forms of AF are plausible. The additional endpoints that will be adjudicated during the continuation along with the separately funded measurements of plasma 25(OH)D and EPA+DHA assays in the VITAL trial will also allow us to perform important sub-analyses according to sex and baseline nutrient level. In summary, we propose to build on the infrastructure and processes created in the first funding cycle and continue to take advantage of the enormous investment of resources and infrastructure in the VITAL trial to provide a definitive and full assessment of the benefits and risks of these agents on AF incidence and persistence. If beneficial, then these agents would represent the first therapy proven effective for AF prevention.","Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained heart rhythm disturbance and accounts for approximately 15% of strokes and is associated with doubling of mortality. Once established, atrial fibrillation is difficult to treat; and therefore, research directed at prevention of atrial fibrillation is essential. Findings from this proposed study conducted within a large clinical trial will clarify whether vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid supplementation reduces the long term risk of developing AF and progression to more severe forms of AF, providing important data applicable to public health and clinical guidelines for AF prevention.",

Lower intensity and better-tolerated, cost-effective treatment strategies are needed for these patients. Low vitamin D levels at diagnosis of indolent lymphomas are strongly associated with inferior outcomes to treatment. Standard therapy for low tumor burden, indolent lymphoma includes a single agent monoclonal antibody (rituximab). In this proposal, we will complete a double-blind, placebo- controlled randomized trial evaluating if vitamin D supplementation with 2000IU oral tablets daily for three years improves the progression-free survival of patients with indolent lymphoma treated with single agent rituximab. Stratification factors for randomization will include histology and FL-IPI prognostic score. The primary endpoint of the trial is progression-free survival over three years; secondary endpoints include response at 13 weeks, and overall survival. Planned subset analyses include follicular lymphoma histology and female sex. With 210 randomized patients, we will have 80% power to detect a HR = 0.55 at a two sided alpha = 0.05 level of significance. This clinical trial will be coordinated at the University of Rochester Wilmot Cancer Institute, and six expert lymphoma centers from the Lymphoma Epidemiology of Outcomes (LEO) Consortium will participate. We will leverage this LEO consortium for tumor banking and prospective patient-reported outcomes of enrolled patients. We will also identify if baseline and/or restaging serum vitamin D levels predict subgroups of patients for whom Vitamin D supplementation is particularly effective or particularly ineffective. Finally, since there is evidence to suggest that response to oral vitamin D supplementation may be dependent upon specific genotypes of the Vitamin D receptor (VDR) and vitamin D binding protein (DPB), we will utilize whole exome sequencing to determine whether vitamin D-related germline variations are critical determinants of outcome in the context of vitamin D supplementation of patients with indolent lymphoma. Our aims the defining threshold levels of vitamin D where supplementation is most effective and the impact of germline polymorphisms on outcome will inform future trial designs and contribute to mechanistic understanding. Demonstrating a benefit to vitamin D supplementation in this randomized trial would rapidly change standard of care in the most common presentation of indolent lymphoma, and provide a low-risk, well-tolerated, inexpensive option delaying the time to morbid treatments.","PROJECT NARRATIVE Several studies suggest Vitamin D deficiency is correlated with inferior outcome after treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In this proposal, we will conduct a randomized clinical trial (ILyAD: Indolent lymphoma and vitamin D) comparing standard rituximab therapy with vitamin D supplementation to standard rituximab therapy and placebo in patients with low tumor burden indolent lymphoma. We will also explore predictors of response to vitamin D supplementation within this clinical study.",

Vaginal and gastrointestinal (GI) colonization with GBS occurs in up to 30% of adult women, with highest rates in African Americans. Pregnant women can pass GBS to their fetuses during vaginal birth, putting them at risk for Early Onset Group B Streptococcus Disease (EOGBSD), which is associated with a neonatal mortality rate of 5-10% and morbidity of approximately 50%. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2010 guidelines require universal antepartum GBS screening by vaginal to rectal cultures of all women at 35-37 weeks gestation, and intravenously administered intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) of two or more doses if a woman is found to be colonized with GBS. While use of these guidelines has significantly reduced EOGBSD incidence from 1.7 per 1,000 live births to 0.34-0.37, up to 30% of laboring women and their fetuses are exposed to IAP. Complications associated with IAP are significant for both the mother (increased incidence of antibiotic resistance, allergic sensitization, diarrhea including Clostridium difficile, and fungal infections) and neonate (gut dysbiosis, opportunistic infections, and allergic risk). The proposed study will test a low-cost, safe, innovative approach to reduce prenatal colonization with GBS, while adhering to CDC guidelines for EOGBSD prevention. We hypothesize that women who ingest a commercially available oral probiotic combination product (Florajen3, containing Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium lactis, and Bifidobacterium longum) daily from 28 weeks gestation through the time of labor will have a lower risk of GBS colonization compared to women taking placebo. The purpose of this Phase 2 placebo-controlled, double blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to determine the efficacy of once daily ingestion of Florajen3 by healthy low-risk pregnant women from 28 weeks gestation until the time of labor to (a) reduce the proportion of women with GBS colonization and thus (b) reduce the number of women who receive IAP. We expect this intervention to alter the vaginal and rectal microbiota by (c) increasing Lactobacillus colony counts, (d) decreasing GBS colony counts, and (e) reducing GI symptoms. In preparation for this RCT, the research team has conducted two preliminary studies (one in vitro, one in vivo), an integrative review of the literature regarding the use of prenatal probiotics, and a systematic review on probiotics and urogynecologic infections. The literature and preliminary work support the safety, tolerability, and potentially high impact of the oral probiotic as an innovative, low-risk, easy-to-use intervention to reduce GBS colonization during pregnancy and significantly reduce exposure of mothers and infants to IAP and the associated complications. If positive, findings from this study will shift the paradigm in clinical practice and be used to design and conduct a larger RCT to extend the science of nursing, midwifery, obstetrics, microbiology, clinical nutrition, and infectious disease for care of pregnant women and their infants.","Project Narrative The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2010 Guidelines to prevent early onset neonatal Group B Streptococcus (GBS) disease (EOGBSD) require a maternal GBS culture at 35-37 weeks gestation, followed by intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) for up to 30% of women who test positive for this organism. Currently, there are no strategies to reduce the incidence of GBS colonization in pregnant women. If the hypotheses of this study are supported, oral probiotic therapy could provide an effective approach to increase Lactobacillus colony counts, thereby reducing GBS colonization and colony counts during pregnancy, and decreasing maternal-fetal exposure to IAP and its associated complications.",

There are several mechanisms by which low vitamin D status may promote AD pathology, including reduced β-amyloid (Aβ) clearance, dysregulation of calcium influx and glutamate- mediated neurotoxicity. Vitamin D interacts with receptors in the hippocampus and many other brain regions, and has established antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Recent neuroimaging studies have found that low vitamin D levels are associated with increased periventricular white matter disease, reduced white matter volume and larger ventricles. Vitamin D deficiency may also have a toxic effect on brain function independent of Aβ metabolism. Preliminary studies of serum vitamin D levels in a diverse multi-ethnic cohort (n=382) of the UC Davis Alzheimer's Disease Center found a high prevalence of low vitamin D status (61% with levels <20 ng/ml), which was associated with faster rates of decline on executive function and episodic memory. This Phase II randomized clinical trial aims to test if supplementation with high dose oral vitamin D will successfully correct vitamin D insufficiency, compared to treatment with standard (RDA) dose vitamin D in a diverse community-based elderly cohort. The effect of high-dose vs. standard-dose vitamin D on altering cognitive trajectories will also be assessed and data will be expected to be used in designing a potential definitive Phase III trial in elderly groups at risk for dementia. A total of 180 elderly persons with longitudinal biomarkers, neuropsychological testing and brain MRI scans will be enrolled, with 152 (~50 with MCI, 50 with mild AD and 50 with no cognitive impairment) expected to complete the 3½-year study. One-half of each diagnostic group will be randomized to treatment with high-dose vitamin D3 (4,000 IU daily) or to standard dose Vitamin D (600 IU capsule daily + ~200 IU dietary = ~800 IU total/day).

Vitamin D receptor genotype polymorphisms and their impact on response to oral supplementation will also be examined. If vitamin D supplementation improves cognitive outcome, this could have a large impact on the public health, since low vitamin D status is a common, readably treatable condition which may provide a novel window to prevent dementia and AD.

The hypothesis underlying this project is that promoting development of a beneficial, protective gut microbiota by co-administration of prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) and iron- sequestering bovine lactoferrin (bLF) during iron supplementation will prevent iron-induced increases of opportunistic enteropathogens that cause infection and inflammation. The proposed research will extend our established strategy of conjoining investigations in vivo with intestinal fermentation and cellular models in vitro. We will conduct a randomized clinical trial in 6 month-old Kenyan infants in conjunction with mechanistic microbiota studies using our established long-term continuous polyfermenter platform inoculated with immobilized fecal microbiota from Kenyan infants. The period from about 6 months to 1 year of age is vital both for iron nutrition and for the establishment of a healthy gut microbiome that promotes immune system development, local immune homeostasis and limits pathogen colonization. Oral iron supplements are associated with a significant 15% increase in the rate of diarrhea in children in malaria-endemic areas. Our most recent studies have shown that prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) can provide partial amelioration of the adverse effects of iron-induced dysbiosis by enhancing the growth of barrier populations of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. We hypothesize that the combination of prebiotic GOS with bovine lactoferrin (bLF), adding iron sequestration, antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities, will provide virtually complete protection against the adverse effects of added iron on the intestinal microbiota.

The first two funding cycles were dedicated to elucidating the  fundamental mechanisms that induce the ‘alcoholic lung phenotype’. Our experimental findings have  elucidated central roles for oxidative stress (including profound glutathione depletion), zinc  deficiency, and decreased expression and function of PPARγ in mediating the effects of alcohol.  More recently we identified that alcohol inhibits the actions of Nrf2, the transcription factor  that activates the anti-oxidant response element (ARE) and programmatically induces the expression  of hundreds of genes (including those involved in glutathione homeostasis) required to defend  against inflammatory stresses. Moreover, Nrf2 and PPARγ activity appear to be zinc-dependent and  therefore these pathways may be interdependent and therefore coordinately targeted by alcohol.  Remarkably, these same pathways are targeted during chronic HIV infection, and we have determined  that alcohol and HIV- related proteins have additive toxicities on lung epithelial and macrophage  function. As our Center   investigators are also engaged in translational clinical trials in  HIV-mediated lung disease, we have the unique capacity to study the combined effects of alcohol and  HIV and how this combination may pose a challenge to developing effective therapies. These  discoveries have not only revealed the mechanisms by which alcohol renders the lung susceptible to  injury but have also identified candidate therapies targets that Center investigators are testing  in experimental models and clinical trials. This new Project 3 will coordinate and direct our  ‘clinical trials pipeline’ and shepherd discoveries from the laboratory to interventional trials.  The goals of Project 3 are to: 1) Determine the efficacy of dietary supplementation with zinc  and/or SAMe in reversing the alcoholic lung phenotype in subjects with alcohol use disorders and,  in parallel, how regular alcohol use affects the efficacy of dietary zinc + SAMe in reversing lung  dysfunction in individuals living with HIV.  2) Exploit our experimental and clinical translational  studies on alcohol-induced inhibition of PPARγ signaling to conduct a clinical trial to determine  if treatment with the PPARγ ligand pioglitazone can reverse the alcoholic lung phenotype in  subjects with alcohol use disorders. 3) In collaboration with Projects 1 and 2, determine if Nrf2  activators, alone or in combination with zinc, can rapidly reverse the alcoholic lung phenotype in  animal models in vivo and in human alveolar macrophages ex vivo, and translate these studies to a  clinical trial of agents such as sulforaphane, alone or in combination with zinc, in subjects with  alcohol use disorders. Success in any of these trials in our pipeline will have enormous  implications for individuals struggling with alcohol use disorders, including those also living  with HIV.","The Emory Alcohol and Lung Biology Center investigators have been pioneers in the field ever since  its founding members identified that chronic alcohol ingestion causes profound oxidative stress  within the airways and renders even otherwise healthy individuals, including premature infants  whose mothers drank excessively during pregnancy, at high risk for pneumonia and acute lung injury.  Since its formal inception on January 1st, 2003, the Center and its integrated T32 Training  Programs have elucidated the fundamental mechanisms by which alcohol impairs lung function and we  are translating these findings to human studies and novel interventional clinical trials with the  goal of mitigating or even reversing the ‘alcoholic lung phenotype’.  As a result, the Center  attracts world-class scientists from multiple disciplines and is a fertile training environment for  pre- and post-doctoral fellows as well as junior faculty researchers who are expanding and  enhancing the alcohol research field.",

The focus of the Program is directed toward synthetic retinoids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and phytochemicals. However, the scope of the program and depth of expertise have been expanded by strategic recruitment and a mentoring program. Furthermore, transdisciplinary research is nurtured through focused working groups. This program is co- directed by Dr. Craig A. Elmets (Professor and Chair, Department of Dermatology and Director of the UAB Skin Diseases Research Center) and Dr. Clinton J. Grubbs (Professor, Department of Surgery and Director of the Chemoprevention Center). Currently, the program is comprised of 18 members from 10 departments and 5 schools. This program has $4,187,741 in annual direct cost funding, of which 76% is derived from the NCI. In addition to the traditional utilization of inter-programmatic teams and intra-programmatic collaborations, the capabilities of the program are greatly expanded by established extramural agreements: (1) Dr. Grubbs directs Task Order from the NCI PREVENT program which awards contracts to investigators both at UAB and other institutions, and (2) Dr. Elmets participates in an NCI-funded consortium of early phase human chemoprevention trials led by the University of Wisconsin. Over the past four years, the program has produced 206 publications, of which 35% % were intra-programmatic, 28%% were inter-programmatic, and 34% were inter-institutional. A vibrant communications component that includes a seminar series with lecturers from inside and outside the University supports collaborative research among program investigators. Major completed studies at UAB have moved chemopreventive agents from various classes (including rexinoids, cyclooxygenase inhibitors, and dietary polyphenols) to clinical trials during the last few years.","No data",

Low bone mineral density (BMD) in childhood increases the risk of early osteoporosis and bone fracture later in life, which has serious individual and societal implications due to the impaired mobility, the associated morbidity and even mortality in older adults. Our long-term goal is to identify vulnerable pediatri populations at risk for bone loss in order to improve their bone health through an early intervention. This study focuses on the prevention of bone loss that occurs in children and adolescents treated with hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for hematologic malignancies. An increase in bone resorption that occurs after HCT in these patients offers an opportunity for intervention with an anti-resorptive agent, yet no prospective studies have been performed that examine the effectiveness of any bisphosphonate or other anti-resorptive agent in pediatric HCT recipients. Therefore, we propose to conduct a prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial of calcium and vitamin D plus pamidronate versus calcium and vitamin D alone to prevent bone loss after pediatric HCT. The central hypothesis is that subjects treated with pamidronate and calcium and vitamin D (Pamidronate Group) will have higher bone mineral content (BMC) and BMD measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and by peripheral quantitative CT, respectively, at 1 year post-HCT than subjects receiving calcium and vitamin D alone (Control Group). The rationale for this study is that treatment with pamidronate at the time of peak bone resorption can prevent/reverse bone loss and have a positive long-term impact on bone health in pediatric HCT recipients. We will pursue three specific aims: 1) To determine the impact of calcium and vitamin D plus pamidronate versus calcium and vitamin D alone on BMC and BMD following HCT in 60 recipients aged 1-18 years at HCT; 2) To characterize the time course of changes in cytokine levels (IL-6, IL-7, TNF-a) associated with the activation of osteoclasts after HCT and their association with BMC and BMD; 3) To examine the sequence of changes in markers of bone turnover after HCT and their response to pamidronate treatment. The current study is innovative in that it is the first to prospectively evaluate the effects of an anti- resortive agent administered shortly after HCT on BMC and BMD in children. This study is expected to have an important positive impact on bone health in children and the field of pediatric endocrinology by providing much needed prospective data on the effectiveness of an anti-resorptive agent after pediatric HCT. The preventive intervention that this project seeks to examine is likely to have an impact on current clinical practice. While biomarkers of bone turnover have been used in adult studies, there is a striking paucity of data on the clinical applicability of these markers in children and adolescents. Evaluating changes in these markers and cytokines after HCT will provide insight into the underlying mechanisms of bone loss.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hematopoietic cell transplantation is being utilized for an increasing number of both malignant and non- malignant disorders and the overall success rates of the procedure continues to improve. Therefore we are now seeing more and more patients who are survivors, but also more who face the long-term consequences of this very intensive form of therapy. Low bone mineral density is increasingly being recognized as a common consequence of bone marrow transplantation. Since childhood and adolescence are critical time periods for establishing peak bone mass for the rest of the adult life, it is importat to intervene early to prevent bone loss and reduce the risk of early osteoporosis and fracture later in life, which can have a significant impact on functional outcomes, ability to work, as well as quality of life.",

Arterial dysfunction is an important nontraditional CV risk factor gaining increased recognition in the field of nephrology. While many changes likely contribute to the development of arterial dysfunction in patients with CKD, among those of greatest concern is the development of stiffening of the large elastic arteries. This process is best represented, both physiologically and pathophysiologically, by increases in the gold standard measure of arterial stiffening, carotid to femoral artery pulse wave velocity (CFPWV), which reflects, in particular, increases in aortic stiffness. Aortic stiffening with CKD is mediated by structural and functional (increased vascular smooth muscle tone) changes in the arterial wall stimulated by oxidative stress and chronic low-grade inflammation. Caloric restriction (CR) is a promising strategy for prevention of CKD-associated arterial dysfunction and CVD. In this context, we have shown that CR reduces CFPWV and SBP in older mice and in overweight/obese middle-age and older adults. However, long-term adherence to chronic CR regimens with optimal nutrition is very difficult to achieve and unlikely to become clinically relevant in the near future as it may reduce muscle and bone mass. As a result, we have since shown that boosting NAD+ bioavailability to stimulate SIRT-1, a “CR mimetic” approach, reduces CFPW and oxidative stress in old mice, and we recently took the first step in translating these findings in a study of middle-age and older adults with normal kidney function and elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP). We found that supplementation with nicotinamide riboside, a natural, commercially available precursor of NAD+ and novel CR mimetic, was well tolerated and increased NAD+ bioavailability and reduced CFPWV and SBP. Here we propose a randomized, placebo- controlled, double-blind, single-site phase IIa clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of oral nicotinamide riboside (500 mg capsules 2x/day; NIAGEN®; ChromaDex Inc.) for 3 months vs. placebo (n=59/group) for decreasing aortic stiffness and SBP in men and women (35-80 years) with stage III and IV CKD. We hypothesize that treatment will be safe and well-tolerated, and will reduce CFPWV and SBP, as related to increases in systemic NAD+ bioavailability and reductions in oxidative stress, inflammation and vasoconstrictor factors. Aim 1: To measure CFPWV (primary outcome) before/after nicotinamide riboside vs. placebo treatment; Aim 2: To measure casual and 24h-ambulatory SBP (secondary outcome) before and after treatment; Aim 3: To determine the safety and tolerability of treatment with nicotinamide riboside vs. placebo; Aim 4: To measure systemic NAD+ and NAD+–related metabolite concentrations, as well as circulating markers of oxidative stress, inflammation, and vasoconstriction factors before and after treatment.","Project Narrative The proposed research will determine the effectiveness of nicotinamide riboside, a natural supplement and novel alternative approach to mimic the effects of sustained calorie restriction (i.e., “dieting”) for improving the health and function of arteries in adults with moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease. The research also will study the effects on clinic and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure and will provide insight into how nicotinamide riboside improves artery health by assessing novel physiological mechanisms (biological reasons) involved. Overall, the proposed research will provide important new scientific evidence on the effectiveness of mimicking calorie restriction for reducing risk of cardiovascular disease in people with chronic kidney disease.",

However, critical knowledge gaps must be bridged to translate these foundational works into specific, gut microbiota-targeted interventions to reduce CV risk. These include 1) identifying mechanisms by which a selected intervention impacts the vascular endothelial function and mediators of atheroma formation and 2) identifying differences in the impact of a selected intervention on key populations with known differences in gut flora (including sex and obesity status differences). This proposal will address these issues for L. plantarum 299v (Lp299v) supplementation. Our preliminary data in 20 men with coronary artery disease (CAD) suggest that probiotic supplementation with Lp299v has a strong and favorable impact on the vascular endothelium and a strong anti-inflammatory effect on inflammatory cells critical to the development of endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. Our preliminary data suggest obese CAD patients derive the greatest benefit, but whether the favorable impact of Lp299v supplementation systematically differs in women or in obese humans with CAD remains unknown and will be the foci of Aims 1 and 2. Our preliminary data also show improved endothelium dependent vasodilation and reduced systemic inflammation occur concomitantly with changes in the concentrations of circulating short-chain fatty acid (SCFAs)– known systemic metabolic products of the gut microbiota. In animal models, SCFAs cause endothelium-dependent vasodilation by activating G protein-coupled receptor 41 (FFAR3). Whether this novel mechanism is relevant in humans with CAD remains unknown. Our preliminary data shows Lp299v supplementation increases circulating propionate, a three-carbon SCFA. Additionally, post- supplementation plasma reversed impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation in resistance arteries from CAD patients in an eNOS- and FFAR3-dependent manner. FFAR3's role in endothelium-dependent vasodilation responses to Lp299v is a focus of in Aim 2. In Aim 3, we will test whether Lp299v supplementation reduces pro-inflammatory signaling in human mononuclear cells known to contribute to atherosclerosis formation and disease activity and whether FFAR3 activity is involved in this effect. The application employs an innovative mix of translational investigations. We combine a randomized clinical trial to study sex- and BMI-specific effects of Lp299v on vascular function using brachial artery ultrasound with critical molecular and pharmacological studies targeting FFAR3 expression and activity in intact human vessels and mononuclear cells. Additionally, we will employ innovative plasma-induced transcription studies and pathway analyses to determine the impact of supplementation on whole genome transcription in human mononuclear cells [lymphocytes (T-cell, B-cell, and NK cells) and monocytes] to determine how Lp299v impacts key regulatory pathways involved in human vascular inflammation, atheroma formation, and plaque stability.","Recent human studies report an emerging, novel relationship between the gut microbiome and its metabolites with the development of heart attacks and strokes. This application seeks to determine whether supplementation with L. plantatum 299v can improve blood vessel function and reduce inflammation in both men and women as well as obese and non-obese individuals and additionally determine if the favorable effects of L. plantarum 299v are mediated through a novel receptor (FFAR3). Our findings would support the potential L. plantatum 299v to improve cardiovascular health in humans.",

Recent findings from the Physicians’ Health Study II, the only large-scale clinical trial of a daily multivitamin, indicated a significant reduction in cataract, but an elevated, though statistically non-significant, increased risk of AMD. These findings in men require confirmation in other men and extension to women. The proposed study will utilize resources and data from the COcoa-Supplement and Multivitamins Outcomes Study (COSMOS), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2x2 factorial trial testing a patented, high-quality cocoa extract supplement (Mars Symbioscience) and Centrum Silver multivitamin (Pfizer) in the prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer among 12,000 women aged ≥65 years and 6,000 men aged ≥60 years with 4 years of treatment and follow-up. Woman participants will be drawn from the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) cohort, and male participants will be drawn from a target population screened for participation (but not randomized) in the VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL). Beginning in June, 2015 and continuing through 2016, willing and eligible respondents to an invitational mailing will be enrolled in a 3-month run-in. Those who demonstrate good compliance with pill taking during the run-in, and remain willing and eligible, will be randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups for 5 years. At 1-year intervals, participants will receive a new supply of pills and a follow-up questionnaire on compliance, possible side effects, and incidence of endpoints. We propose to document incident cataract and prevalent and incident AMD endpoints in the COSMOS cohort in order to evaluate the efficacy of multivitamin and cocoa extract supplements in cataract and AMD prevention. The primary aims of the proposed study are to test whether 1) a daily multivitamin will reduce the risk of cataract; 2) a daily multivitamin will reduce the risk of total AMD events, a composite of incident AMD plus cases of progression to advanced AMD (neovascular AMD plus central geographic atrophy) among participants with prevalent AMD at baseline. The effect of cocoa extract supplements (capsule containing 750 mg/d flavanols, including 75 mg (-)-epicatechin, and 90 mg theobromine) in reducing risks of AMD and cataract will be examined as secondary aims. This research is responsive to a program priority of the National Eye Institute’s Strategic Plan to improve diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of eye disease. We believe the proposed eye disease ancillary to COSMOS offers a unique opportunity to obtain a reliable, efficient, and informative evaluation of the efficacy of two extremely promising preventive agents for cataract and AMD at a fraction of the cost of separate trials.","PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite the wide-spread usage of multivitamin supplements, and the growing enthusiasm for cocoa supplements, definitive data on the balance of risks and benefits of these agents are lacking.

This growing public health problem extends beyond ARDS, and affects all intensive care unit (ICU) survivors. A substantial proportion of these patients will also have impairments in executive function, which is a cognitive domain fundamental to living a productive life. LTCI and executive dysfunction has devastating consequences for the patient as they become debilitated, have poor health-related quality of life, and have a reduction in employment. Unfortunately, interventions that preserve long-term cognition and executive function after critical illness are lacking. Early, high-dose oral Vitamin D treatment may preserve long-term cognition and executive function in ICU survivors by attenuating systemic and central nervous system inflammation, as well as subsequent endothelial dysfunction, blood brain barrier (BBB) injury, and neuronal cell death. Therefore, we propose this randomized control trial to evaluate the effects of Vitamin D treatment on cognitive outcomes among critically ill patients at risk for ARDS and have Vitamin D deficiency (plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D < 20 ng/ml). Our trial, entitled Vitamin D to Improve Outcomes by Leveraging Early Treatment: Long-term Brain Outcomes in Vitamin D Deficient Patients (VIOLET-BUD), has the following specific aims: (1) Determine if early administration of a single, high dose (>540,000 IU), enteral vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) treatment improves 6-month global cognition and executive function as determined by comprehensive neuropsychological testing compared with placebo; and (2) Determine if serum biomarkers of systemic inflammation (IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, C-reactive protein [CRP]), endothelial dysfunction (E-selectin), and BBB injury (S100B) are associated with poorer 6-month global cognition and executive function and determine if they are mediators for any relationships observed between Vitamin D treatment and these cognitive outcomes. VIOLET-BUD is an ancillary study to the Vitamin D to Improve Outcomes by Leveraging Early Treatment (VIOLET) randomized controlled trial which is actively enrolling and is supported by the Prevention and Early Treatment of Acute Lung Injury (PETAL) network. VIOLET (parent study) will provide the infrastructure needed to screen, randomize, and administer the treatment within 12 hours. VIOLET-BUD will provide the funding and resources necessary to collect additional baseline cognition, functional status, and employment data, additional blood specimens during hospitalization, serum biomarker measurements, and 6- month cognitive and secondary outcome measurements. By leveraging VIOLET and the PETAL network’s massive resources, VIOLET-BUD is a unique opportunity to efficiently evaluate the effects of Vitamin D treatment on cognition that is currently unaddressed the parent VIOLET trial.","Narrative Three out of four survivors of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) will develop long- term cognitive impairment and executive dysfunction.

Most active TB cases arise in adults as a consequence of reactivation of a latent TB infection (LTBI) acquired in childhood. An estimated 2.3 billion people have LTBI, including 10-15 million people in the US. WHO aims to eliminate TB as a public health problem by 2050, and this will require measures to prevent acquisition of LTBI. Vitamin D has long been known to enhance innate immunity to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), and Phase 2 clinical trials show that vitamin D supplementation enhances innate immune resistance to MTB infection. We propose to conduct a Phase 3 double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial to determine whether vitamin D supplementation reduces risk of acquisition of LTBI in 7,350 uninfected schoolchildren aged 6-15 years in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, where rates of LTBI acquisition in children are particularly high as is vitamin D deficiency. Study medication will be administered over 3 years as 72 directly observed bi-weekly oral doses of 28,000 IU Vitamin D3 or placebo. We will employ a well-validated interferon-gamma release assay to determine whether participants have acquired LTBI at 3 years of follow-up (primary outcome). There is professional consensus, as highlighted in recent editorials in the Lancet [2011; 377:189-90] and PNAS [2011; 108, 18861-18862], that the trial we propose needs to be conducted. The PNAS editorial concludes that 'It is a tragic irony that vitamin D, which costs a penny a day and may enhance innate and acquired immunity to TB, is not considered a worthy investment for critical clinical trials that could determine whether supplementation can prevent disease.' The results of this trial will inform global TB control policy by determining whether vitamin D supplementation prevents acquisition of LTBI. More than one billion people worldwide are Vitamin D deficient, and supplementation is safe and inexpensive: intermittent bolus doses of vitamin D are effective in correcting deficiency, are inexpensive, easy to administer, have a very low incidence of adverse effects and much higher degree of acceptability than vaccines and antibiotics. The results of our trial will be readily generalizable to the vitamin D deficient populations at risk of TB worldwide and to the billions already infected with LTBI.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tuberculosis is posing a global emergency; an astonishing one-third of the global population, including 10-15 million people in the United States, are afflicted with a latent TB infection from Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

In addition, an “Acute” DILI protocol with collection of serial early biological samples for mechanistic biomarker studies was developed and implemented. Other network aims included investigation of the role of genetic polymorphisms in DILI susceptibility and outcome, development of improved causality assessment methods, and expansion of the LiverTox website. The University of Michigan team led by Dr. Fontana has played an important role in the design, implementation, and analysis of the primary and ancillary DILIN studies since its inception in 2003. Michigan has not only been a leading enroller in all of the ongoing Registry studies but also provided important leadership in multiple DILIN committees and initiatives. The Michigan team now proposes a series of novel and feasible study aims for the DILIN renewal. The PRIMARY AIM of this proposal is to continue to recruit and enroll high causality adult and pediatric DILI cases into the registry studies for genetic, immunologic, biomarker and mechanistic studies. The Michigan Hepatotoxicity Network has specific plans to increase the enrollment of ethnic minorities via the engagement of hepatologists/ collaborators in southeastern Michigan and elsewhere that care for a large number of African American, Hispanic, and Asian patients. In addition, further development of natural language processing algorithms to search the EMR at the University of Michigan are proposed to facilitate enrollment. Qualitative, quantitative and toxicological studies of the chemical constituents in the herbal and dietary supplement (HDS) products implicated in a growing proportion of DILI cases will be expanded via an ongoing collaboration with the National Center for National Products Research. The SECOND AIM of this proposal is to conduct pilot/ feasibility clinical trials to improve the outcomes of patients with severe acute DILI and those at risk for developing chronic DILI. Proposed study designs include a 12 week course of a simple and safe, orally administered anti-inflammatory or anti-oxidant agent (e.g. budesonide, SAMe, vitamin E) in selected patients with severe acute DILI at risk for adverse outcomes. In addition, 12 to 24 week studies of a safe and effective orally administered anti- cholestatic agent such as an ileal apical bile salt transport inhibitor that may reduce serum bile acids are proposed for subjects at risk of chronic DILI. Lastly, prospective studies of magnetic resonance elastography and MRCP imaging are proposed to improve our understanding of the severity and natural history of DILI. The THIRD AIM of this proposal is to further expand the LiverTox website to include additional chapters on HDS DILI, develop and implement a computerized causality assessment instrument, and assemble working committees to insure that the website content remains up to date and pertinent. Finally, additional collaborations between DILIN and the US FDA and other regulatory agencies are proposed to enhance the pharmacovigilance capabilities of DILIN for new causes of DILI and temporal changes over time.","PROJECT NARRATIVE The University of Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network proposes to improve our understanding of the etiologies, risk factors, and outcomes of DILI via the continued enrollment of adult and pediatric patients including targeted enrollment of ethnic minority patients that will help determine if there are racial differences in DILI susceptibility and outcomes via analysis of collected biological samples, DNA, liver tissue, and clinical data. Pilot/ feasibility clinical trials of simple, safe and mechanistically based treatments for patients with severe acute DILI and those at risk for developing chronic DILI are also proposed. Finally, further development and enhancement of the LiverTox website is proposed to include additional chapters on HDS DILI, development and implementation of a computerized diagnostic instrument, and expansion of the pharmacovigilance capabilities of DILIN.",

Obesity is a complex disorder and there are likely multiple causative factors emerging at various times through life. We have previously demonstrated in preclinical studies that offspring have altered metabolism when the fetuses are exposed to the consequences of maternal obesity in utero. The major effects relate to how the offspring metabolize energy and store excess energy. Offspring of obese women can spare and store more ingested energy as excess fat than offspring of lean women who burn more of their energy. Preliminary data from our ongoing clinical studies show that offspring of overweight women have increased fat mass at age 2 weeks and increased weight at age 2 years. One in two American infants will have been exposed to adverse metabolic conditions while developing in utero, and this increases the risk of developing obesity later in life. Although weight loss prior to pregnancy would be the preferred line of action, in light of the high incidence of unplanned pregnancies and the low success rate of significant weight loss among women, one critical strategy is to develop interventions during pregnancy to prevent childhood obesity.  The objective of this proposal is to test an intervention that would reduce the effect of maternal obesity on the offspring and therefore prevent their risk of developing childhood obesity. The proposed study will test the efficacy of probiotics supplementation during pregnancy on preventing childhood obesity. To test these hypotheses we have designed a prospective randomized double blinded control trial. For this study we will recruit 104 obese women within the first 12 weeks of gestation and follow them throughout pregnancy and during their child's first two weeks of life. The obese women will be randomized to either a placebo (N=52) or to an intervention group (N=52). The intervention group will consist of a daily probiotic supplementation, whereas the control group will be administered a placebo. During the length of the study we will: carefully quantify maternal and child adiposity (fat mass); study maternal metabolism (dietary intake and energy expenditure); acquire dietary intakes and evaluate circulating levels of key metabolic markers. The specific aims will first demonstrate the potential for a probiotic intervention during gestation to improve maternal glucose use in obese women. For this aim, maternal fasting glucose and insulin levels will be assessed throughout pregnancy in the intervention group compared to the placebo group. The specific aims will also test whether a probiotic intervention during pregnancy in obese women alter offspring fat mass and decrease the risk of obesity in the offspring. To answer these questions, placenta, umbilical cord and cord blood will be obtained to study glucose, insulin and gene expression.","No data",

Maternal smoking during pregnancy adversely affects lung development as seen by lifelong decreases in pulmonary function and increased risk of asthma. In a randomized controlled trial (RCT), published in JAMA, we have provided evidence that maternal vitamin C supplementation (500 mg daily during pregnancy) can decrease the effects of maternal smoking during pregnancy on offspring lung function and the subsequent incidence of wheeze. The purpose of this ECHO application is to combine the offspring from the prenatal cohorts of two RCTs studying the effects of vitamin C supplementation to pregnant smokers on offspring respiratory outcomes and to determine if the innovative therapy of maternal vitamin C supplementation during pregnancy leads to prolonged improvements on offspring’s pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and respiratory health. To begin to understand mechanisms by which prenatal vitamin C may be preventing changes in the health of offspring of smokers, we examined gene specific DNA methylation from a subset of placentas, cord bloods and buccal swabs (ages 2-5) collected from subjects who were the offspring of prospectively-followed pregnant placebo- treated smokers, vitamin C-treated smokers, or non-smokers. In parallel with the effects of vitamin C on the reduction of the effects of maternal smoking on offspring PFTs and wheeze, the supplementary vitamin C prevented the majority of significant changes in DNA methylation induced by maternal smoking in both placentas and cord blood. Strikingly, this prevention of alterations in DNA methylation was still evident 2-5 years later in offspring buccal swabs. This preliminary data suggests that the mechanism underlying vitamin C’s prevention of some of the effects of maternal smoking on offspring pulmonary health involves the prevention of epigenetic changes induced by maternal smoking. Thus this application has 4 specific aims: 1, to create the combined cohort of offspring from the 2 RCTs of vitamin C supplementation to pregnant smokers; 2, to determine if the protective effects of maternal vitamin C supplementation to pregnant smokers on offspring pulmonary health extend to early adolescence; 3, to begin to characterize the epigenetic mechanisms that appear to underlie the effects of smoking during pregnancy on offspring lung health and on the protective effects of vitamin C; and 4, to gather core data for and interact with the overall ECHO study. Respiratory health will be assessed by longitudinal semi-annual, validated respiratory histories and yearly PFTs beginning at 3 years of age. Buccal swabs will be collected yearly and blood at 6, 9 and 12 years to provide DNA for genetic analysis. DNA methylation changes will be measured by methylation chips and bisulfite sequencing. This study will address how smoking during pregnancy affects respiratory outcomes, provide mechanistic and therapeutic insights, and provide subjects and data to ECHO to address other key outcomes.","Narrative Maternal smoking during pregnancy is the largest preventable cause of childhood respiratory illness, and children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy show lifetime decreases in pulmonary function and increased respiratory illnesses and asthma. Sadly, more than 50% of smokers who become pregnant continue to smoke and approximately 20% of expenditures for childhood respiratory illness are caused by maternal smoking amounting to over $1 billion annually in current health care dollars. The purpose of this ECHO application is to combine two prenatal cohorts to study the effects of maternal smoking during pregnancy on respiratory outcomes, determine if the innovative therapy of maternal vitamin C supplementation during pregnancy leads to prolonged improvements on offspring’s pulmonary function tests and respiratory health, and to interact with the greater ECHO cohort to promote childhood health and well-being.",

Most asthma is diagnosed before the age of six. Thus, prenatal and early life exposures play an important role in the development of asthma and allergies. On the basis of finding an inverse association between family size and atopy, it was postulated that reduced microbial exposure in early life explains the epidemic of allergic diseases (the “hygiene hypothesis”). The original hygiene hypothesis has undergone changes and refinement, and is now taken to mean not just simply a reduced microbial exposure, but perhaps changes in the breadth and types of microorganisms coupled with changing environments. The gut flora is, quantitatively, the most important postnatal source of microbial stimulation of the immune system. Significant differences between the gut flora of children in industrialized and developing nations suggest that the high prevalence of asthma in affluent nations may be due to changes in the intestinal flora of young infants. This concept of “dysbiotic drift,” whereby environmental forces related to Westernized lifestyles leads to a shift of the developing microbiota away from the norm, may explain why many chronic inflammatory conditions, such as asthma, are associated with Westernized lifestyles. Dysbiosis is a potential mechanism by which the environment interacts with the early developing immune system to program risk for chronic disease. While there are a growing number of studies that are investigating the role of the intestinal microbiome in asthma, these have examined stool samples obtained at one point in time. Since the intestinal microbiome undergoes rapid changes before it becomes established between the ages of 1 and 3 years of life, longitudinal studies are needed. Additionally, no studies have accounted for the host genetic background, which may determine both the development of dysbiosis and who develops asthma when faced with dysbiosis. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that vitamin D deficiency in the pre-, peri-, and immediate post-natal periods, in addition to host genetic influences, lead to intestinal dysbiosis in early life. Dysbiosis, in the proper host genetic context, then increases the risk for development of asthma. While we have collected information on a host of other relevant exposures, this proposal will focus on vitamin D as the primary exposure of interest. We have put together 2 vitamin D clinical trial populations – Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART) and Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood (COPSAC2010) – with prospective collection of exposures during pregnancy and early life, that we will leverage to test our hypotheses. This proposal is in response to FOA RFA-OD-16-004, Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) Pediatric Cohorts (UG3/UH3). In these cohorts, we will first determine the patterns of change in the early intestinal microbiome (both composition and metabolic function) up to age 6 years that are related with vitamin D deficiency in the prenatal and perinatal periods. We will also investigate genetic markers of the host that affect these patterns in the intestinal microbiome. We will then investigate the relationship of these patterns of change in the microbiome with the presence of asthma by age 6 years. Findings from this project will point to potential mechanisms by which early environmental exposures interact with the developing intestinal microbiome and the host to confer risk for asthma.","PROJECT NARRATIVE Asthma and allergies are the most common chronic disorders in children. There is a lack of understanding of the risk factors and mechanisms that lead to asthma and allergies. We will investigate the role of two novel risk factors – vitamin D and the intestinal microbiome – on the risk of asthma and allergies in the child, and findings from this important and efficient study could form the basis for development of new and important approaches to reduction of these conditions.",

Folic acid appears to protect against ASD especially in mothers and children who are genetically susceptible to inefficient folate-dependent one-carbon and methylation metabolism, but this finding needs replication. In addition to being essential for neurodevelopment, folate is a primary methyl-donor for methylation reactions, including DNA methylation. The time near conception is an especially critical period for adequate methyl supply during cycles of active demethylation and re-methylation of the genome during embryogenesis. Our preliminary data show that folic acid supplementation is associated with even greater reductions in ASD risk, by 75%, in younger siblings of children with ASD. In addition, we found DNA methylation differences associated with no maternal use of folic acid supplements in birth tissues (placenta and cord blood) for genes with nuclear regulatory and brain development functions that could have implications for ASD.  The goal of the proposed work is to leverage data and samples from mother-child pairs in two large prospective pregnancy cohorts of high-risk infant siblings to examine specific pathways for prevention of ASD through maternal dietary and supplemental folate intake. This work will build on previous studies by examining exposures collected prospectively, with more accuracy in terms of timing and dose. We will be first to examine whether other methyl-donor B-vitamins have associated effects. We will include information on dietary and supplemental folate and B-vitamin intake from validated instruments, and measurements from maternal first trimester serum, cord blood, and fetal placental tissue. We will examine folic acid interactions with genetic susceptibility factors. Finally, we will increase understanding of the underlying mechanisms by identifying DNA methylation changes associated with folate status, and investigate whether these changes overlap with methylation patterns observed in autistic brains, using innovative methods, multiple platforms, and replication across tissue type and study population, to address challenges associated with DNA methylation measurement. Through completion of the proposed project, we will gain a better understanding of how strongly folic acid is associated with reduced risk of ASD in high-risk families, when intake is most associated and at what levels, how this association differs based on genetic susceptibility, and whether maternal folic acid intake alters DNA methylation profiles in ways that could decrease ASD risk. These findings will have great clinical and public health implications, informing autism prevention trial and ultimately changes in recommendations and policy.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Through completion of the proposed project, we will gain a better understanding of how strongly folic acid and other B-vitamins are associated with reduced risk of ASD in younger siblings within high-risk families, when intake is most associated and at what levels, how the folate association differs based on genetic susceptibility, and whether maternal folic acid intake alters DNA methylation profiles in ways that could decrease ASD risk.

Abstract   Alaska Native (AN) children experience high rates of early rickets and vitamin D deficiency compared with  other US populations. Pregnant AN women from Alaska`s Yukon Kuskokwim (YK) Delta have increased  rates of vitamin D deficiency associated with transition from a traditional marine diet. Alaska Native  children from the YK Delta experience one of the highest reported rates of early childhood caries (ECC). A  Canadian study showed an association between low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels in prenatal  women and ECC in their infants. We evaluated the association between YK Delta prenatal 25(OH)D  levels and ECC in their children using data from the 'Maternal Organics Monitoring (MOM) Study”, and  children's electronic dental records to assess ECC by decayed missing and filled teeth (dmft) scores. In  the analysis, children 24-35 months of age with cord blood 25(OH)D <12 ng/ml had a mean dmft score 2.4  times higher than non-deficient” children (p=0.003). There is limited information on the impact of prenatal  supplementation improving vitamin D concentrations in pregnant women and no information on the impact  on ECC. With available evidence, it is unclear whether vitamin D supplementation should be prescribed as  part of routine antenatal care. Therefore, the current American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists  recommends only the 400 IU of vitamin D in prenatal vitamins. Data in YK Delta women from the MOM  study (2000-2010) showed 91% of 25(OH)D cord blood levels were <20ng/ml (insufficient), and 53% were  <12ng/ml (deficient). In Fall 2015, YK Delta Regional Hospital (YKDRH) evaluated 25(OH)D in prenatal  women – 60% were insufficient (<20ng/ml). In Fall 2016 YKDRH implemented guidelines to add 1000 IU  of daily vitamin D to routinely recommended prenatal vitamins (400 IU) and calcium (200 IU). The recent  Vitamin D supplementation guidelines in YK Delta offers an opportunity to evaluate the impact of prenatal  supplementation on 25(OH)D concentrations and ECC. We propose a cohort study using the electronic  health records and dental records to evaluate: 1) the effectiveness of prenatal vitamin D supplementation  in increasing 25(OH)D concentrations to sufficient levels, 2) the association between deficient prenatal  (25(OH)D concentrations and ECC, and 3) the impact of prenatal vitamin D supplementation on ECC. We  will test the difference in 25(OH)D levels at first prenatal visit and third trimester in women before and after  enhanced vitamin D supplementation, and measure factors associated with compliance. We will evaluate  mean dmft scores between non-deficient and deficient Vitamin D groups, and before and after  supplementation. and explore the relationship of covariates. This Information will help clinicians make  decisions about prenatal vitamin D supplementation in YK Delta and other high risk populations.","No data",

Few novel therapeutics have been approved for targeting airway smooth muscle relaxation or lung inflammation in the last 40 years. Recent studies found that 60% of moderate asthmatics and 70% of severe asthmatics report using complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) to self-treat their asthma symptoms. The exact mechanism of action of these agents is unclear but may involve attenuation of allergic response (IgE levels), anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, and/or direct effects on airway smooth muscle. Clinical trials with chronic oral ginger therapy have demonstrated safe consumption of 2g per day for 28 days which resulted in the successful detection of the active components of ginger in human plasma and demonstrated an anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory effect in human colon cancer and other inflammatory diseases in vivo and in airway cells in vitro. Thus, our central hypothesis is that ginger will prove efficacious in improving clinical symptoms of asthma and improve the tolerance to an inhaled methacholine bronchoconstrictive challenge due chronic reduction of lung inflammation. We will address two primary biological signatures that reflect the hypothesized mechanism of action of ginger components (i.e. inhibition of phospholipase C); (1) an increased tolerance to inhaled methacholine; and (2) a reduction in exhaled nitric oxide, a measure of lung inflammation. The specific aims are (1) to demonstrate the beneficial effects of oral ginger by an improved tolerance to inhaled methacholine over a 56 day study period; (2) demonstrate an improvement in lung inflammation reflected in reduced exhaled nitric oxide, eosinophilia and serum cytokine levels; (3) demonstrate the bioavailability of metabolites of the active components of ginger shown to have the largest inhibitory effect on phospholipase C; and (4) demonstrate the absence of adverse events and optimal dosing and dosing frequency. This proposal (a) is a pilot study to test a natural botanical substance widely used as a dietary supplement for which sufficient early stage data justifies further clinical testing, (b) measures the bioavailability and the natural product’s mechanism of proposed action will be assessed, (c) stems from compelling preclinical evidence for a potential health benefit, (d) investigates a natural substance widely used by the American public as a dietary supplement, and (e) is performed in a human clinical population with objective outcome measures of a biological signature.

At present the treatment options for COPD are limited and new therapies are needed to treat/prevent progression of COPD. Environmental factors and host response leading to imbalance in the ratio of oxidants to antioxidants, and proteases to antiproteases leading to chronic inflammation and tissue destruction is thought to play crucial role in development and progression of COPD. Quercetin is a plant flavonoid and has potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Quercetin supplementation decreased markers of oxidative stress and inflammation in the plasma of patients with another chronic lung disease, pulmonary sarcoidosis. Quercetin also decreased both oxidative stress and lung inflammation in a preclinical model of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However the impact of quercetin in altering biological signatures in COPD subjects is yet to be determined. The proposed study is conducted in two phases, R61/R33 to define and confirm the biological effects of quercetin in COPD, bioavailability, safety, identification of the appropriate biological signatures which reflect clinical outcomes in COPD. This study will also define the optimal dose of quercetin required for altering biological signatures favorably. This information is necessary to conduct the future clinical trials with quercetin in COPD patients. In R61 Phase, there will be 15 study participants with moderate COPD with FEV1 ranging between 45 and 70 % of predicted and they will be randomized to receive either placebo or quercetin 2000 mg/day for 6 months. In R33 phase there will be 35 COPD subjects, who will be randomized to receive placebo, or one of the 3 quercetin doses, 500, 1000 or 2000 mg/day. Outcome of R61 phase will determine the feasibility of R33 Phase.  In both R61 and R33 phases, all subjects will be characterized using a validated symptom questionnaire, medication and smoking histories, analysis of co-morbidities, and physical examination. All subjects will be asked to go on a low quercetin diet 7 days prior to start of quercetin or placebo supplementation to until the end of trial. Blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) will be collected after 7 days washout period (run-in) and after study drug treatment. Blood will also be collected at 3 months of study drug treatment. Plasma and BAL quercetin levels, markers of inflammation and oxidative stress in blood and BAL will be measured. Pulmonary function, and blood profiles (CBC and CMP) will be performed at run-in and at 3 and 6 months of study drug treatment to assess the safety.

"5","R61","AT009622-02","Exploratory Pilot Studies to Demonstrate Mechanisms of Preventing Antibiotic-Associated Diarrhea and the Role for Probiotics","","31-Aug-2020","FRASER, CLAIRE M.; MERENSTEIN, DANIEL J","UNITED STATES","255890","2019","AT","Abstract Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host. One of the most common indications for probiotic treatment is the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). Unfortunately, the efficacy of many probiotic products used for AAD is not supported by rigorous independent research, and non-evidence-based clinical usage is common. Data from several studies suggest antibiotic-induced disruption of commensal colonic bacteria results in a significant reduction in short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production and a concomitant reduction in Na-dependent fluid absorption, ultimately resulting in AAD. The probiotic strain Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 (BB-12) has been shown to ameliorate a variety of gastrointestinal disease states and is known to produce acetate – the most abundant primary colonic SCFA – at concentrations of up to 50 mM in vitro. Thus, we hypothesize that the concurrent administration of BB-12 with antibiotics will protect against the development of AAD by the ability of BB-12 to both generate acetate directly, and increase other SCFAs through cross-feeding of certain bacteria in the Firmicutes phylum. For example, Clostridium, Eubacterium and Roseburia use acetate to produce butyrate, another common SCFA. The primary aim of the R61 phase (N=60) is to determine if BB-12 can mitigate antibiotic-induced reduction in SCFA concentration, as reflected in fecal acetate levels. We hypothesize that antibiotics will decrease fecal SCFAs, but BB-12 supplementation will protect against antibiotic-induced SCFA reduction, and/or be associated with quicker restoration to baseline SCFA levels as compared to control. Antibiotic administration also lowers total microbial counts and diversity in the gut microbiota, disrupting the homeostasis of the gut ecosystem and allowing colonization by pathogens. The secondary aim uses 16S rDNA profiling to determine if BB-12 inhibits antibiotic-induced disruption of the gut microbiota. We hypothesize that antibiotics will diminish the overall number and diversity of bacterial species present in the fecal microbiota, and concurrent BB-12 supplementation will minimize antibiotic-induced shifts in the microbiota, and/or will be associated with shorter recovery to baseline microbiota composition as compared to control. In the R33 phase (N=108), to further delineate the effects of BB-12 administration on the antibiotic-depleted gut microbiota, we will evaluate the timing of probiotic administration in four randomly assigned groups: 1) BB-12 yogurt consumed at the same time as the antibiotic; 2) control yogurt consumed at the same time as the antibiotic; 3) BB-12 yogurt consumed four hours after the antibiotic; and 4) control yogurt consumed four hours after the antibiotic. Our long-term goal is to determine the impact of BB-12 on a variety of gastrointestinal disease states and ages. Elucidation of the mechanism(s) of action will be integral in shaping the direction of future translational research on probiotic effectiveness.","Project Narrative Probiotics are commonly used to address gastrointestinal issues, such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea. While some studies have shown that probiotics may help prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea, the mechanism of action behind this effect is unclear. This study will generate valuable mechanistic data and help advance probiotic research forward in a systematic, well-accepted manner.",

It is estimated that obesity is second only to smoking as a cause of premature preventable death. This is largely due to the comorbidities associated with obesity including metabolic syndrome, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Yet, very little progress has been made in the development of treatments to prevent obesity and its comorbidities, and the mechanistic link between obesity and development of comorbidities is not completely understood. Several studies have shown that obese rodents develop tissue vitamin A deficiency, with tissue retinoid concentrations decreasing by a stunning 75-90%, suggesting profound metabolic dysregulation. Findings in cell systems and animal models demonstrate that retinoids regulate adipocyte differentiation and glucose and lipid metabolism and, further, that decreased retinoid concentrations are associated with progressive obesity, insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. Thus, aggregate preclinical data suggest that altered vitamin A metabolism may contribute directly to obesity progression and the development of obesity-related co-morbidities. Critically, the mechanisms underlying this dysregulated vitamin A metabolism remain poorly understood, and the relevance of these preclinical findings to human obesity is unclear. A central premise of this proposal is that altered vitamin A metabolism in obesity is a result of increased inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6 and TNF in metabolic tissues, which regulate the expression of the retinoid metabolizing enzymes CYP26, LRAT, ALDH1A and RDH in adipocytes and various liver cell types. We further hypothesize that this dysregulation of vitamin A metabolism occurs in human obesity as well as in animal models. We will test our hypotheses in two specific aims: 1) to identify the enzymes and the key regulatory signals that control all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) concentrations and vitamin A metabolic flux in human liver and adipose tissue, and 2) to establish whether adipose tissue and liver vitamin A metabolomes are altered in obese humans. We will use our state-of-the-art mass spectrometry methods, innovative metabolic flux experiments and kinetic modeling in specific cell types to characterize the key enzymes that metabolize retinoids in liver and adipose tissue and determine how the activity of these enzymes is altered in obesity. To determine whether tissue retinoids are altered in human obesity, we will conduct a cross sectional clinical study comparing visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue, liver and serum vitamin A metabolomes in obese and non-obese subjects. The proposed studies will lay the foundation for understanding the regulation of vitamin A metabolism in human liver and adipose tissue and for determing how vitamin A metabolism may become dysregulated in obesity contributing to progressive obesity and its co-morbidities in humans. The results will generate unprecedented insight into human retinoid biology and ultimately could lead to targeted therapeutic interventions designed to restore tissue retinoid signaling as a novel strategy for the treatment of obesity and its sequela.","The obesity epidemic is a major public health burden and incurs annual healthcare costs in excess of $150 million in the U.S. alone. Rodent models suggest that obesity is associated with significant tissue vitamin A deficiency which, in turn, contributes to progressive obesity and development of obesity-associated co- morbidities. This project will help define the mechanisms regulating tissue-specific vitamin A metabolism in humans, determine the relevance of preclinical findings to human obesity, and establish whether tissue retinoids may be potential novel treatment targets for obesity and its associated co-morbidities.",

Gut microbial composition and function are amenable to modification by diet. Flaxseed (FS), a whole food commonly consumed as a dietary adjuvant for several purported health effects, is a rich source of the polyphenolic lignans. Structurally similar to endogenous estrogens, lignans have been most widely studied for phytoestrogen effects; however, anti- inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antioxidant effects have also been reported, primarily in animal and cell models. Importantly, to become physiologically available to humans, plant lignans require metabolism to enterolignans by a consortium of gut microbial community members, but not all individuals are enterolactone producers. Plant lignans are converted by the gut bacteria to the primary circulating enterolignan enterolactone (ENL) which can be measured in most body fluids. ENL has been inversely associated with several inflammation-related chronic diseases and, as a bacterial metabolite, has significant potential to impact health. Using existing data and specimens from a completed flaxseed intervention study in healthy, postmenopausal African American (AA) and non-Hispanic White (NHW) women that investigated the impact of the intervention on gut microbial communities, lignan metabolism, and steroid hormone metabolism, we will accomplish the following Aims: 1) In the overall study sample, determine associations between gut microbial community profiles, circulating metabolic profiles, and circulating inflammation-related cytokines for women who are high vs low ENL producers; 2) In a subset of women (n=80; 40 high producers [20 AA, 20 NHW], 40 low producers [20 AA, 20 NHW]), utilize metatranscriptomics to a) characterize the impact of the FS intervention on pre- and postintervention microbial gene expression, b) determine associations between microbial gene expression and circulating metabolites and inflammation-related cytokines, and c) how these associations differ by producer status and race; and 3) In the subset of women in Aim 2, utilize fecal metabolomics to characterize microbial metabolic profiles pre- and post-intervention, and determine associations with microbial gene expression (metatranscriptomics), circulating metabolites, and inflammation- related cytokines. We hypothesize that the FS intervention will modify microbial gene expression and metabolic pathways related to chronic low grade inflammation and these pathways will differ by producer status and for AA and NHW women. The proposed study offers a unique opportunity to characterize changes in microbial function and subsequent modification of circulating metabolic profiles related to chronic low grade inflammation in a generous sample of AA and NHW white women. Given the higher incidence of inflammation related chronic disease in AA, this study will contribute significantly to our understanding of the role of the microbiome in inflammatory metabolic processes.","The proposed research has potential to identify biologic signatures by which dietary components could be leveraged into interventions or treatments to reduce chronic inflammation and immune phenotypes associated with chronic disease.",

One of the most prominent has been the link between gut microbial metabolism of trimethylamine (TMA) moieties from dietary sources (choline, phosphatidylcholine, L-carnitine, etc.) and CVD. Gut microbes metabolize dietary choline to release TMA via the action of cutC TMA lyase. TMA is absorbed and then oxidized by hepatic flavin monooxygenases (FMO3) to form trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). TMAO has been causally linked to atherothrombotic disease in animal models and is predictive of CVD risk in cohort studies. The overall objectives of this R21 proposal are to: 1) determine the feasibility and establish proof-of-concept for the effects of choline bitartrate supplementation on circulating TMAO and endothelial-dependent dilation in middle-aged adults in order to conduct a larger, more comprehensive trial in the future; 2) establish our proficiency in measuring gut microbiota composition and function; and 3) obtain preliminary data for effect size generation. To this end, following a two-week lead-in diet, we will randomize twenty-four middle-aged adults (45-65 yrs) to 4-weeks of choline bitartrate (1000 mg/d) or placebo. Subjects will be provided all of their food with choline and TMA-moiety intake maintained at meal levels intake of the US diet for the duration of the study from our metabolic kitchen to avoid potential confounding through differences in habitual dietary intake of TMA moieties between individuals. Measurements of TMAO concentration by UPLC-MS/MS, flow-mediated dilation using high resolution ultrasound, and gut microbiota composition/function using 16S rRNA pyrosequencing and targeted qt-PCR, respectively will be made before and following each 4-week treatment period. This innovative integrative and translational physiological study will be conducted by an established P.I. and investigative team with extensive experience and a strong record of success performing intervention studies targeting cardiometabolic dysfunction. These studies have significant translational potential as they may advance basic science findings in rodents to humans and provide novel mechanistic insight into observational studies in humans by establishing the effect of dietary choline on endothelial function through its interaction with the host intestinal microbiota. In turn, the gut microbiota may be a key target for therapies that may contribute to the maintenance of a healthy endothelium or treatment of endothelial dysfunction. Importantly, our study also will provide insight into the gut microbiota as important source of inter-individual variability in the increase in TMAO and flow-mediated dilation responses to dietary choline intake. As such, the latter may provide rationale for individualizing nutritional or other interventions that target the gut microbiota as an interface between the food we eat and host physiology (i.e., endothelial function).","Project Narrative Distinct gut bacteria release trimethylamine (TMA) from dietary substrates such as choline. TMA is enters the circulation and is subsequently oxidized in the liver to produce trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). TMAO is predictive of cardiovascular disease risk in cohort studies but whether TMAO contributes to endothelial dysfunction, a key player in the initiation and progression of atherothrombotic disease in humans is unclear. The purpose of the present study is to determine if choline bitartrate supplementation, which increases plasma TMAO concentration, impairs endothelial function in middle- aged adults, a group who are vulnerable to vascular insults from risk factors.",

Elevated circulating levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), increased serum phosphate, and anemia are
associated with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), cardiovascular disease (CVD), and chronic kidney disease
(CKD) progression in children. Current treatment strategies for CKD-mineral bone disorder and CKD-related
anemia include 1,25D, binders, iron, and erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESA). However, 1,25D therapy
further increases circulating and bone FGF23 levels, and iron deficiency and ESA treatment both also
stimulate FGF23 production. A novel paradigm in earlier CKD has been suggested with the use of phosphate
binders with or without an inhibitor of enteral phosphate absorption, when serum phosphate levels are
within the normal range, to lower FGF23 and to raise endogenous 1,25D levels. However, such approach led
to inconsistent results. Therapy with ferric citrate (FC), on the other hand, has been shown consistently to
lower FGF23 and phosphate levels while improving indices of iron metabolism in adults with CKD stages 3-4.
Furthermore, FC decreased serum phosphate levels, improved iron parameters and was well tolerated in
pediatric dialysis patients. Thus, FC may have added value especially for children with pre-dialysis CKD in
whom iron deficiency anemia and elevated FGF23 levels are highly prevalent. Moreover, iron deficiency is a
potent driver of FGF23 production. Therefore, we hypothesize that treatment with FC will lower intact FGF23
levels during a 12-month period in a randomized, double-blinded, two -arms parallel study in 160 pediatric
patients with CKD stages 3-4 and normal serum phosphate levels. The multi-site trial will pursue the following
specific aims: Specific Aim 1: To determine the efficacy of FC to lower serum intact FGF23 levels (primary
endpoint) in pediatric patients with CKD 3–4 over 12 months. Specific Aim 2: To determine the effects of the
interventions on anemia, kidney function, and indices of bone and mineral metabolism (secondary end-points).
Additionally, we will perform pre- and post-treatment bone biopsies to assess bone histomorphometry and
FGF23 expression in a sub-cohort of 24 UCLA patients. Specific Aim 3: To determine the safety and
tolerability of FC in pediatric CKD 3-4 patients. If our hypothesis is confirmed, then a new treatment paradigm
would emerge in which therapy with FC will be initiated early in CKD, when patients are normophosphatemic,
slowing progressive increases in FGF23 and blunting FGF23-associated adverse renal and CVD.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) levels are elevated in early stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in
children and they are associated with CKD progression and cardiovascular disease. Thus, strategies that lower
or limit the rise of FGF23 may lead to a new paradigm for the treatment of CKD-Mineral Bone Disorder. Thus,
early intervention that focuses on control of FGF23 may lead to correcting 1,25D deficiency with replacement
therapy that is associated with further rise in FGF23 levels.",

Dietary factors such high sodium/low potassium diets contribute to the development of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) such as atherosclerosis and high blood pressure (BP). This is important as CVD is the number one killer in the U.S. While the role of these two nutrients on BP is widely accepted, their impact on the vasculature has received less attention. Endothelial dysfunction, characterized by impaired dilation, is an important non- traditional risk factor for atherosclerosis. We have shown that high sodium diets cause endothelial dysfunction, independent of changes in BP (accomplished by testing adults with salt resistant BP). Evidence supporting potassium's beneficial role on vascular health remains unclear although it may be more effective in the presence of a high sodium diet. A purported mechanism responsible for sodium-induced vascular dysfunction is overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulting in reduced nitric oxide (NO) production/bioavailability. It has been suggested that potassium can counteract sodium's effects by reducing ROS. Additionally, high sodium diets have been shown to stiffen the endothelium by increasing abundance of the endothelial sodium channel (EnNaC) while potassium's role on EnNaC is unknown. Our central hypothesis is that dietary potassium will protect the vasculature from sodium's harmful effect by preserving NO and reducing oxidative stress and endothelial cell stiffness.

In addition to the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, recent studies show that approximately 60% of older men and 40% of older women have inadequate vitamin K intakes. Growing evidence indicates that there are important interrelationships between vitamin D and vitamin K on bone. Vitamin D increases intestinal calcium absorption and stimulates production of two proteins, osteocalcin and matrix Gla protein. Vitamin K plays an essential role in activating these proteins so that osteocalcin incorporates calcium in bone and matrix Gla protein inhibits calcification in soft tissues, including the kidney. Both vitamins D and K are important for optimal function of these proteins. Although vitamin D supplements are widely used to improve bone health, trials of supplemental vitamin D alone in reducing fractures showed inconsistent results. Emerging evidence indicates that supplemental D in the context of low vitamin K status is less effective on bone health measures. Therefore, low vitamin K status may account for some of the inconsistencies of trials testing vitamin D and bone health and may contribute to toxicities attributed to high-dose vitamin D such as kidney stones. No previous randomized controlled trials have been adequately powered to test effects of vitamin K status on fracture risk or the interaction of vitamin K status with high-dose, supplemental vitamin D on bone. To fill knowledge gaps, we propose an innovative, ancillary study to the large, NIH-sponsored, VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL). VITAL is testing effects of supplemental vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol, 2000 IU/d), and/or omega-3 fatty acids (fish oil, 1 g/d) in the primary prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease in 25,871 U.S. men (aged ≥50) and women (aged ≥55), including 5,106 African Americans. In this competitive renewal application of “VITAL: Effects on Bone Structure and Architecture,” we will determine whether low vitamin K status, assessed by 3 sensitive biomarkers, modifies effects of supplemental vitamin D on fractures, bone mineral density (BMD) and structure, and secondarily on increases in urine calcium excretion, a risk factor for low BMD and kidney stones. During the first cycle of this grant, we surpassed recruitment goals and collected baseline and 2-yr post-randomization imaging studies for bone density, structure and architecture that will be used in the proposed studies (n=771). In addition, other key VITAL resources will be leveraged including: 16,953 baseline and 6,000 follow-up blood samples; measures of vitamin D, calcium, creatinine and parathyroid hormone; and adjudicated fractures and kidney stones. This proposal provides a unique opportunity to clarify in the largest study of supplemental vitamin D, the interdependencies of vitamins D and K and their roles on fractures, bone health measures, and urine calcium excretion. Findings from the proposed ancillary study will be critical to the interpretation of on-going vitamin D trials and provide new insights to advance clinical care and public health recommendations.","PROJECT NARRATIVE Vitamin D supplements are widely promoted for bone health. Both vitamin D and vitamin K are important for deposition of calcium in bone, but no study has assessed the role of vitamin K status on fracture outcomes in a large randomized-controlled trial of high-dose, supplemental vitamin D. Results from this proposed ancillary study to the large, VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) will fill gaps in knowledge and advance public health guidelines on the interrelationship of vitamin D and vitamin K on bone health and fractures in women and men across the U.S.",

SELECT randomized 35,533 men between 2001 and 2004. PCPT, also a Phase III, double-blind trial, randomized 18,882 men to either finasteride or placebo between 1994 and 1997. Although schedules and requirements varied between the two studies, substantial serum, plasma, white blood cells, and prostate tissue were collected on both, resulting in rich biorepositories. Each had extensive prospective data collections which included diet and dietary supplements, quality of life, physical activity, medications, other cancer diagnoses, cardiovascular endpoints, and treatment adverse events. Although there have been significant scientific collaborations to date, there remain numerous opportunities to further interrogate the clinical database and biobanks. Additionally, serum and plasma measures and extensive genotyping data have already been obtained and are available for other investigators to use.

This study represents an unprecedented opportunity to examine the long-term effects of supplementation with both macro- and micro-nutrients during most of the first 1000 days using a randomized controlled design, and the underlying neural mechanisms of the effects of early nutrition on later behavior.","Project Narrative The proposed study will add to the evidence base for the effectiveness of nutritional interventions during early life, and the long-term return on investment of maternal and child nutrition programs, to inform evidence-based health policy in Ghana and other low- and middle-income countries. Evidence from this study could support investment in maternal and child nutrition as an effective prevention strategy to reduce the burden on the health care system to provide mental health services to adolescents and adults. This is in accordance with the World Health Organization's Mental Health Action Plan 2013-2020 which highlights the importance of implementing strategies for prevention and strengthening information systems, evidence, and research.",

Basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and squamous precancers in-situ (CIS, also
known as actinic keratoses), are the most common of all human neoplasias and contribute significantly to the
national healthcare burden. While existing techniques such as cryoablation or surgical excision are generally
curative, those treatments cause scarring that can be especially disfiguring in patients at high risk for skin
cancer (i.e., patients with chronic severe photodamage; immunosuppression due to organ transplantation; or
Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome, BCNS). Photodynamic therapy (PDT) combines a photosensitizer
(protoporphyrin PpIX, induced by the administration of aminolevulic acid, ALA) with activation by visible light,
and is a completely nonscarring technique. PDT is approved by the FDA for field treatment of widespread
cutaneous precancers, and in European countries PDT is also approved for treating SCC and BCC. In the
U.S. however, approval of PDT for SCC and BCC will require further clinical trials to demonstrate an efficacy
similar to existing techniques (destructive ablation). As a new way to increase PDT efficacy, we showed that in
animal models of SCC and BCC, transient administration of Vitamin D (VD) prior to ALA-PDT enhances PpIX
accumulation and PDT efficacy. The oral (dietary) form of VD (cholecalciferol; D3, given as 10,000 IU/day for
10 days) increases PDT-induced tumor killing by several fold, and is very safe with little risk for inducing
hypercalcemia. In this grant, we propose to test this approach in human clinical trials using oral D3 as a
neoadjuvant to PDT. Aim 1 will examine the relationship between VD status (serium 25OH-D3) and PDT
efficacy for CIS. Subaim 1a is a longitudinal study to test the correlation between serum 25OH-D3 levels and
treatment outcomes in routine PDT patients in our clinics, and to examine the predictive value of certain
biomarkers (e.g. VDR allelic polymorphisms). Subaim 1b is an interventional trial to assess the benefit of
giving neoadjuvant D3 (transient oral D3) prior to PDT. Results from combined D3/PDT treatment (Subaim 1b)
will be compared to results after D3 alone (Subaim 1a), stratified by the VD deficiency status. In Aim 2, we will
examine the potential benefit of neoadjuvant D3/PDT in patients with BCNS (Gorlin-Goltz syndrome). These
patients, who have multiple BCC tumors will receive 3 bimonthly PDT treatments, and rates of tumor shrinkage
will be correlated with serum 25OH-D3 levels. Each patient will serve as his/her own control by randomizing
the order of the first two PDT treatments, one session to be done with neoadjuvant D3 and the other without.
The third PDT treatment will occur after the serum VD level has been adjusted to normal levels with D3
supplements. This approach will allow us to determine whether neoadjuvant D3/PDT can help all patients,
even the VD deficient individuals, through customization of D3 dose. Together, we expect this group of clinical
trials to establish the foundation for a new treatment modality, i.e., neoadjuvant D3/PDT for skin cancer. The
potential benefit for public health is that data showing improved efficacy of PDT with this safe and simple
approach will lay the foundation for a nonscarring alternative to surgery for early SCC and BCC tumors.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
This is a proposal to develop a new combination regimen that combines Vitamin D3 pretreatment with
photodynamic therapy (PDT), as a nonsurgical and non-scarring alternative for the treatment of skin cancer. In
clinical trials, we will test the hypothesis that oral Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) will boost the levels of target
photosensitizer (protoporphyrin IX) in widespread squamous cell precancers and in basal cell carcinoma, and
improve the therapeutic response to PDT. Our study population will comprise patients at high risk, including
organ transplant recipients and patients with the Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome. The potential benefit to public
health is a safe, efficacious, and non-scarring alternative to surgery for the treatment of skin cancer.",

We have previously performed an intervention study using L. johnsonii N6.2 in rodents and found that the administration of the microorganism reduced the incidence of T1D. Translating our rodent studies towards a potential method for T1D prevention in humans required a pilot study in healthy individuals. We conducted a double-blind, randomized clinical trial in 42 healthy individuals with no known risk factors for T1D to evaluate subject responses to the consumption of L. johnsonii N6.2. The administration of L. johnsonii N6.2 was well tolerated in adult control subjects, demonstrated systemic impacts on innate and adaptive immune populations and resulted in a decreased kynurenine/tryptophan ratio. These data provide support for the safety and feasibility of using L. johnsonii N6.2 in prevention trials in subjects at risk for T1D.

More than half of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) develop hypertension (HTN), which doubles
their risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Even though it is well known that insulin resistance and chronic
inflammation lead to HTN and accelerate vascular disease in patients with T2DM, very little is known about the
mechanisms by which these risk factors promote HTN and CVD. Vitamin D deficiency in patients with T2DM is
almost twice that of non-diabetics, and most of the randomized clinical trials evaluating vitamin D
supplementation in uncomplicated T2DM have demonstrated BP reductions, suggesting a possible effect in
this population. Thus, the goal of this application is to identify the molecular mechanisms by which vitamin D
deficiency promotes HTN in the setting of T2DM. Our preliminary data indicates that mice with macrophage-
specific deletion of the VDR (KODMAC) were hypertensive with increased systemic renin, activation of the
macrophage renin angiotensin system (RAS) in the aorta, and renal macrophage infiltration into the
juxtaglomerular (JG) apparatus, the main source of renin production. Peritoneal macrophages from KODMAC
or their media activated JG cell renin production via macrophage secretion of miR106b. This effect was blunted
by lack of macrophage ER stress-regulated (C/EBP) homologous protein (CHOP). Similar effects were found
with macrophages from vitamin D-deficient mice or from vitamin D-deficient patients with T2DM. Thus, we
hypothesize that vitamin D-deficient macrophages increase systemic renin and hypertension in T2DM
via increased secretion of miR-106b, stimulating renin secretion by JG cells, and/or via macrophage
RAS-dependent mechanism. To test this hypothesis, Aim 1 will determine whether bone marrow (BM)
transplant from miR-106b-/- or CHOP-/- into vitamin D-deficient mice improves HTN and decreases systemic
renin. In Aim 2, we will evaluate whether BM transplant from Renin 1c-/- into vitamin D-deficient mice improves
HTN and decreases systemic renin. In Aim 3, we will also assess the role of these inflammatory mechanisms
of HTN in patients with T2DM and vitamin D deficiency by correlating changes in plasma miR-106b levels with
changes in blood pressure after vitamin D supplementation (Aim 3a) and by testing whether monocytes or
serum from vitamin D-deficient diabetics with HTN induce JG cell renin secretion via miR-106b (Aim 3b). This
proposal will identify the mechanisms by which vitamin D deficiency regulates the innate immune system to
induce systemic renin production and HTN in type 2 diabetes and thus, provide new therapeutic targets for
these pervasive diseases.
 ","PROJECT NARRATIVE
 It is well-recognized that chronic inflammation integrates insulin resistance with hypertension and
cardiovascular complications, but the mechanisms are undefined. We found that cell-specific deletion of the
macrophage vitamin D receptor in mice is sufficient to cause renin-dependent hypertension, which corrects
with bone marrow (BM) transplantation of cells with intact VDR. This study will determine whether macrophage
RAS activation and/or miR106b secretion are critical mechanism by which vitamin D-deficiency increased
systemic renin and induce hypertension in a mouse model of insulin resistance and in patients with type 2
diabetes.

Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on
the host. One of the most common indications for probiotic treatment is the prevention of antibiotic-associated
diarrhea (AAD). Unfortunately, the efficacy of many probiotic products used for AAD is not supported by
rigorous independent research, and often results in non-evidence-based usage. Our research group has
worked closely with the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) to move research forward for the most well studied
Bifidobacterium strain, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (B. lactis) BB-12 (BB-12), via an Investigational
New Drug pathway. We have previously conducted two Phase I, safety trials and as per FDA requirements,
are now proposing a Phase II trial that will examine efficacy and monitor safety of BB-12 in preventing AAD.
The investigational product delivers a stable high dosage of BB-12, consistent with the findings of a Cochrane
review for preventing AAD using other strains studied outside of the United States. To explore possible
mechanisms responsible for BB-12 effects in ameliorating AAD, we will also study the gut microbiota
composition and function by collecting five fecal samples at multiple time points from all participants. The gut
microbiota includes hundreds of species of facultative and obligate anaerobes, and its disruption is
hypothesized to be an important factor in the development of AAD.
AIM 1: To test the efficacy of high dose, BB-12-supplemented yogurt in preventing AAD, compared to
yogurt without BB-12, in children receiving antibiotics.
Hypothesis: Children receiving antibiotics who receive the yogurt with BB-12 will demonstrate less diarrhea
than those receiving a control yogurt without BB-12.
AIM 2: To assess the safety of yogurt supplemented with BB-12.
Hypothesis: Yogurt containing BB-12 will be safe and well-tolerated in this larger pediatric population. This is a
Phase II trial that requires additional safety evaluation of high dose BB-12.
AIM 3: To carry out longitudinal community structure and gene expression analysis of fecal microbiota
to evaluate the impact of high dose BB-12 in a pediatric population receiving antibiotics.
Hypotheses: (i) Administration of antibiotics will alter the composition and gene expression profile of the gut
microbiota in pediatric patients, and (ii) concomitant ingestion of BB-12 in yogurt will mitigate the antibiotic-
induced disturbance in the gut microbiota, as identified using 16S rRNA and metatranscriptomic profiling.
Our long-term goal is to determine the impact of BB-12 on a variety of gastrointestinal disease states and
ages, through high-level independent research. Before we proceed with more translational effectiveness
research, this Phase II, pediatric efficacy and safety study is required by the FDA.","Project Narrative
Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in sufficient amounts, may improve health. A
common use for probiotics is for addressing gastrointestinal issues, such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea.

However, SGLT2 inhibitors also have significant undesired side effects – including bone loss as well as increased risk of bone fractures, urosepsis, and ketoacidosis. Significant variability exists in response to these drugs in terms of both efficacy and safety, and there are not currently good ways to identify individuals likely to respond or experience side effects. This application proposes a genome-wide association study in the Old Order Amish population to identify genetic variants that predict individuals' responses to canagliflozin (the most widely used SGLT2 inhibitor) at a dose of 300 mg/day for 5 days. Based on preliminary data from the Principal Investigators' research as well as information from the literature, the proposed project will measure pharmacodynamic end-points related to both the beneficial and adverse effects of SGLT2 inhibitors. The proposal contains two specific aims:  · Aim 1. To identify variants associated with a clinical efficacy biomarker (24 hr urinary glucose excretion)  · Aim 2. To identify variants associated with predictive biomarkers for safety end-points – including, plasma glucagon, ketone bodies, cardiovascular biomarkers (uric acid and blood pressure) and biomarkers of bone health (serum phosphorus, plasma FGF23, plasma 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, and plasma PTH).

Although the adverse effects associated with prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) are well known, many women
continue to drink heavily during pregnancy, putting their infants at risk for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.
Given the limited effectiveness of psychosocial and informational interventions, there is a growing interest in
new approaches, such as nutritional interventions, that may be more effective. Animal studies have shown that
choline supplementation during the equivalent of the 3rd trimester in humans can mitigate effects of PAE on
growth and development. However, findings from studies in humans to date have been inconsistent and
difficult to interpret. Choline, an essential nutrient, serves as a methyl-group donor for DNA methylation and is
a constituent of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and a precursor to major components of cell membranes. In
an R21 feasibility trial, 70 heavy drinkers were randomly assigned to receive a daily dose of 2g of choline or a
placebo from time of enrollment in antenatal care until delivery. Participants were recruited from the Cape
Coloured (mixed ancestry) community in Cape Town, South Africa, where the incidence of heavy drinking during
pregnancy and fetal alcohol syndrome are among the highest in the world. Infants in the choline-treated arm
were more likely to meet criterion for eyeblink conditioning than those in the placebo arm. Infants born to both
the choline- and placebo-treated mothers were small at birth, but those in the choline arm showed
considerable catch-up growth in weight and head circumference by 6.5 mo, which persisted through 12 mo. At
12 mo, infants in the choline arm showed markedly better recognition memory compared to placebo-treated on
the Fagan Test of Infant Intelligence, which is known to have predictive validity for school-age IQ. Key features
of this study included the higher choline dose (4.4 times adequate intake (AI), compared to 1.7-2.5 in previous
human studies) and initiation of treatment early in pregnancy. We propose to recruit heavy drinking pregnant
women from a rural Cape Coloured community to participate in a fully-powered, double-blind, randomized,
placebo-controlled choline supplementation trial (1) to assess the effectiveness of maternal choline
supplementation during pregnancy to mitigate effects of PAE on three primary outcomes: infant recognition
memory and postnatal growth restriction (weight and head circumference); (2) to assess the efficacy of this
supplementation for mitigating alcohol effects on the following secondary outcomes: infant eyeblink
conditioning, postnatal length, and information processing speed; (3) to use innovative methods from causal
inference analysis to examine protocol adherence as an important source of variation in treatment efficacy and
to identify socio-demographic factors associated with non-compliance in order to facilitate implementation of
the intervention protocol in clinical settings; and (4) in exploratory analyses, to examine whether maternal
choline supplementation is particularly effective in women with lower dietary choline intake or poor nutritional
status.

Neural tube defects (NTDs) are among the most common and serious of all birth defects affecting 0.5–1 per 1,000 US newborns, yet their complex etiology remains poorly understood (Wallingford et al., 2013). It is well established that pre-pregnancy supplementation with folic acid can reduce the risk of NTDs, but the underlying mechanism of this beneficial effect is unclear. Approximately 30% of NTDs cannot be prevented by maternal periconceptional folate supplementation. Our preliminary data showed that rare mutations in planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway could increase the risk of NTDs, while mutagens such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were enriched in the placentas of NTDs fetuses/infants. We hypothesized that NTDs are caused by combinations of rare multiple mutations. Higher mutation rates results in a higher NTDs prevalence. It is possible that folic acid can prevent NTDs by reducing the mutation rate. Furthermore, we hypothesize that paternal supplementation with folic acid can further reduce NTD rates. We have a unique opportunity to evaluate folate supplement effect on mutation rate by leveraging previously collected biological samples from NTD patients and controls from several distinct cohorts. Additionally, we propose to use mouse models to better understand the relationship between folate and mutation rates in vivo. The results of this study will provide an explanation of how folate prevents NTDs, and will reveal novel pathways for intervention on folate-resistant NTDs.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Wood smoke particles (WSP) derived from wildland and other fires produce a significant fraction of ambient air particulate matter. Health effects associated with WSP include acute bronchitis, asthma exacerbation, pneumonia, cough and systemic inflammation in in healthy persons and those with asthma. Cardiovascular effects have also been reported with WSP exposure. WSP from wildland fires can cause abrupt increases in ambient air PM 2.5 levels, and avoidance of rapidly increasing PM air pollution is not feasible as many residents cannot leave the burn region, and wildland firefighters move into wildland fire sites, often for several consecutive days. As avoidance of PM is not feasible in these settings, there is a clear unmet need for interventions to reduce adverse health effects caused by acute WSP exposure. Our team has developed gamma tocopherol (gT), an isoform of vitamin E with robust anti-inflammatory actions, as a chemopreventive intervention for inflammation caused by environmental contaminants. Our animal studies show that gT inhibits allergen, ozone and endotoxin-induced airway inflammation. Our human phase I studies show that gT decreases inflammatory response of circulating monocytes, decreases nitrosative stress, and inhibits neutrophil (PMN) influx to the airway in vivo after endotoxin challenge. Thus, gT supplementation is an attractive nutritional/nutraceutical approach to decreasing the adverse health effects of inhaled WSP. We have also developed a 500µg/m3 WSP exposure protocol which induces both airway and systemic increases in PMNs in human volunteers. Using this challenge protocol, we will undertake a randomized, placebo-controlled study to determine if of supplementation with 1200 mg of on WSP-induced airway and systemic PMN increases in healthy and asthmatic volunteers. Exploratory endpoints will include non-specific bronchial reactivity (NSBR), and cardiovascular responses reported to be impacted by PM exposure. These studies will also allow us to compare responses of allergic asthmatic (AA) and healthy volunteers (HV) to determine if atopy or other facets of asthma modify risk for inflammatory response to WSP.

United States military Veterans from recent conflicts are coping with symptoms related to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Many Veterans are resistant to conventional health and mental health interventions (e.g., medication, psychotherapy), and often symptoms are not significantly improved by traditional treatments. Alternative treatment methods are needed. An underlying feature of PTSD is exaggerated inflammation, both peripherally and in the central nervous system, which is thought to play an important role in the vulnerability to, aggravation of, and perpetuation of adverse consequences of this condition. Therefore, an innovative intervention strategy would be the use of anti-inflammatory/immunoregulatory probiotics to reduce inflammation. In this study, we will investigate the effects of an 8-week oral administration of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG; ATCC53103), a probiotic shown to have anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory effects on both biological signatures of systemic inflammatory processes and proximal signatures of probiotic administration. LGG is a commensal organism that colonizes the human gut mucosa and suppresses mucosal inflammation via inhibition of the production of proinflammatory cytokines. The specific aim of the study is to identify the effect of probiotics on systemic inflammation, as well as PTSD symptoms, microbiota composition, gut permeability, stress response, and decision-making. Outcomes will be assessed using a longitudinal, double blind, randomized placebo-controlled design. After initial evaluation procedures to confirm PTSD and Functional Bowel Disorder diagnoses, 59 participants will be randomized to probiotic supplementation and 59 will be randomized to placebo supplementation.

Despite such data, experimental evidence of vitamin D’s direct effects on brain function in humans is all but lacking. This gap hinders both our understanding of the role of vitamin D in human behavior as well as its therapeutic potential for neuropsychiatric disorders (i.e., including and beyond vitamin deficiency states). Recent preclinical (rodent) research by members of our group demonstrate important modulatory effects of the physiologically active form of vitamin D, calcitriol, on mesolimbic dopamine (DA) systems. These data demonstrate: 1) expression of VDRs in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) containing DA neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and dopamine D2/3 receptor-expressing cells in striatum/nucleus accumbens (NAc); and they further show that acute calcitriol administration: 2) increases TH expression in VTA DA neurons; 3) increases dopamine D2/3 receptor mRNA in NAc; 4) increases microdialysate (“tonic”) and cyclic voltammetry (“phasic”) measures of striatal DA release (including in response to amphetamine); 5) increases amphetamine- induced locomotion, and 6) decreases drug (amphetamine) self-administration in animals. If also true of humans, such effects would be of considerable clinical importance, given the number of human behaviors (e.g., learning, memory, reward, affective and information processing, etc.) mediated by mesolimbic/subcortical DA circuits and the number of disorders (e.g., attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, addiction, depression, Parkinson’s disease, etc.) in which mesolimbic/subcortical DA deficits have been implicated. The current exploratory/developmental R01 seeks to test this hypothesis directly in healthy humans. Specifically, we will assess subcortical DA function (in vivo DA release) in 20 medically and psychiatrically healthy (vitamin D sufficient) humans using high-resolution 11C-PHNO PET. Specifically, subjects (N=20) will participate in four 11C-PHNO PET sessions, including two pairs of pre- and post-amphetamine (0.3 mg/kg PO) scans of D2/3 receptor availability (BPND) conducted on two separate days two weeks apart. Scan days will be preceded by placebo/active calcitriol (3.0 µg) pretreatment per a fully randomized, double-blind, counterbalanced, placebo- controlled, within-subject design. We hypothesize that calcitriol will increase amphetamine-stimulated DA release as reflected by greater reductions in ventral striatal D2/3 receptor availability (∆BPND) on active vs. placebo days and that such changes will be accompanied by parallel improvements in DA-mediated behaviors.","Project Narrative Beyond its well-established role in maintaining systemic calcium homeostasis, a substantial and growing body of research points to the physiological importance of vitamin D as a neuroactive steroid in the brain.

Over 80% of children diagnosed with cancer will survive at least ten years after diagnosis. However, by age 50
years each survivor, on average experiences >4 severe or life-threatening (CTCAE grades 3-4) health chronic
conditions (rates typically seen in persons decades older) raising concern for early onset of physiologic frailty.
Frailty is a loss of physiologic capacity that interferes with normal function, most commonly described in older
adults and characterized (Fried Criteria) by three or more of: 1) low lean muscle mass, 2) reduced strength, 3)
slow walking speed, 4) low energy expenditure, and 5) fatigue. In the general population frailty is seen in the
elderly. However, at a median age of only 33 years (range 18-50), 8% of survivors are frail, an additional 22.2%
meet the definition of pre-frail (two of five criteria), rates similar to adults >65 years of age. Cellular senescence,
a quiescent state representing the loss of a cell's ability to replicate or grow, is an important and established
mechanism in the aging process. Senescence is strongly associated with frailty and aging biomarkers in the
elderly population. There is now evidence that p16INK4A is elevated in survivors treated with chemotherapy and
radiotherapy, and the magnitude of elevation is associated with measures of frailty. Thus, cellular senescence
may provide a targetable pathway to improve measures of aging. Agents such as Dasatinib and flavonoids
(Quercetin; Fisetin, available as nutritional supplements) interfere with this pathway and thus are “senolytic”. Six
clinical trials of efficacy are now underway in chronic disease states associated with senescence (e.g. idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis) and frail populations, including adult bone marrow transplant recipients demonstrating initial
evidence for safety and tolerability and that senolytics alleviate physical dysfunction. However, to date, no trial
has evaluated senolytic agents in adult survivors of childhood cancer. In order to address this gap in knowledge,
we utilize the well-phenotyped population of the St. Jude Life Cohort Study to propose a two arm, randomized,
open-label pilot intervention trial in frail survivors (Fried Criteria) of childhood cancer who have diminished
walking speed and increased cellular senescence (increased p16INK4a mRNA expression level in peripheral blood
T lymphocytes). We aim to test the efficacy of two senolytic regimens: 1) combination of Dasatinib plus
Quercetin, and 2) Fisetin alone, to reduce senescent cell abundance in blood and improve walking speed (1°
Aim). Secondary endpoints include: additional measures of frailty beyond walking speed (i.e. additional Fried
Frailty Criteria), markers of inflammation, insulin resistance, bone resorption and cognitive function. We
hypothesize that senolytic therapy will reduce biological markers and clinical measures of aging. Additionally,
we will test the safety and tolerability of these senolytic therapies. If successful, this single-institution pilot study
will: 1) provide first-in-survivor evidence that targeting cellular senescence pathways can modify frailty and
biological markers of aging using brief (two days per month) exposure to senolytic regimens, and 2) provide
strong scientific premise for a large-scale clinical trial of efficacy.","RELEVANCE STATEMENT
If successful, this single-institution pilot study will: 1) provide first-in-survivor evidence that targeting cellular
senescence pathways can modify frailty and biological markers of aging using brief (two days per month)
exposure to senolytic regimens, and 2) provide strong scientific premise for a future large-scale clinical trial of

premature cellular aging and risk for frailty and chronic health conditions.",

CANDIDATE: Christopher R. Martens, Ph.D., is a fellow training in the integrative physiology of aging at the
University of Colorado Boulder. In this K01 application, Dr. Martens aims to study the efficacy of a novel NAD+
boosting and calorie restriction-mimetic compound, nicotinamide riboside (NR), for reducing large elastic artery
stiffness and blood pressure in older adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and to relate these
outcomes to improvements in cerebrovascular, cognitive and neuronal function. His immediate goal is to acquire
the research training and professional skills necessary to transition to an independent investigator. His long-
term goal is to establish his own research program, with a focus on identifying strategies for improving
cerebrovascular and cognitive/neuronal function and reducing risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in older adults.
CAREER DEVELOPMENT PLAN: Dr. Martens proposes to enhance his career development by: 1) acquiring
new skills in the assessment of cerebrovascular, cognitive and neuronal function to support his proposed
research plan; 2) receiving training in aMCI and AD pathophysiology, geriatrics and biostatistics; and 3) refining
his professional skills through formal course work, attendance and presentations at weekly journal clubs,
university seminars, and national scientific meetings, and through regular interactions with his mentoring team.
ENVIRONMENT: Dr. Martens will train in an outstanding aging research environment supported by a multi-
disciplinary team of mentors who will provide him with research and career development training. The primary
mentor, Dr. Seals, is an internationally recognized NIA-funded scientist with a strong record of successful
mentoring in vascular aging research. Co-Mentor Dr. Hughson is a leading expert in cerebrovascular function
and brain aging, and Dr. Bettcher has extensive experience assessing cognitive function in patients with aMCI.
Dr. Banich is director of the neuroimaging center at CU-Boulder and has extensive experience with the
proposed MRI-based assessments of neuronal function and structure. Dr. McQueen is director of biostatistics
at the CU-Boulder Clinical and Translational Research Center (CTRC) and regularly provides mentoring and
consulting to trainees and faculty conducting clinical trials. Co-mentors Dr. Potter and Dr. Schwartz are senior
NIA investigators with expertise in AD and geriatric medicine, respectively, and their mentorship will
complement the research training & objectives. RESEARCH: aMCI is the earliest symptomatic stage in the
development of AD, which is among the fastest growing causes of morbidity and mortality in the US. Stiffening
of the large elastic arteries (i.e., the aorta and carotid arteries) occurs with aging and has been linked to the
development of aMCI and AD, primarily through the transmission of damaging pressure waves to the cerebral
vasculature, resulting in cerebrovascular dysfunction and neuronal damage. The proposed research seeks to
test the efficacy a novel CR-mimicking dietary supplement, NR, for lowering arterial stiffness in patients with
aMCI and associating these changes with improved cerebrovascular, cognitive and neuronal function.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Stiffening of the elastic arteries occurs with aging and likely contributes to memory loss and risk of Alzheimer's
disease, primarily by impacting blood vessels within the brain. This study will provide insight into whether a
new dietary supplement that mimics the beneficial effects of calorie restriction, reduces arterial stiffness,
improves arterial function within the brain and restores brain function and memory in patients with “amnestic”
mild cognitive impairment. Overall, this project has the potential to identify a novel, safe and cost-effective
strategy for decreasing age-related memory loss.",

ABSTRACT
The UAB Cancer Center Chemoprevention Program was established to identify novel chemopreventive agents
capable of preventing cancer, to determine the ability of naturally occurring and synthetic chemicals to prevent
or delay carcinogenesis, to determine their mechanisms of action and identify biomarkers, and to perform early
phase chemoprevention trials evaluating novel chemopreventive agents. The focus of the Program is directed
toward synthetic retinoids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and phytochemicals. However, the scope of
the program and depth of expertise have been expanded by strategic recruitment and a mentoring program.
Furthermore, transdisciplinary research is nurtured through focused working groups. This program is co-
directed by Dr. Craig A. Elmets (Professor and Chair, Department of Dermatology and Director of the UAB
Skin Diseases Research Center) and Dr. Clinton J. Grubbs (Professor, Department of Surgery and Director of
the Chemoprevention Center). Currently, the program is comprised of 18 members from 10 departments and
5 schools. This program has $4,187,741 in annual direct cost funding, of which 76% is derived from the NCI.
In addition to the traditional utilization of inter-programmatic teams and intra-programmatic collaborations, the
capabilities of the program are greatly expanded by established extramural agreements: (1) Dr. Grubbs directs
Task Order from the NCI PREVENT program which awards contracts to investigators both at UAB and other
institutions, and (2) Dr. Elmets participates in an NCI-funded consortium of early phase human
chemoprevention trials led by the University of Wisconsin. Over the past four years, the program has
produced 206 publications, of which 35% % were intra-programmatic, 28%% were inter-programmatic, and
34% were inter-institutional. A vibrant communications component that includes a seminar series with
lecturers from inside and outside the University supports collaborative research among program investigators.
Major completed studies at UAB have moved chemopreventive agents from various classes (including
rexinoids, cyclooxygenase inhibitors, and dietary polyphenols) to clinical trials during the last few years.","No data",

development of atherosclerotic disease and adverse cardiovascular (CV) events. However, critical knowledge
gaps must be bridged to translate these foundational works into specific, gut microbiota-targeted interventions
to reduce CV risk. These include 1) identifying mechanisms by which a selected intervention impacts the
vascular endothelial function and mediators of atheroma formation and 2) identifying differences in the impact
of a selected intervention on key populations with known differences in gut flora (including sex and obesity
status differences). This proposal will address these issues for L. plantarum 299v (Lp299v) supplementation.
Our preliminary data in 20 men with coronary artery disease (CAD) suggest that probiotic supplementation with
Lp299v has a strong and favorable impact on the vascular endothelium and a strong anti-inflammatory effect
on inflammatory cells critical to the development of endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. Our
preliminary data suggest obese CAD patients derive the greatest benefit, but whether the favorable impact of
Lp299v supplementation systematically differs in women or in obese humans with CAD remains unknown and
will be the foci of Aims 1 and 2. Our preliminary data also show improved endothelium dependent vasodilation
and reduced systemic inflammation occur concomitantly with changes in the concentrations of circulating
short-chain fatty acid (SCFAs)– known systemic metabolic products of the gut microbiota. In animal models,
SCFAs cause endothelium-dependent vasodilation by activating G protein-coupled receptor 41 (FFAR3).
Whether this novel mechanism is relevant in humans with CAD remains unknown. Our preliminary data shows
Lp299v supplementation increases circulating propionate, a three-carbon SCFA. Additionally, post-
supplementation plasma reversed impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation in resistance arteries from
CAD patients in an eNOS- and FFAR3-dependent manner. FFAR3's role in endothelium-dependent
vasodilation responses to Lp299v is a focus of in Aim 2. In Aim 3, we will test whether Lp299v
supplementation reduces pro-inflammatory signaling in human mononuclear cells known to contribute to
atherosclerosis formation and disease activity and whether FFAR3 activity is involved in this effect. The
application employs an innovative mix of translational investigations. We combine a randomized clinical trial to
study sex- and BMI-specific effects of Lp299v on vascular function using brachial artery ultrasound with critical
molecular and pharmacological studies targeting FFAR3 expression and activity in intact human vessels and
mononuclear cells. Additionally, we will employ innovative plasma-induced transcription studies and pathway
analyses to determine the impact of supplementation on whole genome transcription in human mononuclear
cells [lymphocytes (T-cell, B-cell, and NK cells) and monocytes] to determine how Lp299v impacts key
regulatory pathways involved in human vascular inflammation, atheroma formation, and plaque stability.","Recent human studies report an emerging, novel relationship between the gut microbiome and its metabolites
with the development of heart attacks and strokes. This application seeks to determine whether supplementation
with L. plantatum 299v can improve blood vessel function and reduce inflammation in both men and women as
well as obese and non-obese individuals and additionally determine if the favorable effects of L. plantarum 299v
are mediated through a novel receptor (FFAR3). Our findings would support the potential L. plantatum 299v to
improve cardiovascular health in humans.",

Heart failure (HF) expenditure amounts to several billion per year. Despite advances in medical treatment of
HF, mortality after HF onset and rate of recurrent HF decompensation remain high, underscoring an urgent
need to identify effective prevention strategies. Observational studies showed a higher risk of death in HF
patients with lower levels of vitamin D and two recent post-hoc analyses of trials conducted in mostly post-
menopausal women reported a reduction in HF rates in the vitamin D group compared with placebo. Vitamin D
has also been reported to improve hemodynamics and left ventricular remodeling in 229 HF patients. However,
no randomized trial has examined the effects of vitamin D on primary prevention of HF or on the rate of
recurrent HF decompensation in men and women. Efficacy of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and
docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on cardiovascular events has been reported in trials with low prevalence of stain
use only. EPA/DHA can reduce risk factors for HF including myocardial infarction, hypertension, and diabetes.
While some but not all observational studies have suggested an inverse association between EPA/DHA and
the incidence of HF, no large primary prevention trial of EPA/DHA on HF has been conducted. In addition,
effect modification of the effects of EPA/DHA on HF by statin has not been elucidated. This project will
investigate the effects of vitamin D and EPA/DHA supplements on the incidence rate of HF and on recurrent
HF decompensation in an ancillary study of the VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL), an NIH-funded

Abundant preclinical and epidemiologic data suggest that vitamin D possesses anti-neoplastic activity, and that
individuals with higher plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels have lower risk of colorectal cancer
(CRC) and improved survival from CRC. Despite compelling evidence implicating vitamin D in CRC, critical
questions remain about whether these findings reflect a true causal relationship, and what the biological mech-
anisms of vitamin D activity are. Our central hypothesis is that vitamin D supplementation to achieve sufficient
levels of 25(OH)D leads to improved survival in CRC patients and influences several neoplastic pathways that
can be exploited as biomarkers of efficacy and targets for novel treatment strategies. We will test this hypothe-
sis within two novel randomized clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation: a) a phase II double-blind random-
ized trial of high- versus low-dose vitamin D3 in combination with chemotherapy in patients with metastatic
CRC, and b) a randomized trial of preoperative high-dose vitamin D3 versus placebo in patients with
resectable colon cancer for examination of vitamin D biology in fresh human tumor tissue. We will also lever-
age a rich prospective cohort of metastatic CRC patients enrolled in a completed NCI-sponsored phase III trial
of chemotherapy (CALGB/SWOG 80405) to further define and validate biomarkers of vitamin D action. In Aim
1, we will determine the impact of supplemental vitamin D on survival of CRC patients, test distinct hypotheses
about the vitamin D dose-response relationship, and explore biomarkers of vitamin D status, response, and
efficacy. We will investigate whether circulating levels of vitamin D binding protein and tumoral expression of
vitamin D receptor, 1α-hydroxylase, and 24-hydroxylase are associated with improved survival within our ran-
domized trials, and whether these markers modify the relationship between vitamin D and patient outcome. In
Aim 2, we will conduct a precision medicine analysis of vitamin D to elucidate the mechanistic basis for its anti-
tumor activity in CRC. We will explore the impact of vitamin D supplementation on tumoral markers of inflam-
mation, lymphocytic infiltrates, and inflammatory gene signatures in surgical colectomy specimens from pa-
tients treated with high-dose preoperative vitamin D3 versus placebo. We will also perform next generation se-
quencing and Nanostring analysis of tumors from CRC patients with high- versus low vitamin D status to identi-
fy unique genetic and transcriptional signatures associated with vitamin D-mediated carcinogenesis. In sum-
mary, this translational proposal leverages innovative randomized trials of vitamin D to take the next critical
steps in understanding vitamin D activity and biology in CRC. Our findings will confirm causality, provide new
insights into biomarkers of vitamin D activity, and lead to potential inclusion of vitamin D into standard therapy
– including immunotherapy – with the ultimate goal of improving the survival of patients with CRC.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
The proposed research is relevant to public health because colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of
cancer death in the U.S., and may plausibly be linked to vitamin D deficiency. Abundant preclinical and epide-
miologic data link lower levels of vitamin D to increased risk of and mortality from colorectal cancer; this is par-
ticularly relevant given increasing rates of vitamin D deficiency in the U.S., as well as profound racial disparities
in vitamin D status and colorectal cancer incidence and mortality. In an era of expensive and often toxic anti-
neoplastic drugs, vitamin D therefore represents an attractive and accessible treatment option for patients of all
races and sociodemographic groups with respect to both safety and cost.",

 Overactive bladder (OAB), the presence of urgency, frequency, and nocturia, is common with aging, as is
urgency urinary incontinence (UUI). These are among the most bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms –
associated with worse mental health, poor physical well-being, and increased falls, fractures, and nursing
home placement. Despite treatment options, many patients do not become symptom-free and discontinue
medications due to side effects or perceived inefficacy. Attention is shifting to possible prevention and early
treatment strategies. Potential benefits of vitamin D may extend to several relevant organ systems, and vitamin
D could act via multiple pathways to reduce lower urinary tract symptoms by improving detrusor activity and
decreasing inflammation. Indeed, evidence emerging from epidemiologic studies indicate that higher vitamin D
levels are associated with decreased risk for OAB and UI.
 In this revision application, we will leverage two large, complementary epidemiologic studies – the VITamin D
and omegA-3 TriaL (VITAL, n=25,000 women and men) and the observational Nurses’ Health Studies
(n>100,000 women) -- to conduct a rich exploration of vitamin D and OAB, as well as UUI. In this revision, we
extend research to both OAB and UUI, increasing clinical relevance by broadening the outcomes (previously
only UI) while focusing on symptoms related to detrusor contractility. We also improve innovation by targeting
research in: (1) African Americans (n=2300 in NHS, n=5200 in VITAL), who disproportionately suffer from OAB
and UUI, and have higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency; and in (2) obese adults (n=34,000 in NHS,
n=7200 in VITAL), who are at higher risk of OAB and UUI, and have lower bioavailability of vitamin D as it is
retained in adipose tissue. Our main Aims are to: 1) assess if vitamin D3 supplementation decreases OAB and
UUI in VITAL, where participants have been assigned to 2000IU/day of vitamin D or placebo for five years, and
in NHS, where observational data are available on a large range of doses, from <400 IU to >800 and >1000
IU/day; and 2) to prospectively assess if higher plasma 25(OH)D levels at baseline are related to a decreased
incidence and progression of UUI in the NHS. In VITAL, where an estimated 50% of participants had
25(OH)D<30ng/mL at baseline, we propose to collect data on OAB and UI symptoms at year 5 by adding new
questions on urgency, frequency, nocturia and urine leakage at the close of the trial. The NHS already includes
extensive UUI data, and we will newly measure baseline vitamin D levels from stored blood samples and add
OAB questions in upcoming follow-up periods. The large samples of African American and of obese adults in
these cohorts uniquely enable important and novel research. The expected outcomes will be to provide
exciting new knowledge regarding vitamin D as a possible convenient, low-cost intervention for
preventing OAB and UUI symptoms and progression among women and men, specifically targeting
high-risk subgroups of African Americans and obese adults.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Overactive bladder (OAB) can occur with or without urgency urinary incontinence (UUI). OAB and UUI affects
the lives of millions of men and women and is very costly. Emerging evidence from epidemiologic studies link
higher vitamin D levels with lower rates of OAB and UUI. With this proposal, our goal is to understand the
relationship of vitamin D supplementation compared to placebo on OAB and UUI symptoms, especially in high-
risk subgroups. We will also evaluate how supplementation may improve new-onset OAB and UUI over time.",

There are high prevalences of osteoporotic fractures and vitamin D deficiency in the U.S., especially among
older adults. Although vitamin D supplements are widely used to improve bone health, evidence for a role of
supplemental vitamin D alone in reducing fractures is lacking. While the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]
level is considered the best analyte to assess vitamin D status, currently there is no consensus on the optimal
circulating total 25(OH)D concentration for bone. While, like many hormones, vitamin D circulates bound to
proteins, the relative importance of free 25(OH)D (FVD) or bioavailable 25(OH)D levels on fracture risk is not
known. New advances in technology make it possible to directly measure the biologically active, FVD level.
Results from recent observational studies on whether FVD and/or bioavailable 25(OH)D are more strongly
associated than total 25(OH)D levels with calcium homeostasis and bone mineral density (BMD) are
inconsistent. In addition, there are no data from large, randomized controlled trials on whether bioavailable
25(OH)D and/or FVD vs. total 25(OH)D levels or gene variations in vitamin D-related pathways modify effects
of supplemental vitamin D on fractures and changes in BMD. To fill gaps in knowledge, we propose an
ancillary study to the large, NIH-sponsored, randomized, controlled VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL)
that is testing effects of supplemental vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol, 2000 IU/d), and/or omega-3 fatty acids (fish
oil, 1 g/d) in the primary prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease in 25,874 U.S. men (aged ≥50) and
women (aged ≥55), including 5,107 African Americans. The proposed ancillary study will definitively determine
whether supplemental, high-dose, vitamin D3 alone reduces incident total, non-vertebral and hip fractures by
extending adjudication of fractures to the full 5 years of treatment in 25,874 VITAL participants nationwide. The
proposed studies will also rigorously test whether concentrations of bioavailable 25(OH)D and/or FVD are
more strongly associated with changes in BMD and incident fractures than total 25(OH)D levels; and whether
these vitamin D biomarkers and genetic variants in vitamin D-related pathways modify effects of supplemental
vitamin D on BMD and fracture risk. For each of the proposed aims, we will assess whether results vary by (a)
sex, (b) race/ethnicity, and (c) BMI. Key VITAL resources will be leveraged at no additional cost to the
proposed studies including: blood samples and BMD measurements (at baseline and follow-up), extensive
data on changes in 25(OH)D levels over time (in the treatment vs. placebo arms), measures of calcium
homeostasis, information on clinical risk factors, and extracted DNA. This proposal provides a unique and cost-
efficient opportunity to generate important positive or informative negative results about effects of supplemental
vitamin D3 alone on fracture risk, while also elucidating the relative importance of vitamin D biomarkers and
genetic variations in vitamin D-related pathways on bone. Findings from the proposed ancillary study have the
potential for major clinical as well as public health impact for both men and women in the U.S.","NARRATIVE
Vitamin D supplements are widely promoted for bone health, but definitive data on benefits and risks of high-
dose, supplemental vitamin D on fracture prevention are lacking. Results from this proposed ancillary study to

levels on fracture outcomes and bone density; evaluate gene variants that may modify effects of supplemental
vitamin D on bone health measures; and fill important gaps in knowledge on whether high dose, supplemental
vitamin D is safe and effective in the primary prevention of fractures in women and men across the U.S.",

These co-morbidities have been linked to heightened inflammation and monocyte activation, but the etiology of this heightened activation/inflammation is not fully understood, but is partly due to gut epithelial barrier dysfunction and microbial translocation. Attempts at controlling inflammation, immune activation or microbial translocation in HIV+ treated subjects have been for the most part unsuccessful, and even treatment that have been successful (such as statins) have drug interactions and safety concerns, likely precluding their use in a large proportion of the HIV population. Safer strategies that could be more widely adopted are well needed. It has been estimated by the WHO that nearly two billion subjects may be zinc deficient in the developing countries. In the developed countries, prior to effective ART, zinc deficiency was prevalent in HIV-infected subjects, and had been independently linked to disease progression and to higher mortality. Unlike what is observed with most nutrients, the prevalence of zinc deficiency continues to be high, even in subjects on ART. For example, the Nutrition for Healthy Living study found that 38% of subjects on ART had zinc deficiency, and subjects in the upper quartiles of zinc levels had lower HIV-1 RNA levels than those in the lowest quartile. Thus far, there is a lack of data related to the contribution of zinc status to the heightened inflammation and monocyte activation in HIV. Also, the few available zinc-supplementation studies in HIV have been mostly in untreated or not optimally treated subjects, and no studies have assessed changes in inflammation markers after zinc supplementation in HIV+ subjects with virologic suppression on ART, a pertinent population to the current era of HIV infection where guidelines are calling for every HIV+ subject to be aggressively treated. In the R21 phase of the proposal, we will assess the prevalence of zinc deficiency in HIV-infected subjects on ART and compare it to that of a matched group of HIV negative controls. We will also study the relationships between zinc levels and systemic inflammation, innate immunity and gut epithelial barrier dysfunction. Lastly, we will conduct a pilot study testing two different doses of zinc supplementation in HIV-infected subjects on ART with documented zinc deficiency. This pilot trial will also explore whether this strategy may affect selected inflammation markers and will help guide the next phase of investigations. In the R33 phase, we will conduct a pilot randomized placebo-controlled study of zinc supplementation in HIV-infected subjects on ART with zinc deficiency, and we will assess whether zinc supplementation is safe and effective at increasing zinc levels, and whether it will affect different pathways involved in HIV-comorbidities, namely innate immunity, systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and gut epithelial barrier dysfunction. Our proposal should provide important mechanistic insights to inform us on the mechanism of action through which zinc may produce clinical benefit in the HIV+ population, and as such will provide the information necessary to develop a competitive full-scale clinical trial.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Despite the advent of safer HIV therapies, several comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes are more common in people living with HIV, and have been linked to heightened inflammation state. Zinc deficiency (or low zinc levels) has been associated with abnormal state of heightened inflammation and with altered gut barrier in the general population. Little is known about the frequency and consequences of zinc deficiency in people living with HIV despite the fact that this population is known to have high inflammation and abnormal gut barrier. We will measure zinc levels in a group of HIV positive individuals and a group of HIV negative controls, and we will explore whether zinc deficiency is associated with high inflammation and abnormal gut barrier in these groups. In addition, we will conduct a novel pilot trial to study the effect of zinc supplementatio to modulate inflammation and repair abnormal gut barrier. The results of this study should inform public health efforts to ameliorate the risk of comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease not only in HIV-infected subjects, but also in other conditions where inflammation is enhanced, such as rheumatoid arthritis.",

With partnering Native American communities, the UNM Metals Exposure and Toxicity Assessment on Tribal 
Lands in the Southwest (UNM METALS) team has obtained evidence for community level exposures and 
health risks associated with more than 1100 abandoned uranium mine (AUM) waste sites on their tribal lands. 
This project will address underlying mechanisms to account for immune dysregulation, including early 
molecular markers of autoimmunity, associated with proximity to AUM and uranium and mixed metal exposure. 
Biomonitoring results confirm that community members are exposed to uranium and other metals beyond 
national norms. Our published and preliminary work shows that certain metals interact with key cellular targets 
to disrupt zinc-dependent protein function. We will test the hypothesis that metals disrupt multiple classes of 
zinc binding proteins known to regulate immune responses, and that supplemental zinc will mitigate 
immunotoxicity resulting from metal exposures. In Aim 1 aim we will investigate whether serum zinc sufficiency 
modifies immune dysregulation in individuals exposed to environmental metals by performing a cross-sectional 
analysis of archived population samples for associations between markers of immune function with metal and 
zinc levels present in blood and urine samples. Aim 2 will test the immunotoxic effects and underlying 
mechanisms of U, As and environmentally relevant metal mixtures defined by the Environmental Projects, and 
whether the immunotoxic effects are reduced by supplemental zinc in cell and mouse models. Aim 3 will test 
whether dietary zinc supplementation will decrease biomarkers of immune dysregulation in exposed 
populations in partnership with exposed communities. The work is innovative by combining exposure 
information and biomonitoring data from exposed populations with mechanistic studies in experimental models. 
To date, there are no significant, community-based health studies describing both exposure and immunologic 
outcome measures in these impacted Tribal communities. We propose a novel hypothesis that metals 
exposures disrupt multiple classes of Zn binding proteins critical for immune function leading to immune 
dysregulation and that supplemental Zn will mitigate metal toxicity. This study represents the first human 
intervention based on zinc supplementation to ameliorate the adverse effects of mixed metal exposures. To 
achieve the research goals, BP1 is well integrated with the Environmental Projects to inform distinct metals 
exposures, BP2 to share mechanistic data and model systems, the Community Engagement and Research 
Translation Cores for community input and reporting results back to the communities, and the Biostatistics and 
Data Management Core for research support. The outcomes from these studies will be significant by testing 
metals and metals mixtures of concern to communities to elucidate impact on and mechanisms of immune 
dysregulation as detected in exposed populations, and test the feasibility of a mechanism-based intervention to 
alleviate the adverse effects of metals exposures.","Project 3 – BioProject 1 (BP1) - Project Narrative 
This project addresses health effects associated with exposure to uranium and other metals found in legacy 
uranium mining waste sites in three Native American communities. The studies will also test the potential of 
dietary zinc to decrease susceptibility of exposed populations to metals-associated dysregulation of immune 
function.",

There is mounting evidence that low vitamin D blood levels are associated with increased risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). There are several mechanisms by which low vitamin D status may promote AD
pathology, including reduced β-amyloid (Aβ) clearance, dysregulation of calcium influx and glutamate-
mediated neurotoxicity. Vitamin D interacts with receptors in the hippocampus and many other brain regions,
and has established antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Recent neuroimaging studies have found that
low vitamin D levels are associated with increased periventricular white matter disease, reduced white matter
volume and larger ventricles. Vitamin D deficiency may also have a toxic effect on brain function independent
of Aβ metabolism. Preliminary studies of serum vitamin D levels in a diverse multi-ethnic cohort (n=382) of the
UC Davis Alzheimer's Disease Center found a high prevalence of low vitamin D status (61% with levels <20
ng/ml), which was associated with faster rates of decline on executive function and episodic memory.
This Phase II randomized clinical trial aims to test if supplementation with high dose oral vitamin D will
successfully correct vitamin D insufficiency, compared to treatment with standard (RDA) dose vitamin D in a
diverse community-based elderly cohort. The effect of high-dose vs. standard-dose vitamin D on altering
cognitive trajectories will also be assessed and data will be expected to be used in designing a potential
definitive Phase III trial in elderly groups at risk for dementia. A total of 180 elderly persons with longitudinal
biomarkers, neuropsychological testing and brain MRI scans will be enrolled, with 152 (~50 with MCI, 50 with
mild AD and 50 with no cognitive impairment) expected to complete the 3½-year study. One-half of each
diagnostic group will be randomized to treatment with high-dose vitamin D3 (4,000 IU daily) or to standard
dose Vitamin D (600 IU capsule daily + ~200 IU dietary = ~800 IU total/day). Longitudinal MRI analyses will
provide an estimate of the treatment effect size on brain atrophy rate. Vitamin D receptor genotype
polymorphisms and their impact on response to oral supplementation will also be examined. If vitamin D
supplementation improves cognitive outcome, this could have a large impact on the public health, since low
vitamin D status is a common, readably treatable condition which may provide a novel window to prevent
dementia and AD. Furthermore, the higher prevalence of AD and dementia in African Americans and Latinos
could be partially attributable to vitamin D insufficiency.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

The parent study seeks to develop a better biomarker panel that can be used by clinicians to assess a person's choline status. It has become apparent to us during the pilot phase of our studies that assessing Cho pool size using isotope dilution needs to be complemented by another accepted measure against which we can validate our metabolomic biomarker panel. We believe that using magnetic resonance spectroscopy to measure in vivo pools of soluble choline metabolites in liver needs to be added to our studies if we are to validate the metabolomic biomarker panel that we develop so as to convince clinicians that our metabolomic biomarker panel reliably predicts choline status. Choline is an important dietary supplement and essential nutrient, but there are no good validated biomarkers for assessing choline nutritional status that can be practically applied in clinical or public health practice. Choline is a required nutrient with Adequate Intake (AI) and a Tolerable Upper Limit (UL) levels set by the U.S. Institute of Medicine's Food and Nutrition Board and a Recommended Daily Intake (RDI). Given the narrow range for healthy intake of choline, given the establishment of a RDI of choline to maintain health, given the 3-fold variation in dietary intake in the US, given the effects of common genetic variants on requirements for choline and because plasma choline concentrations do not adequately reflect status, we propose that a panel of laboratory tests be developed and validated that assess choline status in humans. We will identify the biomarkers that best correlate with measurements of choline pool size using isotope dilution. Healthy volunteers (n=50 males, 50 premenopausal females and 50 postmenopausal females), as outpatients, will consume meals containing 100% of the RDI of choline (550 mg) for 2 weeks, 50% (275 mg) of the RDI of choline for 2 weeks, and 25% (137.5 mg) of the RDI of choline for 2 weeks. The order of dietary periods is randomly assigned and subjects and staff are masked. All subjects will receive all diets while on study, with a minimum of 2 weeks of “washout” between diet periods where participants go back to their normal diet. On Day 12 of each diet period, fasted subjects will consume a 250 mg bolus of choline in the form of Cho chloride-(trimethyl-d9). Plasma and urine samples will be collected for metabolomic assays and isotope dilution estimation of choline pool size and we will perform transient elastography of liver to assess liver fat. Magnetic resonance will also be used for independent assessment of choline status and liver fat. These studies will be used to determine the optimal set of biomarkers to use in calculating a choline status score.","NARRATIVE Choline is an important and essential nutrient, but there are no good validated biomarkers for assessing choline nutritional status that can be practically applied in clinical or public health practice.

 Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common and devastating complication of critical
illness, and effective therapies to prevent ARDS are limited. Vitamin D metabolites have potent
immunomodulatory effects and attenuate acute organ injury in animal models. Randomized controlled trials
(RCTs) are ongoing to test whether vitamin D3 (vit D3) administration improves outcomes in critically ill patients
at risk of ARDS. However, due to the heterogeneous nature of critical illness, patient-specific factors likely play
a major role in determining response to vit D3. We will use a precision medicine approach to investigate the
clinical, genetic, and biochemical factors that determine response to vit D3 administration in critical illness.
 This proposal is an ancillary study to the NHLBI-funded Vitamin D to Improve Outcomes by Leveraging
Early Treatment (VIOLET) trial, an ongoing, multicenter RCT that is enrolling 3000 critically ill patients at high
risk of ARDS and death. Patients are randomly assigned to receive a single enteral dose of 540,000 I.U. of vit
D3 or placebo to test whether vit D3 reduces 90-day mortality and acute organ injury. VIOLET is archiving
plasma and DNA from all 3000 patients on day 0, and plasma on day 3 from the first 300 patients. We
propose to collect plasma on day 3 from an additional 500 patients (Aim 1) and to leverage existing samples
(Aims 2 and 3) to test the following hypotheses.
 In Aim 1 we will use paired plasma samples (n=400) from days 0 and 3 to investigate the clinical factors
that affect the pharmacokinetic response to vit D3 administration in critical illness. We will test whether greater
severity-of-illness (higher SOFA score), obesity, and acute or chronic liver or kidney disease attenuate
increases in plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25D) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D) levels from day 0 to 3 in
patients who receive vit D3. In Aim 2 we will investigate whether pre-specified common polymorphisms in
genes affecting vitamin D metabolism or in vitamin D target genes identify a patient population more likely to
benefit from vit D3 administration, assessed by 90-day mortality (primary endpoint) and acute organ injury
(secondary endpoint). In Aim 3, we will investigate whether lower plasma levels of fibroblast growth factor-23,
an osteocyte-derived hormone that inhibits the conversion of 25D to 1,25D, identify a patient population more
likely to benefit from vit D3 administration, assessed by 90-day mortality (primary endpoint) and acute organ
injury (secondary endpoint).
 Development of a precision medicine approach to vit D3 administration in critical illness could have
immediate and actionable clinical impact by helping to inform both clinical decision making and the design of
future trials of vitamin D metabolites in critical illness.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

Thiamine deficiency diseases, notably wet and dry beriberi, and Wernicke's encephalopathy, a severe neurological syndrome associated with thiamine deficiency, are associated with many diseases and conditions that result from under-nutrition and malabsorption of thiamine (e.g. alcoholism, bariatric surgery) or hyper-metabolic states (e.g., cancer). However mechanistic studies following a recent and disastrous clinical drug trial (that was terminated because the drug, fedratinib, led to Wernicke's encephalopathy) highlighted the importance of pharmaceutical agents as contributors to thiamine deficiency. That is, fedratinib was shown to be a potent inhibitor of thiamine absorption via the thiamine transporter, SLC19A3. In this research application, we bring together NIH and USDA nutrition supported researchers, in response to PAR-15-024. In particular, we propose to test the hypotheses that commonly used medications inhibit SLC19A3-mediated intestinal absorption of thiamine resulting in drug-vitamin interactions. Secondly, we propose that these drug-thiamine interactions produce a detectable metabolic signature that relates to reduction in the activity of enzymes that are dependent on thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), the active metabolite of thiamine. Our hypotheses are based on exciting preliminary studies in our laboratories demonstrating that several prescription drugs, e.g., metformin, pyrimethamine and amiloride, are inhibitors of SLC19A3. Three aims are proposed: 1. Develop and characterize a humanized transgenic mouse model of SLC19A3 that can serve as an animal model to test drugs for their potential to cause thiamine deficiency. 2. Determine the effects of metformin on the pharmacokinetics and metabolic signatures of thiamine in healthy volunteers using a randomized crossover study; and 3. Use a novel miniaturized assay to screen a 2000-compound library of prescription drugs and bioactives to identify compounds that inhibit SLC19A3 and determine the key structural moieties for SLC19A3 inhibition using quantitative structure activity relationship modeling (QSAR). A multi-tiered approach will be used for the proposed studies including drug-vitamin interaction studies in healthy volunteers; metabolomic methods to identify metabolic signatures of thiamine; small molecule screening to identify inhibitors of SLC19A3; and creation and characterization of humanized mouse models of SLC19A3. Collectively, these novel studies will lead to a new knowledge of drug-vitamin interactions and their metabolic signatures. Specifically, the studies will lead to new tools that can be used in nutrient research and to a recognition that therapeutic drugs may adversely affect thiamine absorption and contribute to thiamine deficiency.","Poor nutrition and many diseases are associated with low levels of vitamin B1 (thiamine), which in turn causes health problems such as delirium and tremors. In this research, we will determine whether therapeutic medications contribute to low levels of thiamine by preventing its absorption in the stomach and intestine.

The ultimate goal of this research is to develop a means to safely administer iron supplements to infants in
settings with a high infection burden. The hypothesis underlying this project is that promoting development of a
beneficial, protective gut microbiota by co-administration of prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) and iron-
sequestering bovine lactoferrin (bLF) during iron supplementation will prevent iron-induced increases of
opportunistic enteropathogens that cause infection and inflammation. The proposed research will extend our
established strategy of conjoining investigations in vivo with intestinal fermentation and cellular models in vitro.
We will conduct a randomized clinical trial in 6 month-old Kenyan infants in conjunction with mechanistic
microbiota studies using our established long-term continuous polyfermenter platform inoculated with
immobilized fecal microbiota from Kenyan infants. The period from about 6 months to 1 year of age is vital both
for iron nutrition and for the establishment of a healthy gut microbiome that promotes immune system
development, local immune homeostasis and limits pathogen colonization. Oral iron supplements are
associated with a significant 15% increase in the rate of diarrhea in children in malaria-endemic areas. Our
most recent studies have shown that prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) can provide partial amelioration
of the adverse effects of iron-induced dysbiosis by enhancing the growth of barrier populations of bifidobacteria
and lactobacilli. We hypothesize that the combination of prebiotic GOS with bovine lactoferrin (bLF), adding
iron sequestration, antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities, will provide virtually complete protection
against the adverse effects of added iron on the intestinal microbiota. Our research has two specific aims:
 (1) to conduct a randomized, controlled double-blind 9-month clinical trial in 6-month old Kenyan infants
 comparing the effects on gut microbiome composition among groups receiving in-home fortification
 for 6 months with micronutrient powders containing 5 mg iron (as sodium iron EDTA [2.5 mg] and
 ferrous fumarate [2.5 mg]) and (i) galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS; 7.5 g), (ii) bovine lactoferrin (bLF, 1.0
 g), (iii) GOS (7.5 g) and bLF (1.0 g), and (iv) no GOS or bLF. Each infant will then be followed for an
 additional 3 months to determine the longer-term effects of the treatments.
 (2) to examine mechanisms of prebiotic GOS and iron-sequestering bLF on microbiota composition,
 enteropathogen development, microbiota functions and metabolic activity, and inflammatory potential

Prenatal vitamin and micronutrient supplementation is standard-of-care for pregnant women worldwide;
however, with the exception of a few ingredients, most prenatal supplementation guidelines are not yet
supported by substantial prospective clinical research. Recently, prenatal supplements with added lutein and
zeaxanthin have entered the American market with the stated intentions of enhancing infant visual and neural
development. Although clinical trials were never performed to support this contention, it is physiologically
plausible from the neonate's perspective because these dietary carotenoids are selectively concentrated in
human ocular and neural tissue in utero, especially during the third trimester of pregnancy, and there is
increasing evidence that lutein and zeaxanthin not only protect against macular degeneration in the elderly, but
they may also function to enhance contrast sensitivity, decrease glare disability, and increase visual acuity and
cognition throughout life. The macular carotenoid pigment is detectable at birth, and levels increase with age
at a time when they can contribute to visual function and foveal development. From the mother's perspective,
the last trimester of pregnancy is a time when she must transfer some of her carotenoid stores to the
developing infant, potentially putting her at risk for depletion systemically and in her ocular tissues.
Because of the importance to the long-term health of both mothers and their infants, a randomized, controlled
study using state-of-the-art quantitative assessment tools is indicated; however, before embarking on a
potentially very large multi-center clinical trial, it is appropriate to conduct a smaller-scale pilot study to explore
the feasibility of recruitment and retention and to develop the information to properly power future studies.
Currently, all available data on the role of carotenoids in prenatal health are cross-sectional or observational,
The proposed study is designed to test the hypotheses that: [a] the third trimester of pregnancy is indeed a
period of maternal systemic and ocular carotenoid depletion; [b] prenatal supplementation with commercially
available prenatal supplements containing lutein and zeaxanthin will counteract this reduction; [c] the
enhanced maternal carotenoid status associated with prenatal carotenoid supplementation will increase
systemic carotenoid levels and macular pigment in their newborn infants.
This R21 study will provide necessary preliminary data to design and power future, larger-scale prospective
clinical trials with further optimized formulations to determine whether prenatal and postnatal carotenoid
supplementation can have beneficial effects on maternal visual function and on infant visual and cognitive
development in normal and high-risk pregnancies. The results may also provide evidence-based support to
guide policy decisions about prenatal nutritional recommendations to enhance maternal and infant carotenoid
status, especially in regions of the world at risk for malnutrition.","Project Narrative

Asthma continues to represent a major global public health problem resulting in significant disability and
resource utilization. Most asthma is diagnosed before the age of six years and is preceded by episodes of
troublesome lung symptoms – wheezing, in the years after birth. Asthma is a complex disease with both
genetic and environmental exposures contributing to its development: ORMDL3 and FADS are well-replicated
asthma genes while vitamin D2-5 and n-3 polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs)6 have recently been identified as
important prenatal risk factors for asthma. Despite the identification of these risk factors, a complete
mechanistic understanding of how these exposures and genes operate together to impact asthma
development remains unknown. Metabolomic profiling has the distinct advantage of being a marker that
reflects the cumulative sum of past and current environmental and genetic exposures leading to the disease.
Our preliminary metabolomics work has successfully identified associations between prenatal exposures
(Vitamin D, n-3 PUFAs), asthma genes (ORMDL3 and FADS), and metabolites, thereby providing a direct
mechanistic connection of how these risk variants may operate together to influence disease development.
The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that the sphingolipid and eicosanoid pathways are important in
asthma pathogenesis and may enlighten the mechanisms through which asthma genes (e.g. ORMDL3, FADS)
and prenatal early life exposures (vitamin D and n-3 PUFAs) operate to cause or prevent asthma. For this
proposal, we will capitalize on two randomized clinical trials with analogous study design and follow-up
strategies – Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART) and Copenhagen Studies on Asthma in
Childhood (COPSAC2010). Together these studies showed that prenatal vitamin D and n-3 PUFAs in
supplementation reduce the risk of persistent wheeze/asthma in the first 3 years of life by 23% (p<0.01) and
32%6 (p=0.035) respectively. In this proposal we will: 1) Assess the effect of the maternal metabolome and
prenatal exposures on the child metabolome; 2) Study the relationship between metabolites in the sphingolipid
pathway, the ORMDL3 risk variant, and prenatal vitamin D supplementation on asthma risk; 3) Study the
relationship between pro- and anti-inflammatory eicosanoids, genetic variants in FADS, and prenatal n-3 PUFA
supplementation on asthma risk. Findings from this important study will have great public health importance in
elucidating mechanisms involved in the development of asthma in children and could lead to preventive
strategies against asthma in childhood.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Being the most common health-related cause of lost school and work days, asthma has a large public health
impact. We study potential mechanisms for asthma development in two biological pathways where we believe

will use 1,218 mother/child pairs from two randomized controlled trial birth cohorts that have data rich in
prenatal exposures, clinical measures, metabolomics, and genetics.",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): My long-term goal is to become an independent researcher in cardiovascular epidemiology with a focus on the morbidity burden associated with cerebrovascular diseases, particularly stroke. I will use this Mentored Career Development award (K01) to fulfill a series of training objectives which build upon my prior skills, but also expand my expertise in ways which are essential to accomplishing my long-term goal. These include: learning to measure and analyze longitudinal stroke outcomes data; developing skills to assess, characterize, and measure white matter hyperintensity volume (WMHV) and cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans; learning about the design, conduct, and analysis of randomized clinical trials; and acquiring skills in mediation analysis techniques. To achieve my training objectives, I have assembled a comprehensive and complementary mentorship team which has worked together and with me for many years. My training objectives will also allow me to develop the skills needed to establish new datasets within ongoing studies during this award period. These subcohorts are necessary to achieve the research goals of the K01 and will provide preliminary data for future grant applications for independent research funding.  I will apply my training to several important research questions during this K01 award. Recently, there has been growing interest in the role that vitamin D as well as omega-3 fatty acids play in the development of cardiovascular disease events. Given the high morbidity burden of stroke, determining the effect of these supplements on stroke outcomes is very important. The NIH sponsored VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) is an ongoing randomized, double blind trial testing vitamin D3 and omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in the primary prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease. I will leverage this ongoing trial and collect additional data on stroke outcomes that would not otherwise be collected by the parent study. In addition, there is growing interest in discovering risk factors fr overall subclinical cerebrovascular disease burden in the brain as measured by WMHV and CMBs. Because WMHV and CMBs are associated with stroke outcomes, understanding risk factors associated with WMHV and CMBs in ischemic stroke patients may identify strategies to reduce the morbidity burden of stroke. I will collect MRI scans performed as part of routine medical care in participants with an ischemic stroke to create a database of WMHV and CMBs in VITAL and the Women's Healthy Study (WHS), a completed trial of the effects of low dose aspirin and vitamin E in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer with ongoing observational follow-up. By using data from both VITAL and WHS, I will have the unique opportunity to study how a wide variety of cardiovascular disease risk factors impact WMHV and CMBs in stroke patients. The training, mentorship, research experience, and opportunity to establish new subcohorts provided by this K01 award will allow me to achieve my long-term career goal of becoming an independent research in cardiovascular disease epidemiology.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal will examine the impact of vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids supplements on stroke outcomes in initially healthy populations. Additionally, I will examine whether a wide variety of cardiovascular disease risk factors, including vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid supplements, are associated with overall cerebrovascular disease burden in the brains of participants with ischemic stroke.",

 Autoimmune diseases affect ~ 5% of the U.S. population and carry a high burden of morbidity, health care
costs, disability, and premature mortality. In the first cycle of this award, we leveraged an innovative nationwide
NIH-funded double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial, VITAL, to test the effects of vitamin D (vitamin
D3 [cholecalciferol]) and marine omega-3 fatty acid (eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] + docosahexaenoic acid
[DHA]) supplements upon the risk of incident autoimmune disease and changes in biomarkers of systemic
inflammation. Data from laboratory studies, observational epidemiologic research, and small prevention trials
strongly suggest that these nutritional agents have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating benefits. Popular
enthusiasm for vitamin D and fish oil supplements underscores the urgent need for rigorous testing. We have
recruited, randomized, and are following 25,874 VITAL participants, men aged ≥50 and women aged ≥55
nationwide, including 20% African Americans. Following a 3 month run-in, eligible participants were randomly
assigned to one of four treatment groups: vitamin D3 (2000 IU/d) and fish oil (EPA+DHA, 1 g/d); vitamin D3 and
fish oil placebo; placebo vitamin D3 and fish oil; and placebo vitamin D3 and placebo fish oil. At yearly intervals,
all participants receive a new pill supply, are asked about compliance and side effects, and report incident
autoimmune diseases. A physician endpoints committee has confirmed 444 incident autoimmune disease
cases by medical record review to date. In a randomly selected subcohort of 1634 VITAL participants, blood
samples have been assayed for changes in C-reactive peptide, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-
receptor 2 in all four trial arms. With this renewal grant, we will complete the 5 pre-specified years and a 2 year
observational extension, critically important given the long latency of autoimmune disease onset. Continued
follow-up will improve statistical power for detecting preventive effects on autoimmune disease incidence, and
will enable investigations of effects over time and effect modification by baseline factors and biomarkers. We
hypothesize that there will be a delayed reduction in autoimmune disease, and that the largest preventive
effects will be among those with high systemic inflammation, including the obese and those with elevated
baseline biomarkers of inflammation. In this renewal, we also will test for changes in “Specialized Pro-
Resolving Mediators” (SPM), novel omega-3 fatty acid-dependent lipids responsible for inflammation

 Autoimmune diseases affect ~ 5% of the U.S. population and carry a high burden of
morbidity, health care costs, disability, and premature mortality. The purported health benefits of
vitamin D and marine omega-3 fatty acids for preventing autoimmune diseases and decreasing
systemic inflammation receive enormous attention in the medical literature and popular press,
but definitive data supporting the beneficial effects of these two readily available over-the-
counter agents are lacking. This nationwide double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized
clinical trial will conclusively test the potential benefits of vitamin D and marine omega-3 fatty
acid supplements for the prevention of autoimmune diseases, investigating the time course of
their effects and subgroups most affected, as well as the potential generation of novel lipid
mediators that can promote inflammation resolution.",

Septic shock is a common and highly morbid clinical syndrome that affects over 200,000 patients in the United
States annually and results in over 40,000 deaths. Kidney failure is a frequent complication of sepsis and
septic shock that is associated with worse outcomes. To date, the understanding of kidney injury in sepsis and
septic shock has traditionally focused on decreased blood pressure leading to kidney hypoperfusion. Recent
studies have challenged this paradigm, however, illustrating that sepsis associated kidney injury often occurs
even when perfusion is adequate. These findings suggest that alternative pathophysiologic mechanisms may
have a role in sepsis related kidney injury. The mechanisms remain poorly understood and as yet there are no
proven interventions aimed at mitigating sepsis-induced kidney injury.
Thiamine (vitamin B1), a key cofactor of pyruvate dehydrogenase, is a critical component of oxidative
phosphorylation (i.e. aerobic mitochondrial respiration). In the absence of thiamine, mitochondrial metabolism
shifts towards anaerobic energy production, which is inefficient and results in lactate production. Thiamine
deficiency has also been linked to increased levels of reactive oxygen species. Our research group has
previously demonstrated that thiamine deficiency is common in critical illness and inversely associated with
lactate levels. We hypothesize that thiamine deficiency during critical illness may occur due to increased
metabolic demand which rapidly consumes available thiamine stores.
In a randomized trial, our research group has found that the administration of thiamine to thiamine deficient
patients with septic shock leads to reduced lactate at 24-hours. In a post-hoc analysis of that study, my work
has shown that patients (including both thiamine replete and thiamine deficient patients) who received thiamine
had lower creatinine values at 24-hours and were less likely to require kidney replacement therapy (e.g.
dialysis). Our research group has also shown improved cellular oxygen consumption in septic patients and
cardiac surgery patients who receive thiamine.
Given the above, we hypothesize that thiamine attenuates kidney injury during septic shock by supporting
aerobic mitochondrial metabolism. To test this hypothesis, we have planned a randomized, double-blind
placebo-controlled trial of thiamine to improve in kidney function in patients with septic shock. This award will
allow me to further develop as a physician-investigator and to test important hypotheses with potentially
significant therapeutic benefits for patients with sepsis and septic shock.","Project Narrative
Septic shock is a common and highly lethal condition. Our research group has previously found evidence that
thiamine, a B vitamin, may prevent kidney injury during septic shock. To test this hypothesis, we propose a

Risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) is significantly elevated in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD);
however, this increased risk is only partially explained by traditional CV risk factors. Arterial dysfunction is an
important nontraditional CV risk factor gaining increased recognition in the field of nephrology. While many
changes likely contribute to the development of arterial dysfunction in patients with CKD, among those of
greatest concern is the development of stiffening of the large elastic arteries. This process is best represented,
both physiologically and pathophysiologically, by increases in the gold standard measure of arterial stiffening,
carotid to femoral artery pulse wave velocity (CFPWV), which reflects, in particular, increases in aortic
stiffness. Aortic stiffening with CKD is mediated by structural and functional (increased vascular smooth
muscle tone) changes in the arterial wall stimulated by oxidative stress and chronic low-grade
inflammation. Caloric restriction (CR) is a promising strategy for prevention of CKD-associated arterial
dysfunction and CVD. In this context, we have shown that CR reduces CFPWV and SBP in older mice and in
overweight/obese middle-age and older adults. However, long-term adherence to chronic CR regimens with
optimal nutrition is very difficult to achieve and unlikely to become clinically relevant in the near future as it may
reduce muscle and bone mass. As a result, we have since shown that boosting NAD+ bioavailability to
stimulate SIRT-1, a “CR mimetic” approach, reduces CFPW and oxidative stress in old mice, and we recently
took the first step in translating these findings in a study of middle-age and older adults with normal kidney
function and elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP). We found that supplementation with nicotinamide
riboside, a natural, commercially available precursor of NAD+ and novel CR mimetic, was well tolerated and
increased NAD+ bioavailability and reduced CFPWV and SBP. Here we propose a randomized, placebo-
controlled, double-blind, single-site phase IIa clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of oral
nicotinamide riboside (500 mg capsules 2x/day; NIAGEN®; ChromaDex Inc.) for 3 months vs. placebo
(n=59/group) for decreasing aortic stiffness and SBP in men and women (35-80 years) with stage III and IV
CKD. We hypothesize that treatment will be safe and well-tolerated, and will reduce CFPWV and SBP, as
related to increases in systemic NAD+ bioavailability and reductions in oxidative stress, inflammation and
vasoconstrictor factors.
Aim 1: To measure CFPWV (primary outcome) before/after nicotinamide riboside vs. placebo treatment;
Aim 2: To measure casual and 24h-ambulatory SBP (secondary outcome) before and after treatment;
Aim 3: To determine the safety and tolerability of treatment with nicotinamide riboside vs. placebo;
Aim 4: To measure systemic NAD+ and NAD+–related metabolite concentrations, as well as circulating
markers of oxidative stress, inflammation, and vasoconstriction factors before and after treatment.","Project Narrative
The proposed research will determine the effectiveness of nicotinamide riboside, a natural supplement and
novel alternative approach to mimic the effects of sustained calorie restriction (i.e., “dieting”) for improving the
health and function of arteries in adults with moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease. The research also
will study the effects on clinic and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure and will provide insight into how
nicotinamide riboside improves artery health by assessing novel physiological mechanisms (biological
reasons) involved. Overall, the proposed research will provide important new scientific evidence on the
effectiveness of mimicking calorie restriction for reducing risk of cardiovascular disease in people with chronic

With increased interest in patient-centered outcomes research and precision medicine, investigation of
heterogeneity of treatment effect (HTE) in clinical trials has emerged as a key area of study. HTE is an
assessment of the degree to which the impact of an intervention varies between subgroups. Evidence from trials
of selenium supplementation indicates that this is a critical area for investigation of HTE. To date, three major
clinical trials of the trace element selenium (Se) as a chemopreventive agent have been completed. First, in the
Nutritional Prevention of Cancer (NPC) trial, participants were supplemented with 200 µg of Se per day or
matching placebo, and a statistically significant 58% reduction in colorectal cancer incidence among participants
randomized to receive the selenium supplement was observed. Next, the results of the Selenium and Vitamin E
Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) were published. The largest trial to date of Se for cancer prevention,
SELECT demonstrated no reduction in risk of colorectal cancer among men supplemented with 200 µg/d of Se
as L-selenomethionine. We have recently completed the Selenium Trial, which was the third major clinical trial
of Se for chemoprevention. This was a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in
which 1535 participants received 200 µg/d of Se as selenized yeast or placebo to ascertain whether Se
supplementation reduced the risk of colorectal adenoma recurrence. No differences in overall colorectal
adenoma recurrence by intervention group were detected; however, subgroup analyses revealed the presence
of heterogeneity of treatment effect (HTE). Among participants who had an advanced adenoma at baseline,
there was a statistically significant reduction in adenoma recurrence for those randomized to Se as compared to
placebo. However, there was also a statistically significant increase in the incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D)
among older participants (>63 years) receiving selenium. These results identify a major research gap regarding
the need for identification of individual characteristics that may contribute to HTE and thus determine whether
Se supplementation elicits a beneficial or harmful effect. This is a particularly timely question given that
approximately half of American adults report using dietary supplements. We propose herein to investigate
several factors that may affect individual outcomes related to Se supplementation, including 1) Genetic
background; 2) Intake and blood concentrations of fat-soluble antioxidants; and 3) Oxylipin profiles in response
to Se supplementation. In summary, we contend that the in vivo efficacy and toxicity of Se in a given individual
may be influenced by genetic background, interactions with antioxidants, and oxylipin metabolomic profiles. The
findings of this study will have a direct impact on public health recommendations by identifying individual
characteristics that may elicit either beneficial or harmful health effects of Se supplementation.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
The proposed work has the potential to make major contributions to public health recommendations
regarding the potential benefits and harms of selenium supplements. We have designed three separate but
complementary aims that will elucidate factors that elicit individual differential responses to selenium
supplementation using genetic analysis, consideration of fat-soluble antioxidant interactions, and targeted
oxylipin profiling.",

Despite the profound public health burden, there have been no clinical trials that have attempted to directly address the neurodevelopmental deficits that are so debilitating in FASD. Extensive pre- clinical work (Thomas et al. and others) has provided evidence that choline supplementation is effective in attenuating the neurodevelopmental deficits caused by prenatal alcohol exposure in animal models. Our group has taken the initial steps toward translating this work to humans with two randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled trials. We first conducted a pilot study to ensure the feasibility, tolerability, and safety of choline supplementation in 20 children with FASD (Fuglestad et al, 2013). Next, we completed a study of 40 additional participants with the goals of establishing a target dosage for young children, testing efficacy in the domain of memory, and determining a developmental window for choline's effects (detailed in `preliminary studies').  Briefly, our pilot data revealed that: 1. Children wih FASD consume insufficient dietary choline on average; 2. Choline supplementation was safe, tolerable and feasible for 2-5 year olds; 3. Supplementation for 9 months increased children's explicit memory performance relative to placebo; 4. Significant memory improvement was seen in 2-3 year olds but not 4-5 year olds. For 2-3 year olds, memory improvement was 21 percentage points in the choline arm compared to 2 percentage points in the placebo arm; 5. A dose ranging from 10-19 mg/kg was associated with the largest improvement in memory; 6. A very common single- nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs12325817), related to endogenous choline production, appears to moderate the efficacy of choline for children with FASD.  These findings directly inform the next study. Aim 1 involves evaluating a 19 mg/kg dose in 60 children with FASD, ages 2 to 5. This dosing scheme will optimize the neurocognitive benefits and further enhance tolerability of the intervention. In addition to continuing the evaluation of memory benefits from choline, Aim 2 adds measures of attention and executive function as possible additional targets. The NIH Toolbox Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test and the Executive Function Scale for Early Childhood (pilot-tested during our last study) have been added. Aim 3 adds a longitudinal component - it will evaluate 40 children in the period two years after treatment to determine the permanency of choline's effects. Lastly, Aim 4 will further examine the role of known SNPs in choline synthesis as moderators to the observed treatment effects.  In summary, the proposed study will continue the translation of choline's application - from experimental pre-clinical work to an evidence-based intervention for neurodevelopmental deficits in children with FASD.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is known to contribute to permanent brain damage in the child, yet there are no established treatments. We completed the first two studies of choline supplementation in human children: a feasibility study and a pilot efficacy study. The proposed study will continue that work, determining whether choline supplementation during a specific developmental window when the child's brain remains somewhat plastic is able to attenuate the deficits in thinking, memory, processing speed, and behavior that are common in children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and whether these changes are long- lasting.",

impairment (MCI) and progresses to Alzheimer's disease, underlying mechanisms are poorly understood, and
interventions limited. Published evidence links MCI to elevated oxidative stress caused by increased levels of
reactive oxygen species (ROS). To defend against the damaging potential of ROS (which causes oxidative
stress, OxS), cells normally depend on antioxidants, and Glutathione (GSH) is the main component of human
endogenous intracellular antioxidant defenses. GSH is a tripeptide composed of three amino-acids, cysteine,
glycine and glutamic acid. Since elderly humans are known to have an increased risk of developing elevated
OxS and GSH deficiency, we investigated and reported that intracellular GSH deficiency in elderly humans
occurs primarily due to intracellular deficiency of two of its precursor amino-acids cysteine and glycine, but not
glutamic acid, and that these GSH-deficient elderly humans had elevated ROS levels indicating elevated OxS.
Supplementing cysteine (as n-acetylcysteine) plus glycine orally as capsules for 2-weeks replenished their own
intracellular concentrations, improved intracellular GSH synthesis, restored intracellular GSH levels and
lowered ROS/OxS to levels seen in younger humans. GSH is also a key component of mitochondrial
antioxidant defenses, and GSH depletion induces mitochondrial dysfunction with elevated ROS levels,
neuronal injury and apoptosis. We studied and reported that mitochondrial dysfunction and OxS in aging
(elderly humans and aged mice) can be improved by correcting GSH deficiency. These findings have
implications for MCI in elderly humans. In a small ongoing open-label pilot study investigating the long-term
safety and impact of supplementing cysteine and glycine on mitochondrial function, OxS and cognitive
function (NCT02348762), we found significant improvements in memory, language and executive
function at 4w, 12w and 24w after starting cysteine plus glycine supplementation, and these
benefits appear to recede 12w after stopping these supplements. These preliminary data support the
exciting possibility that cysteine plus glycine supplementation in elderly humans could improve MCI by
improving GSH concentrations, mitochondrial function, and/or improving vascular/endothelial function, and
by lowering OxS. The goals of this pilot trial are to (a) establish the relationship in older humans between
MCI, GSH deficiency, impaired mitochondrial fuel oxidation and elevated OxS, and (b) determine proof-of-
concept of whether supplementing cysteine plus glycine to correct these defects improves MCI in aging.","Elderly humans have an increased risk of dementia which begins as mild defects in memory called mild
cognitive impairment – we do not know why this happens and there is no effective treatment. Our group found
that supplementing the diets of such elderly humans with protein building blocks called cysteine and glycine
improves their cognitive function, and when these supplements are stopped the benefits begin to decline. This
exploratory study will find out if this effect is real and identify factors responsible for cognitive impairment
(and improvement) by studying a bigger group of elderly humans with mild cognitive impairment who will be
evaluated 12 weeks after receiving either cysteine plus glycine or a placebo protein, and a further 12-weeks
after stopping these supplement proteins.",

Patients undergoing surgery to treat their bladder cancer face very high rates of complications and mortality.
The radical cystectomy operation is fraught with the highest complication rates of all urologic oncology
surgeries performed and is also extremely catabolic. As the National Cancer Institute has identified in its
provocative questions 2 & 11, variations in immune function and nutritional interventions affect the
response to cancer treatment. Radical cystectomy will continue to save lives, but there is a high cost in terms
of persistent surgical complications. The long-term goal of this project is to unlock the potential of nutrition
interventions to improve outcomes, survival, and quality of life in cancer patients. The objective of this project
is to determine the impact of a specialized form of nutritional support on surgical outcomes and to better
understand the mechanisms by which it acts. The hypothesis is that perioperative use of a specialized form of
nutritional support will have greater efficacy than a standard form of nutritional support to reduce post-
operative complications. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of published preliminary data
produced in the applicants' laboratories and expert guidelines calling for more rigorous study of this
approach. The rationale is that Specialized IMmunonutrition (SIM) is fortified with nutrients (L-arginine,
omega-3 fatty acids, dietary nucleotides, and vitamin A) that have immediate effects on immune and
inflammatory responses, muscle sparing, and wound healing after surgery. Guided by strong preliminary
data, the hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: 1) To determine the impact of perioperative SIM
versus an identical Oral Nutrition Support (ONS) lacking the immuno-modulators on post-operative
complications from RC; 2) To compare the impact of SIM to ONS on secondary clinical outcomes after RC
surgery; 3) To evaluate the impact of consuming SIM compared to ONS for restraining myeloid-derived
suppressor cells (MDSCs), decreasing inflammation, and modulating nutrient metabolism. The project is
significant because it offers a high yield, low-risk, low-cost strategy to improve the outcome of patients with
bladder cancer who undergo RC. Our innovative approach could transform clinical practice to reduce post-
operative complications, thereby diminishing the burden of bladder cancer surgery and has the added
potential to help many other surgical patients beyond cystectomy.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

Advancing age is associated with numerous changes in gastrointestinal physiology and function which can influence the
amount and type of nutrients delivered to the small intestine and colon. These changes, along with altered immune
function, can affect the composition and function of the gut microbiota. However, the role of these changes on the
impaired glucose homeostasis observed with aging is unknown. Interestingly, gut microbiota-generated trimethylamine
N-oxide (TMAO), a metabolite of bacterial choline metabolism, increases with advancing age in both mice and humans
and the latter is believed to be a consequence of age-related gut dysbiosis. Indeed, there is an increase in the
abundance of trimethylamine-producing bacteria with aging. The overall objective of this R21 proposal is to establish
proof-of-concept for a greater impairment in glucose homeostasis following increases in gut microbiota-generated TMAO
in older compared with young adults in order to conduct a larger, more comprehensive and mechanistic trial in the future.
To this end, following a two-week lead-in controlled diet, 20 healthy young adults (18-34 yrs) and 20 healthy older (65-
79 yrs) adults will complete a 4-week randomized crossover trial of both choline bitartrate (1000 mg/d) or placebo. A 2-
week washout period with continued controlled feeding will separate the treatments. All subjects will be fed an isocaloric
diet (50% carbohydrate, 35% fat,15% protein) controlled for fiber and micronutrient content for the duration of the study
to avoid the potential confound of individual differences in diet on gut microbiota. Measurements of insulin sensitivity
and beta cell function via IVGTT, glucose tolerance via mixed meal tolerance test, and 24-hr glycemic control using
continuous glucose monitoring, TMAO concentration by UPLC-MS/MS, inflammatory cytokines via ELISA, and gut
microbiota composition/function using 16S rRNA pyrosequencing and targeted qt-PCR, respectively will be made before
and following each 4-week treatment period. The findings from this integrative physiological study have significant
translational potential as they may advance basic science findings in rodents to humans and provide novel mechanistic
insight into observational studies in humans by establishing a specific role of the gut microbiome in modulating insulin
sensitivity and 24-hr glycemic control with aging. In turn, the gut microbiota may be a key target for therapies that

irritability. Our group is planning to test if at two different doses of a probiotic (defined as a
bacterial product which when consumed in adequate quantity improves health) can benefit
these children with GI symptoms. Oral doses of the probiotic we have selected (Lactobacillus
rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium lactis BB-12, BB-12+LGG) to be tested are: a straw with 2
billion colony forming units (CFUs), a straw with 10 billion CFUs, and a placebo straw. We plan
to enroll 70 eligible subjects with confirmed ASD and randomize them to placebo, low dose, and
high dose of BB-12+LGG once daily at 1:2:2 ratio. The probiotic, to be added to food, may
improve abdominal complaints which we hypothesize may produce changes in autistic behaviors
that accompany these GI symptoms.
Even though probiotics are widely available, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires
that we demonstrate that this particular combination probiotic is safe in children before we can
undertake a large multi-center trial to see if BB-12+LGG is effective at different doses in
children with ASD. Based on previous trials in adults and adolescents, we expect no serious side
effects from the use of BB-12+LGG. There will be 4 visits over 90 days. We expect to see a trend
toward improvement of autistic behavior and GI symptoms by the end of the 56 days of
treatment with BB-12+LGG at the highest dose. The pain and abnormal behaviors will be
recorded using validated questionnaires.
This study incorporates an Integrated Omics approach. Several blood and stool tests will be
tested as potentially useful biomarkers of intestinal health in ASD, including a test of gut
permeability (zonulin), a blood test for systemic inflammation (S100A9), and a stool test for
inflammation (calprotectin). We will concomitantly measure bacterial communities in the stool
(using 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing) and we will measure key metabolites in the blood and
stool that have been proposed to contribute to GI symptoms in children with ASD (using high

Based on a large body of evidence, vitamin D has emerged as a potential determinant of type 2 diabetes
(t2DM) risk. In longitudinal observational studies, higher vitamin D status was associated with up to 83%
reduction in the risk of t2DM. However, the evidence to support vitamin D supplementation for prevention of
t2DM remains inconclusive. The favorable association between vitamin D status and t2DM risk in observational
studies may be confounded by a variety of factors, and long-term, well-designed and adequately powered trials
are lacking.
The “Vitamin D and type 2 diabetes” (D2d) study is being funded by NIH to provide definitive conclusions
regarding the role of vitamin D supplementation for prevention of t2DM. D2d is an ongoing, multicenter,
randomized (1:1), double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, primary prevention clinical trial with two
groups (oral 4,000 IU/day of vitamin D3 vs. placebo) among participants at risk for diabetes who are followed
for incident diabetes. D2d is designed as an event-driven trial. The study met its enrollment goal in December
2016 and 98% of enrolled participants continue in D2d after a mean follow-up of 19 months. Adherence to
study pills is very high (>92% of pills prescribed). The primary aim of the renewal grant is to continue follow-
up of the D2d population (N=2,423) and complete the study according to the protocol, which has been
approved by the DSMB and all participating IRBs, to answer the study’s primary question: does oral daily
vitamin D3 supplementation lower risk of incident diabetes among U.S. adults at high risk for diabetes?
Secondary Aims will assess: the heterogeneity of treatment effect of vitamin D supplementation on incident
diabetes in subgroups defined by key baseline characteristics (e.g., blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration),
effects on secondary outcomes (e.g., blood pressure), and the long-term safety and tolerability of 4000 IU/day
of vitamin D3 supplementation. Finally, data from the D2d placebo group will define the natural history of pre-
diabetes using the new American Diabetes Association diagnostic criteria that include hemoglobin A1c.
The need for a trial such as the D2d study has been recognized in multiple editorials and reviews, including the
2011 Institute of Medicine report on dietary reference intakes for vitamin D, which identified diabetes as one of
the most promising non-skeletal outcomes with an urgent need for rigorously conducted trials to confirm the
promising results seen in observational and mechanistic studies.","Project Narrative
Relevance of the project to public health: The D2d study addresses an important question and has the
potential for significant impact in the clinically important area of type 2 diabetes mellitus prevention. If the trial
confirms a favorable benefit/harm ratio of vitamin D supplementation in modifying diabetes risk, vitamin D
would be integrated into contemporary strategies as an inexpensive and readily available preventive approach
for the more than 86 million Americans at risk of type 2 diabetes and help to ameliorate the high personal and
societal burden of the disease. D2d also represents a unique opportunity to examine the effect of vitamin D3
on non-diabetes outcomes (e.g., blood pressure, CVD risk) and inform on the long-term safety and tolerability
of the dose of 4000 IU/day, which is the upper limit for toxicity by the Institute of Medicine. Finally, D2d will fill
an important knowledge gap regarding the natural history of pre-diabetes using the new American Diabetes
Association diagnostic criteria that include Hemoglobin A1c.",

dramatically worldwide. It is estimated that obesity is second only to smoking as a cause of premature
preventable death. This is largely due to the comorbidities associated with obesity including metabolic syndrome,
diabetes, cardiovascular disease and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Yet, very little progress has been made in
the development of treatments to prevent obesity and its comorbidities, and the mechanistic link between obesity
and development of comorbidities is not completely understood. Several studies have shown that obese rodents
develop tissue vitamin A deficiency, with tissue retinoid concentrations decreasing by a stunning 75-90%,
suggesting profound metabolic dysregulation. Findings in cell systems and animal models demonstrate that
retinoids regulate adipocyte differentiation and glucose and lipid metabolism and, further, that decreased retinoid
concentrations are associated with progressive obesity, insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. Thus,
aggregate preclinical data suggest that altered vitamin A metabolism may contribute directly to obesity
progression and the development of obesity-related co-morbidities. Critically, the mechanisms underlying this
dysregulated vitamin A metabolism remain poorly understood, and the relevance of these preclinical findings to
human obesity is unclear. A central premise of this proposal is that altered vitamin A metabolism in obesity is a
result of increased inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6 and TNF in metabolic tissues, which regulate the
expression of the retinoid metabolizing enzymes CYP26, LRAT, ALDH1A and RDH in adipocytes and various
liver cell types. We further hypothesize that this dysregulation of vitamin A metabolism occurs in human obesity
as well as in animal models. We will test our hypotheses in two specific aims: 1) to identify the enzymes and the
key regulatory signals that control all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) concentrations and vitamin A metabolic flux in
human liver and adipose tissue, and 2) to establish whether adipose tissue and liver vitamin A metabolomes are
altered in obese humans. We will use our state-of-the-art mass spectrometry methods, innovative metabolic flux
experiments and kinetic modeling in specific cell types to characterize the key enzymes that metabolize retinoids
in liver and adipose tissue and determine how the activity of these enzymes is altered in obesity. To determine
whether tissue retinoids are altered in human obesity, we will conduct a cross sectional clinical study comparing
visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue, liver and serum vitamin A metabolomes in obese and non-obese
subjects. The proposed studies will lay the foundation for understanding the regulation of vitamin A metabolism
in human liver and adipose tissue and for determing how vitamin A metabolism may become dysregulated in
obesity contributing to progressive obesity and its co-morbidities in humans. The results will generate
unprecedented insight into human retinoid biology and ultimately could lead to targeted therapeutic interventions
designed to restore tissue retinoid signaling as a novel strategy for the treatment of obesity and its sequela.","The obesity epidemic is a major public health burden and incurs annual healthcare costs in excess of $150
million in the U.S. alone. Rodent models suggest that obesity is associated with significant tissue vitamin A
deficiency which, in turn, contributes to progressive obesity and development of obesity-associated co-
morbidities. This project will help define the mechanisms regulating tissue-specific vitamin A metabolism in
humans, determine the relevance of preclinical findings to human obesity, and establish whether tissue retinoids
may be potential novel treatment targets for obesity and its associated co-morbidities.",

The purpose of this K01 career development award submission is to support a period of didactic training and

increase her ability to carry out studies of cancer survivorship and to become an independent cancer
researcher. Dr. Bethea’s long-term goal is to carry out studies that will result in a better understanding of
factors that influence cancer survivorship and that will lead, ultimately, to higher survival among Black women
affected by breast cancer and reduced cancer health disparities. She has already had training in environmental
health and cancer epidemiology. Through the K01 training, she will develop expertise in cancer survivorship,
statistical analyses of survival data, and molecular epidemiology, under the mentorship of a distinguished
panel of researchers – Drs. Julie Palmer, Christine Ambrosone, Nancy Keating, Michael LaValley, and Edward
Ruiz-Narváez. The mortality rate from breast cancer, the most commonly occurring cancer among women in
the U.S., is 42% higher in Black women than White women. Dr. Bethea’s research will address an
understudied topic, modifiable factors related to breast cancer survivorship in Black women. To this end, her
proposed research utilizes data from the Black Women’s Health Study (BWHS), a longitudinal study of 59,000
African American women. During follow-up, more than 2,300 incident invasive breast cancer cases have
occurred and they will be the subject of Dr. Bethea’s research. Dr. Bethea will assess several modifiable risk
factors – post-diagnosis use of aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and post-
diagnosis use of vitamin D supplements and of predicted plasma vitamin D levels – in relation to breast cancer
recurrence and breast cancer-specific mortality among breast cancer cases in the BWHS. She will create
genetic risk scores using data on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from candidate genes and will
assess whether the associations of aspirin/other NSAIDs or of vitamin D supplementation and predicted
plasma vitamin D levels with breast cancer recurrence and breast cancer-specific mortality are modified by
genetic risk scores. Thus, Dr. Bethea will create a specific area of research in which she is highly proficient. As
an independent researcher, it is anticipated that she will lead further BWHS research on cancer survivorship,
which could be stand-alone studies or collaborative studies with other investigators. Dr. Bethea is an
outstanding candidate. A K01 career development award will enable her to conduct important research as an

to promotion. Importantly, it will also provide valuable information on factors related to breast cancer survival in
Black women.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

grow exponentially. It is currently estimated that 33.5 million people worldwide are afflicted with AF. Once
established, AF is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, much of which is not impacted by current
treatment options. In this competing continuation of the VITAL Rhythm Study, we propose to continue our
evaluation of the balance of benefits and risks of marine omega-3 fatty acid (840 mg eicosapentaenoic acid
[EPA] + docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) and vitamin D3 (2,000 IU/day cholecalciferol) on AF incidence in the
setting of an NIH-funded large-scale clinical trial, the VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL). VITAL is an
ongoing, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2x2 factorial trial specifically designed to evaluate the
efficacy of vitamin D3 and marine omega-3 fatty acid supplements in the primary prevention of cancer and
cardiovascular disease among 25,874 men (aged 50+ years) and women (aged 55+ years). Benefits and risks
with respect to incident AF have been postulated for both of these commonly used supplements based on
results from observational studies and short-term secondary prevention randomized trials, but definitive data
from a large-scale primary prevention randomized trial are lacking. In this competing continuation, we propose
to continue our ancillary study that is in the process of ascertaining and adjudicating AF outcomes within the
VITAL trial to test whether long-term treatment (5-years) with omega-3 fatty acid and/or vitamin D3
supplementation has an impact on the incidence AF over 7-years of follow-up in an older population. Case
validation of incident AF is ongoing and involves systematic ascertainment of physician diagnoses of AF on
annual study questionnaires supplemented by CMS linkage followed by collection of detailed diagnostic
information from medical records. The extended follow-up will allow us to fully ascertain and adjudicate the AF
endpoints occurring throughout the 5 year VITAL randomized trial and a 2-year post-intervention period and
determine whether these agents might have a selective impact on persistent versus paroxysmal forms of AF.
Since both agents are known to impact biologic processes involved in atrial structural and electrical
remodeling, long-term post-intervention benefits and/or selective benefits on persistent forms of AF are
plausible. The additional endpoints that will be adjudicated during the continuation along with the separately
funded measurements of plasma 25(OH)D and EPA+DHA assays in the VITAL trial will also allow us to
perform important sub-analyses according to sex and baseline nutrient level. In summary, we propose to build
on the infrastructure and processes created in the first funding cycle and continue to take advantage of the
enormous investment of resources and infrastructure in the VITAL trial to provide a definitive and full
assessment of the benefits and risks of these agents on AF incidence and persistence. If beneficial, then these
agents would represent the first therapy proven effective for AF prevention.","Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained heart rhythm disturbance and accounts for
approximately 15% of strokes and is associated with doubling of mortality. Once established,
atrial fibrillation is difficult to treat; and therefore, research directed at prevention of atrial
fibrillation is essential. Findings from this proposed study conducted within a large clinical trial
will clarify whether vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid supplementation reduces the long term risk
of developing AF and progression to more severe forms of AF, providing important data
applicable to public health and clinical guidelines for AF prevention.",

Osteoporosis is the most common bone disease; 53.6 million Americans have a reduced bone mass, which
increases their risk of fragility fractures. In addition to the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, recent
studies show that approximately 60% of older men and 40% of older women have inadequate vitamin K
intakes. Growing evidence indicates that there are important interrelationships between vitamin D and vitamin
K on bone. Vitamin D increases intestinal calcium absorption and stimulates production of two proteins,
osteocalcin and matrix Gla protein. Vitamin K plays an essential role in activating these proteins so that
osteocalcin incorporates calcium in bone and matrix Gla protein inhibits calcification in soft tissues, including
the kidney. Both vitamins D and K are important for optimal function of these proteins. Although vitamin D
supplements are widely used to improve bone health, trials of supplemental vitamin D alone in reducing
fractures showed inconsistent results. Emerging evidence indicates that supplemental D in the context of low
vitamin K status is less effective on bone health measures. Therefore, low vitamin K status may account for
some of the inconsistencies of trials testing vitamin D and bone health and may contribute to toxicities
attributed to high-dose vitamin D such as kidney stones. No previous randomized controlled trials have been
adequately powered to test effects of vitamin K status on fracture risk or the interaction of vitamin K status with
high-dose, supplemental vitamin D on bone. To fill knowledge gaps, we propose an innovative, ancillary study
to the large, NIH-sponsored, VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL). VITAL is testing effects of supplemental
vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol, 2000 IU/d), and/or omega-3 fatty acids (fish oil, 1 g/d) in the primary prevention of
cancer and cardiovascular disease in 25,871 U.S. men (aged ≥50) and women (aged ≥55), including 5,106
African Americans. In this competitive renewal application of “VITAL: Effects on Bone Structure and
Architecture,” we will determine whether low vitamin K status, assessed by 3 sensitive biomarkers, modifies
effects of supplemental vitamin D on fractures, bone mineral density (BMD) and structure, and secondarily on
increases in urine calcium excretion, a risk factor for low BMD and kidney stones. During the first cycle of this
grant, we surpassed recruitment goals and collected baseline and 2-yr post-randomization imaging studies for
bone density, structure and architecture that will be used in the proposed studies (n=771). In addition, other
key VITAL resources will be leveraged including: 16,953 baseline and 6,000 follow-up blood samples;
measures of vitamin D, calcium, creatinine and parathyroid hormone; and adjudicated fractures and kidney
stones. This proposal provides a unique opportunity to clarify in the largest study of supplemental vitamin D,
the interdependencies of vitamins D and K and their roles on fractures, bone health measures, and urine
calcium excretion. Findings from the proposed ancillary study will be critical to the interpretation of on-going
vitamin D trials and provide new insights to advance clinical care and public health recommendations.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Vitamin D supplements are widely promoted for bone health. Both vitamin D and vitamin K are important for
deposition of calcium in bone, but no study has assessed the role of vitamin K status on fracture outcomes in a
large randomized-controlled trial of high-dose, supplemental vitamin D. Results from this proposed ancillary
study to the large, VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) will fill gaps in knowledge and advance public
health guidelines on the interrelationship of vitamin D and vitamin K on bone health and fractures in women
and men across the U.S.",

Indolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas are incurable diseases, and require intermittent and often
morbid and expensive therapy during their prolonged natural history. Lower intensity and
better-tolerated, cost-effective treatment strategies are needed for these patients. Low vitamin
D levels at diagnosis of indolent lymphomas are strongly associated with inferior outcomes to
treatment. Standard therapy for low tumor burden, indolent lymphoma includes a single agent
monoclonal antibody (rituximab). In this proposal, we will complete a double-blind, placebo-
controlled randomized trial evaluating if vitamin D supplementation with 2000IU oral tablets daily
for three years improves the progression-free survival of patients with indolent lymphoma
treated with single agent rituximab. Stratification factors for randomization will include histology
and FL-IPI prognostic score. The primary endpoint of the trial is progression-free survival over
three years; secondary endpoints include response at 13 weeks, and overall survival. Planned
subset analyses include follicular lymphoma histology and female sex. With 210 randomized
patients, we will have 80% power to detect a HR = 0.55 at a two sided alpha = 0.05 level of
significance. This clinical trial will be coordinated at the University of Rochester Wilmot Cancer
Institute, and six expert lymphoma centers from the Lymphoma Epidemiology of Outcomes
(LEO) Consortium will participate. We will leverage this LEO consortium for tumor banking and
prospective patient-reported outcomes of enrolled patients. We will also identify if baseline
and/or restaging serum vitamin D levels predict subgroups of patients for whom Vitamin D
supplementation is particularly effective or particularly ineffective. Finally, since there is
evidence to suggest that response to oral vitamin D supplementation may be dependent upon
specific genotypes of the Vitamin D receptor (VDR) and vitamin D binding protein (DPB), we will
utilize whole exome sequencing to determine whether vitamin D-related germline variations are
critical determinants of outcome in the context of vitamin D supplementation of patients with
indolent lymphoma. Our aims the defining threshold levels of vitamin D where supplementation
is most effective and the impact of germline polymorphisms on outcome will inform future trial
designs and contribute to mechanistic understanding. Demonstrating a benefit to vitamin D
supplementation in this randomized trial would rapidly change standard of care in the most
common presentation of indolent lymphoma, and provide a low-risk, well-tolerated, inexpensive
option delaying the time to morbid treatments.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Several studies suggest Vitamin D deficiency is correlated with inferior outcome after treatment

Abstract 
 Alaska Native (AN) children experience high rates of early rickets and vitamin D deficiency compared with 
other US populations. Pregnant AN women from Alaska`s Yukon Kuskokwim (YK) Delta have increased 
rates of vitamin D deficiency associated with transition from a traditional marine diet. Alaska Native 
children from the YK Delta experience one of the highest reported rates of early childhood caries (ECC). A 
Canadian study showed an association between low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels in prenatal 
women and ECC in their infants. We evaluated the association between YK Delta prenatal 25(OH)D 
levels and ECC in their children using data from the 'Maternal Organics Monitoring (MOM) Study”, and 
children's electronic dental records to assess ECC by decayed missing and filled teeth (dmft) scores. In 
the analysis, children 24-35 months of age with cord blood 25(OH)D <12 ng/ml had a mean dmft score 2.4 
times higher than non-deficient” children (p=0.003). There is limited information on the impact of prenatal 
supplementation improving vitamin D concentrations in pregnant women and no information on the impact 
on ECC. With available evidence, it is unclear whether vitamin D supplementation should be prescribed as 
part of routine antenatal care. Therefore, the current American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists 
recommends only the 400 IU of vitamin D in prenatal vitamins. Data in YK Delta women from the MOM 
study (2000-2010) showed 91% of 25(OH)D cord blood levels were <20ng/ml (insufficient), and 53% were 
<12ng/ml (deficient). In Fall 2015, YK Delta Regional Hospital (YKDRH) evaluated 25(OH)D in prenatal 
women – 60% were insufficient (<20ng/ml). In Fall 2016 YKDRH implemented guidelines to add 1000 IU 
of daily vitamin D to routinely recommended prenatal vitamins (400 IU) and calcium (200 IU). The recent 
Vitamin D supplementation guidelines in YK Delta offers an opportunity to evaluate the impact of prenatal 
supplementation on 25(OH)D concentrations and ECC. We propose a cohort study using the electronic 
health records and dental records to evaluate: 1) the effectiveness of prenatal vitamin D supplementation 
in increasing 25(OH)D concentrations to sufficient levels, 2) the association between deficient prenatal 
(25(OH)D concentrations and ECC, and 3) the impact of prenatal vitamin D supplementation on ECC. We 
will test the difference in 25(OH)D levels at first prenatal visit and third trimester in women before and after 
enhanced vitamin D supplementation, and measure factors associated with compliance. We will evaluate 
mean dmft scores between non-deficient and deficient Vitamin D groups, and before and after 
supplementation. and explore the relationship of covariates. This Information will help clinicians make 
decisions about prenatal vitamin D supplementation in YK Delta and other high risk populations.","No data",

Despite prophylactic immune suppression, clinically significant (Grade II–IV) acute graft-versus-host disease
(aGvHD) afflicts up to 45% of pediatric patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation
(alloHCT). As aGvHD is responsible for nearly 20% of deaths following alloHCT, the need for better prevention
and therapy for aGvHD is readily apparent. Involvement of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract in the pathogenesis
of aGvHD has been substantiated by the translation of pre-clinical and clinical studies. Emerging evidence
suggests that perturbations in the microbiota diversity result in aberrant systemic immune response as well as
pathogen colonization and mucosal invasion, fostering the development of GvHD. Pre-clinical studies also
suggest that replenishing commensals like Lactobacillus prior to HCT substantially decrease GvHD severity
and intestinal insult. Our pilot data suggest that probiotics are safe to administer prior to and during children
and adolescents undergoing HCT (IND#108,977). This proposal is a double-blind, randomized, multi-center
intervention trial to evaluate the specific effect of probiotics in preventing GI aGvHD and more generally the
effects on overall GvHD severity. The proposal is an approved concept of Children’s Oncology Group’s (COG),
a NCI National Clinical Trial Network group. The study will be conducted through COG using its clinical
research infrastructure. Correlative laboratory studies (plasma and stool analysis) will be performed in order to
elucidate the mechanisms of action of probiotic therapy. The probiotic, Lactobacillus plantarum (LBP), or
placebo will be administered to 384 evaluable children and adolescents undergoing alloHCT for hematologic
malignancy beginning with the initiation of conditioning through Day 56. We hypothesize that maintaining
epithelial cell integrity through the administration of probiotic therapy will lead to restoring microbial diversity,
which will preserve immune tolerance and prevent aGvHD. The primary study aim is to determine efficacy of
orally-administered LBP in preventing the development of GI aGvHD in children and adolescents undergoing
alloHCT for the treatment of cancer. Secondary study aims are: (1) To determine whether orally-administered
LBP decreases the incidence of Grade II–IV aGvHD following alloHCT; (2) To determine whether LBP
administration maintains intestinal integrity as measured by mean plasma citrulline levels and reduction in
mucosal barrier injury (MBI) bacteremia; (3a) To measure the effects of LBP on the intestinal flora phylogenetic
composition during and after alloHCT using 16S rRNA gene deep sequencing; (3b) To measure effects of LBP
on intestinal flora function during and after alloHCT using metagenomic and metabolite profiling; and (4) To
measure proposed immunomodulatory effects of LBP in mean plasma levels of alloreactive-induced
inflammatory cytokines (IL-2, IL-6, IL-12p70, IFNγ, and TNFα) in patients receiving LBP compared to placebo.
The proposed study will be the first double-blind randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of
probiotics in preventing GI aGvHD in pediatric HCT. If a beneficial effect is observed, expansion of the
proposed intervention to other pediatric and adult malignant conditions requiring alloHCT may improve overall
quality of life and prevent transplant-related complications like aGvHD.","Project Narrative
The proposed study is a randomized, controlled intervention trial to determine the benefit of probiotic therapy in
preventing the development of gastrointestinal acute graft versus host disease in children undergoing
allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation for a hematologic malignancy. Importantly, correlative studies will
be performed to elucidate mechanisms of probiotic therapy on the microbiome. The discovery of a benefit of
probiotic therapy will have a significant impact on morbidity, mortality, and cost of care in both adults and
children undergoing HCT for treatment of cancer.",

The SWOG Statistical Center in Seattle, Washington, served as the coordinating center for two large prostate
cancer prevention trials: The Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) and the Prostate
Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT). SELECT was a Phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to
assess the effect of selenium and vitamin E, alone and in combination, primarily on prostate cancer incidence
and secondarily on other cancer incidence. SELECT randomized 35,533 men between 2001 and 2004. PCPT,
also a Phase III, double-blind trial, randomized 18,882 men to either finasteride or placebo between 1994 and
1997. Although schedules and requirements varied between the two studies, substantial serum, plasma, white
blood cells, and prostate tissue were collected on both, resulting in rich biorepositories.
Each had extensive prospective data collections which included diet and dietary supplements, quality of life,
physical activity, medications, other cancer diagnoses, cardiovascular endpoints, and treatment adverse events.
Although there have been significant scientific collaborations to date, there remain numerous opportunities to
further interrogate the clinical database and biobanks. Additionally, serum and plasma measures and extensive
genotyping data have already been obtained and are available for other investigators to use.
These cohorts are fully mature with 6,045 deaths and median follow-up of 18.4 years on PCPT and 3,762 deaths
and median follow-up of 10.1 years on SELECT. There have been 2,401 and 2,475 prostate cancers detected
during the trials plus an additional 890 and 338 prostate cancers identified via Medicare linkage in PCPT and
SELECT, respectively. Other primary cancers have also been documented either during the trials or through
data linkage. In addition to being able to extend the results of these well-conducted, randomized clinical trials
through linkages to Medicare, NDI and completed GWAS studies, these data can be used for epidemiologic
research as part of the ongoing consortium projects.
We request funds to continue to enrich the cohorts by collecting new data elements such as end point data from
Medicare and National Death Index linkages. We plan to update our linkages early in the upcoming grant period.
We also request support for the cohort team to develop detailed documentation and data sets to load into the
Cancer Epidemiology Data Repository, and we ask for continued support to provide a stable infrastructure for
the PCPT serum and PCPT and SELECT tissue repositories (all located at the University of Colorado). With
continued funding for the Statistical Center and some of our key scientific colleagues, we will be able to provide
administrative assistance and expertise to investigators who apply for additional funding to conduct studies using
our rich biologic repositories and clinical databases from PCPT and SELECT.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
By fully using the data and biologic samples from these two large cohorts with extensive follow-up, we will be
able to evaluate risk factors for prostate and other cancers, and subsequent prognosis. We will be able to
contribute clinical, demographic and biologic data, particularly genome wide measures, and we will provide
access to biologic specimens from men diagnosed with prostate and other cancers to researchers to better

cytokines and other circulating metabolites contributing to inflammation. Gut microbial composition and
function are amenable to modification by diet. Flaxseed (FS), a whole food commonly consumed as a dietary
adjuvant for several purported health effects, is a rich source of the polyphenolic lignans. Structurally similar to
endogenous estrogens, lignans have been most widely studied for phytoestrogen effects; however, anti-
inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antioxidant effects have also been reported, primarily in animal and cell
models. Importantly, to become physiologically available to humans, plant lignans require metabolism to
enterolignans by a consortium of gut microbial community members, but not all individuals are enterolactone
producers. Plant lignans are converted by the gut bacteria to the primary circulating enterolignan
enterolactone (ENL) which can be measured in most body fluids. ENL has been inversely associated with
several inflammation-related chronic diseases and, as a bacterial metabolite, has significant potential to impact
health. Using existing data and specimens from a completed flaxseed intervention study in healthy,
postmenopausal African American (AA) and non-Hispanic White (NHW) women that investigated the impact of
the intervention on gut microbial communities, lignan metabolism, and steroid hormone metabolism, we will
accomplish the following Aims: 1) In the overall study sample, determine associations between gut microbial
community profiles, circulating metabolic profiles, and circulating inflammation-related cytokines for women
who are high vs low ENL producers; 2) In a subset of women (n=80; 40 high producers [20 AA, 20 NHW], 40

metabolic pathways related to chronic low grade inflammation and these pathways will differ by producer
status and for AA and NHW women. The proposed study offers a unique opportunity to characterize changes
in microbial function and subsequent modification of circulating metabolic profiles related to chronic low grade

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Potent antiretroviral therapy has had an impressive impact on mortality in HIV-infected subjects, but this success came at the expense of significant co-morbidities, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. These co-morbidities have been linked to heightened inflammation and monocyte activation, but the etiology of this heightened activation/inflammation is not fully understood, but is partly due to gut epithelial barrier dysfunction and microbial translocation. Attempts at controlling inflammation, immune activation or microbial translocation in HIV+ treated subjects have been for the most part unsuccessful, and even treatment that have been successful (such as statins) have drug interactions and safety concerns, likely precluding their use in a large proportion of the HIV population. Safer strategies that could be more widely adopted are well needed. It has been estimated by the WHO that nearly two billion subjects may be zinc deficient in the developing countries. In the developed countries, prior to effective ART, zinc deficiency was prevalent in HIV-infected subjects, and had been independently linked to disease progression and to higher mortality. Unlike what is observed with most nutrients, the prevalence of zinc deficiency continues to be high, even in subjects on ART. For example, the Nutrition for Healthy Living study found that 38% of subjects on ART had zinc deficiency, and subjects in the upper quartiles of zinc levels had lower HIV-1 RNA levels than those in the lowest quartile. Thus far, there is a lack of data related to the contribution of zinc status to the heightened inflammation and monocyte activation in HIV. Also, the few available zinc-supplementation studies in HIV have been mostly in untreated or not optimally treated subjects, and no studies have assessed changes in inflammation markers after zinc supplementation in HIV+ subjects with virologic suppression on ART, a pertinent population to the current era of HIV infection where guidelines are calling for every HIV+ subject to be aggressively treated. In the R21 phase of the proposal, we will assess the prevalence of zinc deficiency in HIV-infected subjects on ART and compare it to that of a matched group of HIV negative controls. We will also study the relationships between zinc levels and systemic inflammation, innate immunity and gut epithelial barrier dysfunction. Lastly, we will conduct a pilot study testing two different doses of zinc supplementation in HIV-infected subjects on ART with documented zinc deficiency. This pilot trial will also explore whether this strategy may affect selected inflammation markers and will help guide the next phase of investigations. In the R33 phase, we will conduct a pilot randomized placebo-controlled study of zinc supplementation in HIV-infected subjects on ART with zinc deficiency, and we will assess whether zinc supplementation is safe and effective at increasing zinc levels, and whether it will affect different pathways involved in HIV-comorbidities, namely innate immunity, systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and gut epithelial barrier dysfunction. Our proposal should provide important mechanistic insights to inform us on the mechanism of action through which zinc may produce clinical benefit in the HIV+ population, and as such will provide the information necessary to develop a competitive full-scale clinical trial.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Despite the advent of safer HIV therapies, several comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes are more common in people living with HIV, and have been linked to heightened inflammation state. Zinc deficiency (or low zinc levels) has been associated with abnormal state of heightened inflammation and with altered gut barrier in the general population. Little is known about the frequency and consequences of zinc deficiency in people living with HIV despite the fact that this population is known to have high inflammation and abnormal gut barrier. We will measure zinc levels in a group of HIV positive individuals and a group of HIV negative controls, and we will explore whether zinc deficiency is associated with high inflammation and abnormal gut barrier in these groups. In addition, we will conduct a novel pilot trial to study the effect of zinc supplementatio to modulate inflammation and repair abnormal gut barrier. The results of this study should inform public health efforts to ameliorate the risk of comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease not only in HIV-infected subjects, but also in other conditions where inflammation is enhanced, such as rheumatoid arthritis.",

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) arises through T-cell mediated killing of the pancreatic beta-cells. It has a strong
genetic component, but environmental factors likely influence disease triggering as well as the post-onset
disease course. In human T1D families, we have identified an elevated inflammatory state that is consistent
with exposure to microbial antigens. In healthy siblings of probands, this familial innate inflammation is
supplanted by an age-dependent regulatory state that includes temporal increases in peripheral activated
regulatory T-cell frequencies. We have identified a similar inflammatory state in the BioBreeding DR rat model
of T1D. DR rats are not spontaneously diabetic, however T1D can be triggered in young animals by viral
infection. Importantly, the innate inflammatory state in DR rats is temporally supplanted by an IL-10/TGF-β-
mediated regulatory state that coincides with the inability of virus to induce T1D in older animals. In line with
studies that implicate an altered gastrointestinal microbiota in T1D pathogenesis, modulation of the microbiota
in healthy siblings of T1D probands or DR rats partially normalizes the underlying inflammatory state. In
BioBreeding rats, such treatments prevent development of T1D. Our studies suggest that T1D progression is
promoted when the genetically controlled but environmentally influenced familial innate state is augmented by
additional inflammatory signals prior to the establishment of robust counter-regulatory mechanisms. Our
studies have also focused on the persistence of insulin secretion after T1D onset, which is clinically significant
as even modest residual beta cell function is associated with reduced risk of complications. These studies
have utilized a plasma-based transcriptional bioassay that quantitatively captures inflammatory: regulatory
balance. Importantly, new onset T1D patients with short post-onset partial remissions, exhibit plasma based
signatures with predictively higher inflammatory bias, as well as reduced peripheral regulatory T-cell
abundances. In genetically susceptible healthy subjects and T1D patients, we hypothesize
that levels of immune activity are in part governed by composition of the microbiota and systemic microbial
antigen exposure. This in turn influences the rate of T1D progression as measured by duration of the post-
onset partial remission. With our large patient population and expertise, we are well-positioned to test the
hypothesis that the inflammatory state associated with T1D and T1D susceptibility can be partially normalized
through probiotic supplementation. We propose the following specific aims.
1. Determine whether Lactobacillus plantarum 299v supplement reduces systemic inflammation and
prolongs residual β-cell function in new onset T1D.
2. Define how L. plantarum 299v supplementation alters immune activity in new onset T1D.","Project Narrative

The focus of the Program is directed toward synthetic retinoids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and phytochemicals. However, the scope of the program and depth of expertise have been expanded by strategic recruitment and a mentoring program. Furthermore, transdisciplinary research is nurtured through focused working groups. This program is co- directed by Dr. Craig A. Elmets (Professor and Chair, Department of Dermatology and Director of the UAB Skin Diseases Research Center) and Dr. Clinton J. Grubbs (Professor, Department of Surgery and Director of the Chemoprevention Center). Currently, the program is comprised of 18 members from 10 departments and 5 schools. This program has $4,187,741 in annual direct cost funding, of which 76% is derived from the NCI. In addition to the traditional utilization of inter-programmatic teams and intra-programmatic collaborations, the capabilities of the program are greatly expanded by established extramural agreements: (1) Dr. Grubbs directs Task Order from the NCI PREVENT program which awards contracts to investigators both at UAB and other institutions, and (2) Dr. Elmets participates in an NCI-funded consortium of early phase human chemoprevention trials led by the University of Wisconsin. Over the past four years, the program has produced 206 publications, of which 35% % were intra-programmatic, 28%% were inter-programmatic, and 34% were inter-institutional. A vibrant communications component that includes a seminar series with lecturers from inside and outside the University supports collaborative research among program investigators. Major completed studies at UAB have moved chemopreventive agents from various classes (including rexinoids, cyclooxygenase inhibitors, and dietary polyphenols) to clinical trials during the last few years.","No data",

Significant Public Health efforts have been made towards salt reduction but most have met with failure. Dietary
factors such high sodium/low potassium diets contribute to the development of cardiovascular diseases
(CVDs) such as atherosclerosis and high blood pressure (BP). This is important as CVD is the number one
killer in the U.S. While the role of these two nutrients on BP is widely accepted, their impact on the vasculature
has received less attention. Endothelial dysfunction, characterized by impaired dilation, is an important non-
traditional risk factor for atherosclerosis. We have shown that high sodium diets cause endothelial dysfunction,
independent of changes in BP (accomplished by testing adults with salt resistant BP). Evidence supporting
potassium's beneficial role on vascular health remains unclear although it may be more effective in the
presence of a high sodium diet. A purported mechanism responsible for sodium-induced vascular dysfunction
is overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulting in reduced nitric oxide (NO)
production/bioavailability. It has been suggested that potassium can counteract sodium's effects by reducing
ROS. Additionally, high sodium diets have been shown to stiffen the endothelium by increasing abundance of
the endothelial sodium channel (EnNaC) while potassium's role on EnNaC is unknown. Our central hypothesis
is that dietary potassium will protect the vasculature from sodium's harmful effect by preserving NO and
reducing oxidative stress and endothelial cell stiffness. We will use three 10-day diets to test our hypothesis
(controlled feeding study, crossover design, diet order sequence randomized with washout between diets). We
will compare a moderate potassium/high sodium diet (MK/HS; 65 mmol/300 mmol) to a high potassium/high
sodium (HK/HS;120 mmol/300 mmol) to assess potassium's protective effect on the vasculature during a fixed
sodium intake. We will also compare a moderate potassium/low sodium (MK/LS; 65 mmol/50 mmol) diet to the
MK/HS diet to individually confirm salt resistant BP status. Focusing on salt resistant adults allows us to isolate
the vascular effects, without the confound of changes in BP (i.e., independent of BP). Rigor will be enhanced
by utilizing twenty-four hour ambulatory BP and urine collections during each diet condition; men, women, and
minorities will be tested. Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation will be used to assess conduit endothelial-
dependent dilation. Cutaneous vasodilation in response to local heating using laser Doppler flowmetry coupled
with intradermal microdialysis will be used to assess microvascular function. Venous endothelial cells will be
collected for direct assessment of cell stiffness by atomic force microscopy and markers of oxidative stress.
We expect to demonstrate that dietary potassium protects the endothelium from the deleterious effects of high

ABSTRACT
In the past 5 years, the Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) has increased cumulative enrollment
to over 2000 adult and pediatric patients in the ongoing Prospective and Retrospective registry studies.
In addition, an “Acute” DILI protocol with collection of serial early biological samples for mechanistic
biomarker studies was developed and implemented. Other network aims included investigation of the
role of genetic polymorphisms in DILI susceptibility and outcome, development of improved causality
assessment methods, and expansion of the LiverTox website. The University of Michigan team led by
Dr. Fontana has played an important role in the design, implementation, and analysis of the primary and
ancillary DILIN studies since its inception in 2003. Michigan has not only been a leading enroller in all of
the ongoing Registry studies but also provided important leadership in multiple DILIN committees and
initiatives. The Michigan team now proposes a series of novel and feasible study aims for the DILIN
renewal. The PRIMARY AIM of this proposal is to continue to recruit and enroll high causality adult and
pediatric DILI cases into the registry studies for genetic, immunologic, biomarker and mechanistic
studies. The Michigan Hepatotoxicity Network has specific plans to increase the enrollment of ethnic
minorities via the engagement of hepatologists/ collaborators in southeastern Michigan and elsewhere
that care for a large number of African American, Hispanic, and Asian patients. In addition, further
development of natural language processing algorithms to search the EMR at the University of Michigan
are proposed to facilitate enrollment. Qualitative, quantitative and toxicological studies of the chemical
constituents in the herbal and dietary supplement (HDS) products implicated in a growing proportion of
DILI cases will be expanded via an ongoing collaboration with the National Center for National Products
Research. The SECOND AIM of this proposal is to conduct pilot/ feasibility clinical trials to improve the
outcomes of patients with severe acute DILI and those at risk for developing chronic DILI. Proposed
study designs include a 12 week course of a simple and safe, orally administered anti-inflammatory or
anti-oxidant agent (e.g. budesonide, SAMe, vitamin E) in selected patients with severe acute DILI at risk
for adverse outcomes. In addition, 12 to 24 week studies of a safe and effective orally administered anti-
cholestatic agent such as an ileal apical bile salt transport inhibitor that may reduce serum bile acids are
proposed for subjects at risk of chronic DILI. Lastly, prospective studies of magnetic resonance
elastography and MRCP imaging are proposed to improve our understanding of the severity and natural
history of DILI. The THIRD AIM of this proposal is to further expand the LiverTox website to include
additional chapters on HDS DILI, develop and implement a computerized causality assessment
instrument, and assemble working committees to insure that the website content remains up to date and
pertinent. Finally, additional collaborations between DILIN and the US FDA and other regulatory
agencies are proposed to enhance the pharmacovigilance capabilities of DILIN for new causes of DILI
and temporal changes over time.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
The University of Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network proposes to improve our understanding of
the etiologies, risk factors, and outcomes of DILI via the continued enrollment of adult and pediatric
patients including targeted enrollment of ethnic minority patients that will help determine if there are racial
differences in DILI susceptibility and outcomes via analysis of collected biological samples, DNA, liver
tissue, and clinical data. Pilot/ feasibility clinical trials of simple, safe and mechanistically based
treatments for patients with severe acute DILI and those at risk for developing chronic DILI are also
proposed. Finally, further development and enhancement of the LiverTox website is proposed to
include additional chapters on HDS DILI, development and implementation of a computerized diagnostic
instrument, and expansion of the pharmacovigilance capabilities of DILIN.",

prevention of cataract and age-related macular degeneration (AMD), two leading causes of visual impairment
in US adults. Recent findings from the Physicians’ Health Study II, the only large-scale clinical trial of a daily
multivitamin, indicated a significant reduction in cataract, but an elevated, though statistically non-significant,
increased risk of AMD. These findings in men require confirmation in other men and extension to women. The
proposed study will utilize resources and data from the COcoa-Supplement and Multivitamins Outcomes Study
(COSMOS), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2x2 factorial trial testing a patented, high-quality
cocoa extract supplement (Mars Symbioscience) and Centrum Silver multivitamin (Pfizer) in the prevention of
cardiovascular disease and cancer among 12,000 women aged ≥65 years and 6,000 men aged ≥60 years with
4 years of treatment and follow-up. Woman participants will be drawn from the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI)
cohort, and male participants will be drawn from a target population screened for participation (but not
randomized) in the VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL). Beginning in June, 2015 and continuing through
2016, willing and eligible respondents to an invitational mailing will be enrolled in a 3-month run-in. Those who
demonstrate good compliance with pill taking during the run-in, and remain willing and eligible, will be randomly
assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups for 5 years. At 1-year intervals, participants will receive a new supply of
pills and a follow-up questionnaire on compliance, possible side effects, and incidence of endpoints. We
propose to document incident cataract and prevalent and incident AMD endpoints in the COSMOS cohort in
order to evaluate the efficacy of multivitamin and cocoa extract supplements in cataract and AMD prevention.
The primary aims of the proposed study are to test whether 1) a daily multivitamin will reduce the risk of
cataract; 2) a daily multivitamin will reduce the risk of total AMD events, a composite of incident AMD plus
cases of progression to advanced AMD (neovascular AMD plus central geographic atrophy) among
participants with prevalent AMD at baseline. The effect of cocoa extract supplements (capsule containing 750
mg/d flavanols, including 75 mg (-)-epicatechin, and 90 mg theobromine) in reducing risks of AMD and cataract
will be examined as secondary aims. This research is responsive to a program priority of the National Eye
Institute’s Strategic Plan to improve diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of eye disease. We believe the
proposed eye disease ancillary to COSMOS offers a unique opportunity to obtain a reliable, efficient, and
informative evaluation of the efficacy of two extremely promising preventive agents for cataract and AMD at a
fraction of the cost of separate trials.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Despite the wide-spread usage of multivitamin supplements, and the growing enthusiasm for
cocoa supplements, definitive data on the balance of risks and benefits of these agents are
lacking. Data from this large-scale randomized trial should clarify the role of multivitamin and
cocoa supplements in the prevention of cataract and AMD, two leading causes of visual
impairment in US men and women.",

Anophthalmia, microphthalmia and coloboma (MAC) are birth defects in which the eyes
are absent or very small, or where the choroid fissure fails to close in the optic cup. Most
cases are sporadic, but Mendelian pedigrees have been described, typically with low
penetrance. Few genes have been identified, encoding transcription and growth factors
(e.g. SOX2, BMP4) active during early eye development. Most cases are unexplained.
Maternal nutrition may contribute to the etiology. We found mutations in three retinoid
(vitamin A) pathway genes (RBP4, STRA6, ALDH1A3) account for >5% of MAC cases,
including a new gain-of-function mechanism for this disease. The RBP4 alleles encode
dominant-negative serum retinol binding proteins, which bind retinol cargo poorly but
adhere to the STRA6 cell surface receptor too tightly (40-fold higher affinity) – so may
disrupt retinol transfer across the yolk sac and placenta, to the embryo. The dnRBP4
mutations define a new mode of maternal inheritance and illuminate a critical protein-
receptor interaction. In addition, clustered hypomorphic STRA6 alleles suggest a new
domain function for this polytopic receptor. We will investigate the mechanism for
increased RBP affinity and critical features of the RBP-STRA6 interaction, and test the
receptor competition model for MAC pathogenesis [1] in vitro and [2] in vivo, using a
comprehensive biochemical, cell-based, radioisotopic and histological approach, mouse
models with specific knock-out or genome-edited (CRISPR/Cas9) alleles, and dietary
manipulation. In addition, [3] we will systematically screen a cohort of MAC patients
using whole exome sequencing (WES) and segmental dosage (SNP) analysis to find
causative mutations in new genes.","NARRATIVE
We will investigate gene defects in children whose eyes are absent (anophthalmia), very
small or malformed (coloboma), using biochemical methods, mouse models and
genome sequencing. Our study is centered on new mutations that appear to block retinol
(vitamin A) transport and metabolism, or the separation of neural and pigmented layers
in the developing retina. We will test new models for hereditary disease, establish a
nutritional basis for maternal inheritance of disease traits in pedigrees, and explore the
earliest steps in eye formation. The results should improve diagnosis and understanding
of eye malformations, and complex genetic factors underlying birth defects.",

(T1D), microbiota dysbiosis has been suggested as an elicitor of a break in immunological tolerance and initiation
of β-cell autoimmunity. Probiotic microorganisms may be used to prevent or restore this dysbiosis. We
have previously performed an intervention study using L. johnsonii N6.2 in rodents and found that the
administration of the microorganism reduced the incidence of T1D. Translating our rodent studies towards a
potential method for T1D prevention in humans required a pilot study in healthy individuals. We
conducted a double-blind, randomized clinical trial in 42 healthy individuals with no known risk factors for T1D to
evaluate subject responses to the consumption of L. johnsonii N6.2. The administration of L. johnsonii N6.2 was
well tolerated in adult control subjects, demonstrated systemic impacts on innate and adaptive immune
populations and resulted in a decreased kynurenine/tryptophan ratio. These data provide support for the
safety and feasibility of using L. johnsonii N6.2 in prevention trials in subjects at risk for T1D. The long term
goal of our research is to determine that the administration of L. johnsonii or its constituents will prevent T1D
onset in children. As a step in that direction, the primary goal of this proposal is to test the safety and
tolerability in adults with T1D. As a secondary outcome of this proposal, we hypothesize that the administration
of L. johnsonii N6.2 will promote tolerogenic skewing of the host immune system in the context of T1D and
may preserve β-cell function. We will achieve the goals of this proposal by evaluating the safety and tolerability
of L. johnsonii N6.2 in adults with T1D, determining the role of L. johnsonii N6.2 in immune cell activation in
adults with T1D and elucidating the mechanism of systemic signal transduction mediated by bacterial
effector components. After completion of this proposal, we will have determined that the consumption of L.
johnsonii N6.2 is safe for adults with T1D with no adverse effects on disease progression. We further expect to
have gathered evidence on the bacterial effectors of systemic responses in the host. The data obtained in the
proposal will provide a stepping stone for the use of L. johnsonii N6.2 in prevention trials in subjects at risk for
T1D.","Increasing our understanding on how beneficial microbes and their components influence disease prevention or

Despite strong anti-smoking efforts, at least 12% of American women cannot quit smoking when
pregnant, resulting in more than 450,000 smoke-exposed infants born yearly. Maternal smoking during
pregnancy adversely affects lung development as seen by lifelong decreases in pulmonary function and
increased risk of asthma. In a randomized controlled trial (RCT), published in JAMA, we have provided
evidence that maternal vitamin C supplementation (500 mg daily during pregnancy) can decrease the effects of
maternal smoking during pregnancy on offspring lung function and the subsequent incidence of wheeze. The
purpose of this ECHO application is to combine the offspring from the prenatal cohorts of two RCTs studying
the effects of vitamin C supplementation to pregnant smokers on offspring respiratory outcomes and to
determine if the innovative therapy of maternal vitamin C supplementation during pregnancy leads to
prolonged improvements on offspring’s pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and respiratory health. To begin to
understand mechanisms by which prenatal vitamin C may be preventing changes in the health of offspring of
smokers, we examined gene specific DNA methylation from a subset of placentas, cord bloods and buccal
swabs (ages 2-5) collected from subjects who were the offspring of prospectively-followed pregnant placebo-
treated smokers, vitamin C-treated smokers, or non-smokers. In parallel with the effects of vitamin C on the
reduction of the effects of maternal smoking on offspring PFTs and wheeze, the supplementary vitamin C
prevented the majority of significant changes in DNA methylation induced by maternal smoking in both
placentas and cord blood. Strikingly, this prevention of alterations in DNA methylation was still evident 2-5
years later in offspring buccal swabs. This preliminary data suggests that the mechanism underlying vitamin
C’s prevention of some of the effects of maternal smoking on offspring pulmonary health involves the
prevention of epigenetic changes induced by maternal smoking. Thus this application has 4 specific aims: 1,
to create the combined cohort of offspring from the 2 RCTs of vitamin C supplementation to pregnant smokers;
2, to determine if the protective effects of maternal vitamin C supplementation to pregnant smokers on
offspring pulmonary health extend to early adolescence; 3, to begin to characterize the epigenetic mechanisms
that appear to underlie the effects of smoking during pregnancy on offspring lung health and on the protective
effects of vitamin C; and 4, to gather core data for and interact with the overall ECHO study. Respiratory
health will be assessed by longitudinal semi-annual, validated respiratory histories and yearly PFTs beginning
at 3 years of age. Buccal swabs will be collected yearly and blood at 6, 9 and 12 years to provide DNA for
genetic analysis. DNA methylation changes will be measured by methylation chips and bisulfite sequencing.
This study will address how smoking during pregnancy affects respiratory outcomes, provide mechanistic and
therapeutic insights, and provide subjects and data to ECHO to address other key outcomes.","Narrative
Maternal smoking during pregnancy is the largest preventable cause of childhood respiratory
illness, and children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy show lifetime decreases in
pulmonary function and increased respiratory illnesses and asthma. Sadly, more than 50% of
smokers who become pregnant continue to smoke and approximately 20% of expenditures for
childhood respiratory illness are caused by maternal smoking amounting to over $1 billion
annually in current health care dollars. The purpose of this ECHO application is to combine two
prenatal cohorts to study the effects of maternal smoking during pregnancy on respiratory
outcomes, determine if the innovative therapy of maternal vitamin C supplementation during
pregnancy leads to prolonged improvements on offspring’s pulmonary function tests and
respiratory health, and to interact with the greater ECHO cohort to promote childhood health
and well-being.",

and develop to their full potential. This proposal is to conduct a follow-up study of children at age 8-12 years
whose mothers participated in a randomized control trial providing lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNS) to
pregnant women from ≤ 20 weeks of gestation through 6 months postpartum and to their children from age 6 to
18 months (n = 440), comparing outcomes to control groups who received maternal micronutrient capsules
during pregnancy and postpartum (n = 880). The objective is to examine the long-term effect of early nutrition
on brain and nervous system development, while strengthening the research environment and capacity at the

effects of a disadvantaged environment on children's development of social-emotional difficulties. The
hypotheses are that 1) children in the LNS group will have fewer social-emotional and behavioral problems,

disadvantaged home environments, and 3) intervention group differences in autonomic nervous system
regulation and white matter integrity measured by diffusion tensor imaging will mediate group differences in
social-emotional development. The rationale is based on the previous finding that children in the LNS group
had fewer social-emotional difficulties at age 4-6 years, with greater effects of LNS in children from
disadvantaged home environments, suggesting that early supplementation buffered the effect of a
disadvantaged environment on the development of social-emotional difficulties in this sample, in which a high

reducing maternal anemia. However, the effectiveness of supplementation in subgroups defined by HIV status,
anemia, gestational age, and other clinical, demographic and geographic factors remains unknown and
compliance with supplementation guidelines is variable (<50% in Botswana). Cost-effective interventions to
provide supplementation to pregnant women in Botswana and other resource-limited settings should be
designed to address key barriers to successful supplementation and to reach subgroups that would benefit
most from intervention. This K01 provides a unique opportunity to address this gap in the literature.
Candidate Overview. My long-term career objective is to become an independent investigator who specializes
in interventions to improve maternal and child health in resource-limited settings. My background is in
applications of epidemiologic methods to evaluate effects of HIV treatment strategies in adults and infants. A
K01 award will provide the necessary additional training and experience needed to become an expert in the
design, implementation, and evaluation of interventions to improve pregnancy outcomes in HIV-positive
women and underserved populations.
Career Development and Training Plan. My education program includes structured course work,
professional conferences, directed readings, and a research project with specific aims timed to coincide with
these activities. My mentorship team includes international experts who specialize in areas related to my
training goals: Dr. Scott Braithwaite (decision science), Dr. Roger Shapiro (HIV and maternal and child health
in Botswana), Dr. Donna Shelley (intervention development and implementation), and Dr. Carolyn Berry
(qualitative methods).
Environment. NYU School of Medicine provides an exceptional environment for me to conduct the proposed
study, obtain additional training and mentorship, and successfully transition to an independent investigator.
Research Strategy. Using the data and infrastructure from an ongoing birth outcomes surveillance study in
Botswana consisting of data from over 130,000 births, my study will: 1) estimate the effect of iron and folic acid
supplementation during pregnancy on adverse pregnancy outcomes by HIV status, anemia, gestational age,
and other key subgroups to identify populations that would benefit most from intervention; 2) assess barriers to
supplementation during and prior to pregnancy; 3) optimize a hypothetical intervention to provide
supplementation using computer simulation; and 4) develop and test the feasibility of an intervention to provide
supplementation to pregnant women in Botswana.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Iron and folic acid supplementation may reduce the high risk of stillbirth, preterm delivery, low birthweight and
other adverse pregnancy outcomes in resource-limited countries such as Botswana. The goal of the proposed
research is to identify and evaluate interventions to provide supplementation to pregnant women that address
key barriers to successful supplementation and reach populations that would benefit most from intervention.
The results of this work will inform supplementation strategies in Botswana and other resource-limited
countries and larger-scale intervention studies to provide supplementation to women in Botswana.",

Our broad, long-term goal is to develop rational therapeutics for the orphan disease pantothenate kinase-
associated neurodegeneration (PKAN), an inborn error of vitamin B5 metabolism that is caused by defects in
the gene that encodes PANK2, the first regulatory step in the coenzyme A biosynthetic pathway, and to do so
as cost-effectively as possible. Children and adults affected by the disease develop a severe movement
disorder and a characteristic pattern of abnormal iron accumulation in the brain. PKAN causes profound
disability and suffering, especially in children, many of whom succumb to complications of the disease in the
first decade of life. No proven disease-modifying therapy is currently available.
In this project, we will build on recent work from the laboratory demonstrating a compelling, disease-relevant
molecular and functional signature in the PKAN mouse brain that is recapitulated in both fibroblast cell cultures
and in peripheral blood from human patients. This biological signature is ameliorated in vivo and in vitro by a
product of intermediary metabolism in a dose-dependent fashion.
In this application, we propose to extend this work to the clinic, evaluating the safety, tolerability and
pharmacodynamic profile of the product in a phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-
ranging, parallel-group study in children and adults with PKAN. A 6-month double-blind phase will be followed
by an 18-month open-label phase. We will also explore the feasibility of applying a latent growth curve
modeling approach to longitudinal natural history data to capture a disease modifying effect, with the goal of
informing future study design. We will employ a novel approach to study conduct that is designed to reduce the
barriers to study participation inherent in rare disease clinical research, minimize risks to subjects, and lessen
the burden on families.","Project Narrative
Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN) is a rare disease caused by a genetic

Asthma and allergic diseases continue to be major public health problems resulting in significant disability and resource
utilization globally. Most asthma is diagnosed before the age of six. Thus, prenatal and early life exposures play an
important role in the development of asthma and allergies. On the basis of finding an inverse association between family
size and atopy, it was postulated that reduced microbial exposure in early life explains the epidemic of allergic diseases
(the “hygiene hypothesis”). The original hygiene hypothesis has undergone changes and refinement, and is now taken to
mean not just simply a reduced microbial exposure, but perhaps changes in the breadth and types of microorganisms
coupled with changing environments. The gut flora is, quantitatively, the most important postnatal source of microbial
stimulation of the immune system. Significant differences between the gut flora of children in industrialized and
developing nations suggest that the high prevalence of asthma in affluent nations may be due to changes in the
intestinal flora of young infants. This concept of “dysbiotic drift,” whereby environmental forces related to Westernized
lifestyles leads to a shift of the developing microbiota away from the norm, may explain why many chronic inflammatory
conditions, such as asthma, are associated with Westernized lifestyles. Dysbiosis is a potential mechanism by which the
environment interacts with the early developing immune system to program risk for chronic disease.
While there are a growing number of studies that are investigating the role of the intestinal microbiome in asthma,
these have examined stool samples obtained at one point in time. Since the intestinal microbiome undergoes rapid
changes before it becomes established between the ages of 1 and 3 years of life, longitudinal studies are needed.
Additionally, no studies have accounted for the host genetic background, which may determine both the development
of dysbiosis and who develops asthma when faced with dysbiosis. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that
vitamin D deficiency in the pre-, peri-, and immediate post-natal periods, in addition to host genetic influences, lead
to intestinal dysbiosis in early life. Dysbiosis, in the proper host genetic context, then increases the risk for
development of asthma. While we have collected information on a host of other relevant exposures, this proposal will
focus on vitamin D as the primary exposure of interest. We have put together 2 vitamin D clinical trial populations –
Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART) and Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood
(COPSAC2010) – with prospective collection of exposures during pregnancy and early life, that we will leverage to test our
hypotheses. This proposal is in response to FOA RFA-OD-16-004, Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes
(ECHO) Pediatric Cohorts (UG3/UH3).
In these cohorts, we will first determine the patterns of change in the early intestinal microbiome (both composition and
metabolic function) up to age 6 years that are related with vitamin D deficiency in the prenatal and perinatal periods.
We will also investigate genetic markers of the host that affect these patterns in the intestinal microbiome. We will then
investigate the relationship of these patterns of change in the microbiome with the presence of asthma by age 6 years.
Findings from this project will point to potential mechanisms by which early environmental exposures interact with the
developing intestinal microbiome and the host to confer risk for asthma.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Asthma and allergies are the most common chronic disorders in children. There is a lack of understanding of
the risk factors and mechanisms that lead to asthma and allergies. We will investigate the role of two novel risk
factors – vitamin D and the intestinal microbiome – on the risk of asthma and allergies in the child, and
findings from this important and efficient study could form the basis for development of new and important
approaches to reduction of these conditions.",

Beyond its well-established role in maintaining systemic calcium homeostasis, a substantial and growing body of
research points to the physiological importance of vitamin D as a neuroactive steroid. Despite such data,
experimental evidence of vitamin D’s direct effects on brain function in humans is all but lacking. This gap
hinders both our understanding of the role of vitamin D in human behavior as well as its therapeutic potential
for neuropsychiatric disorders (i.e., including and beyond vitamin deficiency states).
Recent preclinical (rodent) research by members of our group demonstrate important modulatory effects of the
physiologically active form of vitamin D, calcitriol, on mesolimbic dopamine (DA) systems. These data
demonstrate: 1) expression of VDRs in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) containing DA neurons of the ventral
tegmental area (VTA) and dopamine D2/3 receptor-expressing cells in striatum/nucleus accumbens (NAc); and
they further show that acute calcitriol administration: 2) increases TH expression in VTA DA neurons; 3)
increases dopamine D2/3 receptor mRNA in NAc; 4) increases microdialysate (“tonic”) and cyclic voltammetry
(“phasic”) measures of striatal DA release (including in response to amphetamine); 5) increases amphetamine-
induced locomotion, and 6) decreases drug (amphetamine) self-administration in animals. If also true of
humans, such effects would be of considerable clinical importance, given the number of human behaviors (e.g.,
learning, memory, reward, affective and information processing, etc.) mediated by mesolimbic/subcortical DA
circuits and the number of disorders (e.g., attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, addiction, depression,
Parkinson’s disease, etc.) in which mesolimbic/subcortical DA deficits have been implicated.
The current exploratory/developmental R01 seeks to test this hypothesis directly in healthy humans.
Specifically, we will assess subcortical DA function (in vivo DA release) in 20 medically and psychiatrically healthy
(vitamin D sufficient) humans using high-resolution 11C-PHNO PET. Specifically, subjects (N=20) will participate
in four 11C-PHNO PET sessions, including two pairs of pre- and post-amphetamine (0.3 mg/kg PO) scans of D2/3
receptor availability (BPND) conducted on two separate days two weeks apart. Scan days will be preceded by
placebo/active calcitriol (3.0 µg) pretreatment per a fully randomized, double-blind, counterbalanced, placebo-
controlled, within-subject design. We hypothesize that calcitriol will increase amphetamine-stimulated DA
release as reflected by greater reductions in ventral striatal D2/3 receptor availability (∆BPND) on active vs. placebo
days and that such changes will be accompanied by parallel improvements in DA-mediated behaviors.","Project Narrative

Public Health Issue: Low circulating levels of 25(OH) vitamin D (VD) have been correlated with many
adverse health conditions and health disparities in African Americans (AA). Supraphysiological high-dose VD
supplementation is required to eliminate the differences observed in the levels of circulating 25(OH)VD in AA
and white subjects. However, recent studies have questioned the therapeutic effects of high-dose VD
supplementation.
Rationale: Glutathione (GSH) is a major physiological antioxidant. Recent studies report that low levels of
GSH are linked to 25(OH)VD deficiencies in both animal and human studies. Animal studies using ZDF rats
and a mouse model of 25(OH)VD deficiency have shown that, compared to supplementation with VD-alone,
co-supplementation with VD (cholecalciferol) + L-cysteine (LC, a GSH precursor) led to an improvement in
GSH status that resulted in significant increases in circulating levels of 25(OH)VD and reduced oxidative
stress, TNF-α, and insulin resistance (IR).
Approach: AA have reduced levels of glutathione (GSH), as well as a high incidence of insulin resistance (IR)
and inflammatory disorders. This R33 application presents our design for a randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled clinical trial to test the hypothesis that supplementation with VD in combination with L-cysteine (a
GSH precursor) is more successful at optimizing the statuses of 25(OH)VD and GSH [biological signatures]
and simultaneously decreasing TNF-α and IR [functional or clinical outcomes], suggesting a better therapeutic
approach compared with supplementation with VD alone in AA subjects.
Impact on Public Health: The successful completion of this R33 clinical trial will have a significant impact on
the design of future efficacy clinical trials examining co-supplementation using a GSH precursor coupled with
lower VD doses to reduce 25(OH)VD deficiency/inadequacy, inflammation, and IR biomarkers. The
development of a safe, low-cost dietary supplement that can improve 25-hydroxy vitamin D status and reduce
insulin resistance and inflammation would provide significant benefits in the treatment of pre-diabetes and
health disparities, including chronic pain, in the African American population.
This application, which is highly responsive to PAR-18-828, will replicate previous human studies and examine
the outcome of biological signatures by combining the natural product L-cysteine with VD to optimize its
supplementation and efficacy.","NARRATIVE SUMMARY/RELEVANCE
 Two-thirds of our population is at risk for 25-hydroxy vitamin D deficiency and its associated health
hazards, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. This has led to widespread vitamin D
supplementation by the public. However, supraphysiological supplementation of vitamin D is needed to
achieve normal circulating 25-hydroxy VD levels, and some subjects respond poorly to supplementation or
experience side effects.
 The African-American (AA) population has been reported to have a higher incidence of 25-hydroxy VD
deficiency as well as clinical pain. This study will investigate whether the combined use of the nutrients VD
and L-cysteine exerts measurable and beneficial effects on 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels and insulin resistance
biomarkers. The translation and validation of our novel hypothesis could have a tremendous impact on medical
practice, leading to the novel recommendation that supplementation that combines the use of vitamin D and a
GSH precursor is superior to the current practice of supplementation with high-dose vitamin D alone.
 The long-term goal is to discover new approaches to ensure adequate 25(OH)VD status and to
prevent the adverse effects of vitamin D deficiency on health conditions in the African-American population.",

Basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and squamous precancers in-situ (CIS, also
known as actinic keratoses), are the most common of all human neoplasias and contribute significantly to the
national healthcare burden. While existing techniques such as cryoablation or surgical excision are generally
curative, those treatments cause scarring that can be especially disfiguring in patients at high risk for skin
cancer (i.e., patients with chronic severe photodamage; immunosuppression due to organ transplantation; or
Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome, BCNS). Photodynamic therapy (PDT) combines a photosensitizer
(protoporphyrin PpIX, induced by the administration of aminolevulic acid, ALA) with activation by visible light,
and is a completely nonscarring technique. PDT is approved by the FDA for field treatment of widespread
cutaneous precancers, and in European countries PDT is also approved for treating SCC and BCC. In the
U.S. however, approval of PDT for SCC and BCC will require further clinical trials to demonstrate an efficacy
similar to existing techniques (destructive ablation). As a new way to increase PDT efficacy, we showed that in
animal models of SCC and BCC, transient administration of Vitamin D (VD) prior to ALA-PDT enhances PpIX
accumulation and PDT efficacy. The oral (dietary) form of VD (cholecalciferol; D3, given as 10,000 IU/day for
10 days) increases PDT-induced tumor killing by several fold, and is very safe with little risk for inducing
hypercalcemia. In this grant, we propose to test this approach in human clinical trials using oral D3 as a
neoadjuvant to PDT. Aim 1 will examine the relationship between VD status (serium 25OH-D3) and PDT
efficacy for CIS. Subaim 1a is a longitudinal study to test the correlation between serum 25OH-D3 levels and
treatment outcomes in routine PDT patients in our clinics, and to examine the predictive value of certain
biomarkers (e.g. VDR allelic polymorphisms). Subaim 1b is an interventional trial to assess the benefit of
giving neoadjuvant D3 (transient oral D3) prior to PDT. Results from combined D3/PDT treatment (Subaim 1b)
will be compared to results after D3 alone (Subaim 1a), stratified by the VD deficiency status. In Aim 2, we will
examine the potential benefit of neoadjuvant D3/PDT in patients with BCNS (Gorlin-Goltz syndrome). These
patients, who have multiple BCC tumors will receive 3 bimonthly PDT treatments, and rates of tumor shrinkage
will be correlated with serum 25OH-D3 levels. Each patient will serve as his/her own control by randomizing
the order of the first two PDT treatments, one session to be done with neoadjuvant D3 and the other without.
The third PDT treatment will occur after the serum VD level has been adjusted to normal levels with D3
supplements. This approach will allow us to determine whether neoadjuvant D3/PDT can help all patients,
even the VD deficient individuals, through customization of D3 dose. Together, we expect this group of clinical
trials to establish the foundation for a new treatment modality, i.e., neoadjuvant D3/PDT for skin cancer. The
potential benefit for public health is that data showing improved efficacy of PDT with this safe and simple
approach will lay the foundation for a nonscarring alternative to surgery for early SCC and BCC tumors.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
This is a proposal to develop a new combination regimen that combines Vitamin D3 pretreatment with
photodynamic therapy (PDT), as a nonsurgical and non-scarring alternative for the treatment of skin cancer. In
clinical trials, we will test the hypothesis that oral Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) will boost the levels of target
photosensitizer (protoporphyrin IX) in widespread squamous cell precancers and in basal cell carcinoma, and
improve the therapeutic response to PDT. Our study population will comprise patients at high risk, including
organ transplant recipients and patients with the Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome. The potential benefit to public
health is a safe, efficacious, and non-scarring alternative to surgery for the treatment of skin cancer.",

 This proposal details a 5-year training plan to prepare the physician candidate, Thao (Tina) Ho, for a career as
an independent, translational investigator who will become a leader in the field of iron deficiency and anemia of
prematurity. The project will identify the effects of enteral iron supplementation, as prevention for anemia, on
intestinal health of preterm infants through complementary clinical and basic science studies.
 All preterm infants are at risk for iron deficiency. Enteral iron supplementation is recommended to all preterm
infants at 2-4 mg/kg/day; however, they are often given at higher doses, 6-10 mg/kg/day. Emerging evidence
suggest that enteral iron can exacerbate the overgrowth of enteric pathogens and suppress beneficial bacteria.
This imbalance, or intestinal dysbiosis, intestinal inflammation, and disrupted barrier are observed in necrotizing
enterocolitis, a devastating intestinal disease of prematurity. Preterm infants are colonized with higher
percentage of enteric pathogens at baseline compared to term infants. Dr. Ho’s preliminary data has led to the
hypothesis that high enteral iron supplementation exacerbates intestinal dysbiosis, mucosal
inflammation and permeability in preterm infants. Dr. Ho will test this hypothesis by conducting a randomized
study to compare the fecal bacterial composition, mucosal inflammation and barrier function between premature
infants given high vs. low iron regimens and investigating the cellular mechanisms with cytokine production and
gene expression using human 3D enteroid models. At the completion of this project, Dr. Ho will be experienced
in 1) designing and conducting clinical studies, 2) advanced biostatistical analyses and interpreting the results
of large clinical datasets, and 3) performing experiments on 3D cell models.
 The candidate’s independent analytical thinking will grow with regular discussions among NIH-funded
researchers and didactics provided by the University of South Florida. This award will allow her more protected
time to develop necessary skills and collaboration to establish independence by the 4-5th year. Dr. Ho will work
under the primary mentorship of Dr. Groer, an expert in translational microbiome and infant health research with
many successful mentees. To complement her primary mentor, Dr. Ho’s mentoring team, Drs. Adams and Kim,
will support her in cell culture techniques, microbiology, and genomics. Dr. Ho also has established a superb
team of scientific advisors with the following expertise: Dr. Michael Georgieff (iron and neurodevelopment), Dr.
Josef Neu (intestinal immunology), Dr. Sharon Donovan (childhood nutrition and intestinal microbiome), and Dr.
Jason Spence (3D intestinal models). They have committed their time to her career development and research
goals long before this application. Their mentorships, the fast-growing and supportive research environment at
USF, the innovative research strategy, and a focused career development plan will provide a strong platform for
Dr. Ho to secure an R01 to investigate the long-term health effects from different iron doses to optimize the
prevention of iron deficiency and anemia of prematurity.","Iron deficiency is the most common single nutrient deficiency in the world and all preterm infants 
need enteral iron supplementation to prevent iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia. 
Iron-rich environment can stimulate the growth of enteric pathogens and suppress the growth of 
beneficial bacteria. This project will clarify the effects of enteral iron 
supplementation on the developing microbiome and intestines in preterm infants and this knowledge 
will potentially impact not just the care of preterm infants but also the care of children, and 
adults with anemia.",

 Arsenic (As) exposure afflicts >140 million people in 70+ countries worldwide, including the U.S., and
contributes to cancer and many other chronic diseases. Chronic exposure to manganese (Mn), a known
neurotoxin, through contaminated drinking water afflicts 50+ countries, including the U.S., and may interact
with As exposure for some outcomes. Furthermore, enforceable drinking water standards and biomarkers of
Mn exposure are lacking. Strategies to identify individuals at risk are urgently needed. Despite years of
research, the mechanisms by which As exposure leads to adverse health outcomes remains poorly
understood. Innovative approaches are needed to characterize metabolic effects of As and Mn exposures –
prior to disease onset – to begin to better understand the underlying mechanisms, ultimately to identify
individuals at risk. Once ingested, inorganic As undergoes methylation by S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to form
mono- (MMAs) and di-methyl (DMAs) arsenicals in a process that facilitates urinary As elimination. Methyl
groups from folate are required for SAM synthesis. In our recently completed randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled folic acid clinical trial (FACT) in Bangladesh, we demonstrated that FA supplementation
significantly increased As methylation to DMAs and thereby lowered blood As and blood MMAs, a toxic
intermediate. We propose to leverage data and biological samples from FACT to employ novel ultra high-
resolution metabolomics (HRM) analyses to identify metabolites and metabolic pathways associated with As
exposure, As exposure reduction, As methylation and the independent and joint effects of Mn exposure.
 The unique FACT study design includes provision of As-removal filters with/without FA supplementation (400
or 800 µg/d × 12 or 24 weeks). This design permits us to identify and validate novel metabolites and pathways
altered by As exposure and As methylation profiles (Aim 1a); Mn exposure (Aim 1b); and reduction in As
exposure (Aim 2a). Aims 2b-c allow us to identify persistence/reversibility by FA treatment, including effects of
dose-dependent increases in As methylation facilitated by FA supplementation; and the impact of co-exposure
to Mn (Aim 2d). In a new collaboration with Dr. Walker, Director of the Metabolomics Center at Mt. Sinai, we
will combine FACT’s rigorous RCT approach–the best possible design to determine causality in humans–with
our HRM platform that interrogates thousands of metabolites and most metabolic pathways. We will use dose-
and duration-dependent approaches to enhance the rigor of our findings. In Aim 3a, in a new collaboration with
Dr. Kioumourtzoglou at Columbia, we will use novel and robust pattern recognition approaches to identify
specific metabolic patterns that are impacted by As and Mn exposures. Aim 3b will use hierarchical modeling
to comprehensively quantify the As and Mn impacts on the pathways identified in Aims 1 and 2. The findings of
this study may inform policy decisions regarding FA fortification programs in As-endemic areas and may
identify biomarkers of As and Mn exposure that may inform decisions on drinking water standards.","Project Narrative

 More than 90% of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and cognitive impairment/dementia occur in men and

disorders without effective, evidence-based interventions. The age-related increase in systolic blood
pressure (SBP) is a major factor driving the increased risk of these disorders in later middle-aged and older
(MA/O) adults. This increase in SBP is due primarily to stiffening of the large elastic arteries, as indicated by
increased carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (CFPWV), which reflects stiffening of the aorta. Aortic
stiffening with aging is mediated by structural and functional (increased vascular smooth muscle tone)
changes in the arterial wall stimulated by oxidative stress and chronic low-grade inflammation.
 New BP guidelines describe a casual (resting) SBP of 120-129 mmHg as “elevated” and SBP of 130-139
mmHg as “stage 1 hypertension”, as these levels account for much of the increased risk of CVD and other
BP-influenced disorders of aging. Importantly, ~50% of adults age >50 have SBP within these ranges. The
first-line treatment for lowering SBP in these ranges is lifestyle-based therapy. In this context, we have shown
that caloric restriction (CR) reduces SBP and CFPWV in older mice and in overweight/obese MA/O humans,
but adherence is poor and CR reduces muscle and bone mass. As a result, we have since shown that
boosting NAD+ bioavailability to stimulate SIRT-1, a “CR mimetic” approach, reduces CFPWV and oxidative
stress in old mice, and we recently took the first step in translating these findings in a small pilot study of MA/O
adults (n=24). We found that supplementation with nicotinamide riboside, a natural, commercially available

development of atherosclerotic disease and adverse cardiovascular (CV) events. However, critical knowledge
gaps must be bridged to translate these foundational works into specific, gut microbiota-targeted interventions
to reduce CV risk. These include 1) identifying mechanisms by which a selected intervention impacts the
vascular endothelial function and mediators of atheroma formation and 2) identifying differences in the impact
of a selected intervention on key populations with known differences in gut flora (including sex and obesity
status differences). This proposal will address these issues for L. plantarum 299v (Lp299v) supplementation.
Our preliminary data in 20 men with coronary artery disease (CAD) suggest that probiotic supplementation with
Lp299v has a strong and favorable impact on the vascular endothelium and a strong anti-inflammatory effect
on inflammatory cells critical to the development of endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. Our
preliminary data suggest obese CAD patients derive the greatest benefit, but whether the favorable impact of
Lp299v supplementation systematically differs in women or in obese humans with CAD remains unknown and
will be the foci of Aims 1 and 2. Our preliminary data also show improved endothelium dependent vasodilation
and reduced systemic inflammation occur concomitantly with changes in the concentrations of circulating
short-chain fatty acid (SCFAs)– known systemic metabolic products of the gut microbiota. In animal models,
SCFAs cause endothelium-dependent vasodilation by activating G protein-coupled receptor 41 (FFAR3).
Whether this novel mechanism is relevant in humans with CAD remains unknown. Our preliminary data shows
Lp299v supplementation increases circulating propionate, a three-carbon SCFA. Additionally, post-
supplementation plasma reversed impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation in resistance arteries from
CAD patients in an eNOS- and FFAR3-dependent manner. FFAR3's role in endothelium-dependent
vasodilation responses to Lp299v is a focus of in Aim 2. In Aim 3, we will test whether Lp299v
supplementation reduces pro-inflammatory signaling in human mononuclear cells known to contribute to
atherosclerosis formation and disease activity and whether FFAR3 activity is involved in this effect. The
application employs an innovative mix of translational investigations. We combine a randomized clinical trial to
study sex- and BMI-specific effects of Lp299v on vascular function using brachial artery ultrasound with critical
molecular and pharmacological studies targeting FFAR3 expression and activity in intact human vessels and
mononuclear cells. Additionally, we will employ innovative plasma-induced transcription studies and pathway
analyses to determine the impact of supplementation on whole genome transcription in human mononuclear
cells [lymphocytes (T-cell, B-cell, and NK cells) and monocytes] to determine how Lp299v impacts key
regulatory pathways involved in human vascular inflammation, atheroma formation, and plaque stability.","Recent human studies report an emerging, novel relationship between the gut microbiome and its metabolites

with L. plantatum 299v can improve blood vessel function and reduce inflammation in both men and women as

are mediated through a novel receptor (FFAR3). Our findings would support the potential L. plantatum 299v to
improve cardiovascular health in humans.",

United States military Veterans from recent conflicts are coping with symptoms related to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Many Veterans are resistant to conventional health and mental health interventions (e.g., medication, psychotherapy), and often symptoms are not significantly improved by traditional treatments. Alternative treatment methods are needed. An underlying feature of PTSD is exaggerated inflammation, both peripherally and in the central nervous system, which is thought to play an important role in the vulnerability to, aggravation of, and perpetuation of adverse consequences of this condition. Therefore, an innovative intervention strategy would be the use of anti-inflammatory/immunoregulatory probiotics to reduce inflammation. In this study, we will investigate the effects of an 8-week oral administration of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG; ATCC53103), a probiotic shown to have anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory effects on both biological signatures of systemic inflammatory processes and proximal signatures of probiotic administration. LGG is a commensal organism that colonizes the human gut mucosa and suppresses mucosal inflammation via inhibition of the production of proinflammatory cytokines. The specific aim of the study is to identify the effect of probiotics on systemic inflammation, as well as PTSD symptoms, microbiota composition, gut permeability, stress response, and decision-making. Outcomes will be assessed using a longitudinal, double blind, randomized placebo-controlled design. After initial evaluation procedures to confirm PTSD and Functional Bowel Disorder diagnoses, 59 participants will be randomized to probiotic supplementation and 59 will be randomized to placebo supplementation. The proposed line of research addresses the NIH funding opportunity purpose, “to accelerate translational and clinical Phase IIa” trials regarding “probiotic[s]” to increase “understanding regarding underlying mechanisms of their action(s), and variability in responses to these interventions”. Long-term, this study may lead to a paradigm shift in the manner by which we target clinical symptoms associated with PTSD by beginning the process of supporting a multitargeted, neuroprotective approach.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on
the host. One of the most common indications for probiotic treatment is the prevention of antibiotic-associated
diarrhea (AAD). Unfortunately, the efficacy of many probiotic products used for AAD is not supported by
rigorous independent research, and often results in non-evidence-based usage. Our research group has
worked closely with the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) to move research forward for the most well studied
Bifidobacterium strain, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (B. lactis) BB-12 (BB-12), via an Investigational
New Drug pathway. We have previously conducted two Phase I, safety trials and as per FDA requirements,
are now proposing a Phase II trial that will examine efficacy and monitor safety of BB-12 in preventing AAD.
The investigational product delivers a stable high dosage of BB-12, consistent with the findings of a Cochrane
review for preventing AAD using other strains studied outside of the United States. To explore possible
mechanisms responsible for BB-12 effects in ameliorating AAD, we will also study the gut microbiota
composition and function by collecting five fecal samples at multiple time points from all participants. The gut
microbiota includes hundreds of species of facultative and obligate anaerobes, and its disruption is
hypothesized to be an important factor in the development of AAD.
AIM 1: To test the efficacy of high dose, BB-12-supplemented yogurt in preventing AAD, compared to
yogurt without BB-12, in children receiving antibiotics.
Hypothesis: Children receiving antibiotics who receive the yogurt with BB-12 will demonstrate less diarrhea
than those receiving a control yogurt without BB-12.
AIM 2: To assess the safety of yogurt supplemented with BB-12.
Hypothesis: Yogurt containing BB-12 will be safe and well-tolerated in this larger pediatric population. This is a
Phase II trial that requires additional safety evaluation of high dose BB-12.
AIM 3: To carry out longitudinal community structure and gene expression analysis of fecal microbiota
to evaluate the impact of high dose BB-12 in a pediatric population receiving antibiotics.
Hypotheses: (i) Administration of antibiotics will alter the composition and gene expression profile of the gut
microbiota in pediatric patients, and (ii) concomitant ingestion of BB-12 in yogurt will mitigate the antibiotic-
induced disturbance in the gut microbiota, as identified using 16S rRNA and metatranscriptomic profiling.
Our long-term goal is to determine the impact of BB-12 on a variety of gastrointestinal disease states and
ages, through high-level independent research. Before we proceed with more translational effectiveness
research, this Phase II, pediatric efficacy and safety study is required by the FDA.","Project Narrative
Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in sufficient amounts, may improve health. A
common use for probiotics is for addressing gastrointestinal issues, such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea.

Maternal iron deficiency anemia (IDA) increases the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes and can negatively
impact the iron endowment of the neonate that may cause irreversible deleterious effects on neurodevelopment.
To avert IDA in pregnancy, women are universally prescribed a daily oral supplement containing ~27 mg of iron.
However, there is growing concern regarding the efficacy of this one-size-fits-all approach for women with
systemic inflammation, including women with obesity. Obese women experience disruption to the hepcidin-
ferroportin complex deeming iron from diet, including supplemental iron, and body stores less bioavailable. This
indicates an urgent need to develop and test new methods to prevent maternal IDA among women with obesity.
In this planning grant application, we will develop the clinical and research infrastructure to test the preliminary
efficacy of oral bovine lactoferrin (bLf) supplementation for the prevention of maternal IDA among obese women.
Lactoferrin is a natural compound found in secretions from mammals, including milk, and is an important
regulator of body iron balance given its effects on inflammation and the hepcidin-ferroportin complex. Daily oral
bLf has been shown to be superior to oral iron supplementation for treating IDA in pregnant women with
inflammation but has not been studied for its ability to prevent IDA in pregnancy. The specific aims of this clinical
trial planning grant include: 1) Establish the clinical and research infrastructure to recruit, enroll, and randomize
obese women at risk of IDA to an oral bLf intervention in pregnancy. In this aim we will establish, test, refine and
finalize the clinical and research infrastructure and implementation procedures, including a provider referral
system, real-time adherence monitoring, and data infrastructure; and 2) Pilot test a randomized controlled trial
of oral bLf supplementation from early second trimester up through delivery among 40 pregnant women with
obesity at risk of IDA. In this aim we seek to understand recruitment, adherence, and retention rates and
intervention acceptability to determine feasibility and preliminary efficacy on maternal inflammation and maternal
and neonatal iron and hematological-related markers. This study will provide first of its kind data, necessary and
sufficient to inform and develop a large-scale efficacy trial of oral bLf as a safe and scalable natural compound
for the prevention of IDA among obese women. Ultimately if successful, this project is an important first step
toward improving prenatal care for obese women who represent more than a third of reproductive-age women

Pregnant women in the U.S. are prescribed a daily prenatal supplement containing iron to prevent iron deficiency
anemia (IDA), a condition associated with adverse maternal and neonatal health. However, this one-size-fits-all
approach to preventing IDA may not be appropriate for women with inflammation, including obese women. We
propose to test oral lactoferrin along with a prenatal supplement devoid of iron in obese pregnant women to
assess whether it is feasible, acceptable, and potentially more effective at preventing IDA than a traditional daily
prenatal supplement containing iron.",

Abundant preclinical and epidemiologic data suggest that vitamin D possesses anti-neoplastic activity, and that
individuals with higher plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels have lower risk of colorectal cancer
(CRC) and improved survival from CRC. Despite compelling evidence implicating vitamin D in CRC, critical
questions remain about whether these findings reflect a true causal relationship, and what the biological mech-
anisms of vitamin D activity are. Our central hypothesis is that vitamin D supplementation to achieve sufficient
levels of 25(OH)D leads to improved survival in CRC patients and influences several neoplastic pathways that
can be exploited as biomarkers of efficacy and targets for novel treatment strategies. We will test this hypothe-
sis within two novel randomized clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation: a) a phase II double-blind random-
ized trial of high- versus low-dose vitamin D3 in combination with chemotherapy in patients with metastatic
CRC, and b) a randomized trial of preoperative high-dose vitamin D3 versus placebo in patients with
resectable colon cancer for examination of vitamin D biology in fresh human tumor tissue. We will also lever-
age a rich prospective cohort of metastatic CRC patients enrolled in a completed NCI-sponsored phase III trial
of chemotherapy (CALGB/SWOG 80405) to further define and validate biomarkers of vitamin D action. In Aim
1, we will determine the impact of supplemental vitamin D on survival of CRC patients, test distinct hypotheses
about the vitamin D dose-response relationship, and explore biomarkers of vitamin D status, response, and
efficacy. We will investigate whether circulating levels of vitamin D binding protein and tumoral expression of
vitamin D receptor, 1α-hydroxylase, and 24-hydroxylase are associated with improved survival within our ran-
domized trials, and whether these markers modify the relationship between vitamin D and patient outcome. In
Aim 2, we will conduct a precision medicine analysis of vitamin D to elucidate the mechanistic basis for its anti-
tumor activity in CRC. We will explore the impact of vitamin D supplementation on tumoral markers of inflam-
mation, lymphocytic infiltrates, and inflammatory gene signatures in surgical colectomy specimens from pa-
tients treated with high-dose preoperative vitamin D3 versus placebo. We will also perform next generation se-
quencing and Nanostring analysis of tumors from CRC patients with high- versus low vitamin D status to identi-
fy unique genetic and transcriptional signatures associated with vitamin D-mediated carcinogenesis. In sum-
mary, this translational proposal leverages innovative randomized trials of vitamin D to take the next critical
steps in understanding vitamin D activity and biology in CRC. Our findings will confirm causality, provide new
insights into biomarkers of vitamin D activity, and lead to potential inclusion of vitamin D into standard therapy
– including immunotherapy – with the ultimate goal of improving the survival of patients with CRC.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
The proposed research is relevant to public health because colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of
cancer death in the U.S., and may plausibly be linked to vitamin D deficiency. Abundant preclinical and epide-
miologic data link lower levels of vitamin D to increased risk of and mortality from colorectal cancer; this is par-
ticularly relevant given increasing rates of vitamin D deficiency in the U.S., as well as profound racial disparities
in vitamin D status and colorectal cancer incidence and mortality. In an era of expensive and often toxic anti-
neoplastic drugs, vitamin D therefore represents an attractive and accessible treatment option for patients of all
races and sociodemographic groups with respect to both safety and cost.",

CANDIDATE: Christopher R. Martens, Ph.D., is a fellow training in the integrative physiology of aging at the
University of Colorado Boulder. In this K01 application, Dr. Martens aims to study the efficacy of a novel NAD+
boosting and calorie restriction-mimetic compound, nicotinamide riboside (NR), for reducing large elastic artery
stiffness and blood pressure in older adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and to relate these
outcomes to improvements in cerebrovascular, cognitive and neuronal function. His immediate goal is to acquire
the research training and professional skills necessary to transition to an independent investigator. His long-
term goal is to establish his own research program, with a focus on identifying strategies for improving
cerebrovascular and cognitive/neuronal function and reducing risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in older adults.
CAREER DEVELOPMENT PLAN: Dr. Martens proposes to enhance his career development by: 1) acquiring
new skills in the assessment of cerebrovascular, cognitive and neuronal function to support his proposed
research plan; 2) receiving training in aMCI and AD pathophysiology, geriatrics and biostatistics; and 3) refining
his professional skills through formal course work, attendance and presentations at weekly journal clubs,
university seminars, and national scientific meetings, and through regular interactions with his mentoring team.
ENVIRONMENT: Dr. Martens will train in an outstanding aging research environment supported by a multi-
disciplinary team of mentors who will provide him with research and career development training. The primary
mentor, Dr. Seals, is an internationally recognized NIA-funded scientist with a strong record of successful
mentoring in vascular aging research. Co-Mentor Dr. Hughson is a leading expert in cerebrovascular function
and brain aging, and Dr. Bettcher has extensive experience assessing cognitive function in patients with aMCI.
Dr. Banich is director of the neuroimaging center at CU-Boulder and has extensive experience with the
proposed MRI-based assessments of neuronal function and structure. Dr. McQueen is director of biostatistics
at the CU-Boulder Clinical and Translational Research Center (CTRC) and regularly provides mentoring and
consulting to trainees and faculty conducting clinical trials. Co-mentors Dr. Potter and Dr. Schwartz are senior
NIA investigators with expertise in AD and geriatric medicine, respectively, and their mentorship will
complement the research training & objectives. RESEARCH: aMCI is the earliest symptomatic stage in the
development of AD, which is among the fastest growing causes of morbidity and mortality in the US. Stiffening
of the large elastic arteries (i.e., the aorta and carotid arteries) occurs with aging and has been linked to the
development of aMCI and AD, primarily through the transmission of damaging pressure waves to the cerebral
vasculature, resulting in cerebrovascular dysfunction and neuronal damage. The proposed research seeks to
test the efficacy a novel CR-mimicking dietary supplement, NR, for lowering arterial stiffness in patients with
aMCI and associating these changes with improved cerebrovascular, cognitive and neuronal function.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Stiffening of the elastic arteries occurs with aging and likely contributes to memory loss and risk of Alzheimer's
disease, primarily by impacting blood vessels within the brain. This study will provide insight into whether a
new dietary supplement that mimics the beneficial effects of calorie restriction, reduces arterial stiffness,
improves arterial function within the brain and restores brain function and memory in patients with “amnestic”
mild cognitive impairment. Overall, this project has the potential to identify a novel, safe and cost-effective
strategy for decreasing age-related memory loss.",

 Overactive bladder (OAB), the presence of urgency, frequency, and nocturia, is common with aging, as is
urgency urinary incontinence (UUI). These are among the most bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms –
associated with worse mental health, poor physical well-being, and increased falls, fractures, and nursing
home placement. Despite treatment options, many patients do not become symptom-free and discontinue
medications due to side effects or perceived inefficacy. Attention is shifting to possible prevention and early
treatment strategies. Potential benefits of vitamin D may extend to several relevant organ systems, and vitamin
D could act via multiple pathways to reduce lower urinary tract symptoms by improving detrusor activity and
decreasing inflammation. Indeed, evidence emerging from epidemiologic studies indicate that higher vitamin D
levels are associated with decreased risk for OAB and UI.
 In this revision application, we will leverage two large, complementary epidemiologic studies – the VITamin D
and omegA-3 TriaL (VITAL, n=25,000 women and men) and the observational Nurses’ Health Studies
(n>100,000 women) -- to conduct a rich exploration of vitamin D and OAB, as well as UUI. In this revision, we
extend research to both OAB and UUI, increasing clinical relevance by broadening the outcomes (previously
only UI) while focusing on symptoms related to detrusor contractility. We also improve innovation by targeting
research in: (1) African Americans (n=2300 in NHS, n=5200 in VITAL), who disproportionately suffer from OAB
and UUI, and have higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency; and in (2) obese adults (n=34,000 in NHS,
n=7200 in VITAL), who are at higher risk of OAB and UUI, and have lower bioavailability of vitamin D as it is
retained in adipose tissue. Our main Aims are to: 1) assess if vitamin D3 supplementation decreases OAB and
UUI in VITAL, where participants have been assigned to 2000IU/day of vitamin D or placebo for five years, and
in NHS, where observational data are available on a large range of doses, from <400 IU to >800 and >1000
IU/day; and 2) to prospectively assess if higher plasma 25(OH)D levels at baseline are related to a decreased
incidence and progression of UUI in the NHS. In VITAL, where an estimated 50% of participants had
25(OH)D<30ng/mL at baseline, we propose to collect data on OAB and UI symptoms at year 5 by adding new
questions on urgency, frequency, nocturia and urine leakage at the close of the trial. The NHS already includes
extensive UUI data, and we will newly measure baseline vitamin D levels from stored blood samples and add
OAB questions in upcoming follow-up periods. The large samples of African American and of obese adults in
these cohorts uniquely enable important and novel research. The expected outcomes will be to provide
exciting new knowledge regarding vitamin D as a possible convenient, low-cost intervention for
preventing OAB and UUI symptoms and progression among women and men, specifically targeting
high-risk subgroups of African Americans and obese adults.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Overactive bladder (OAB) can occur with or without urgency urinary incontinence (UUI). OAB and UUI affects
the lives of millions of men and women and is very costly. Emerging evidence from epidemiologic studies link
higher vitamin D levels with lower rates of OAB and UUI. With this proposal, our goal is to understand the
relationship of vitamin D supplementation compared to placebo on OAB and UUI symptoms, especially in high-
risk subgroups. We will also evaluate how supplementation may improve new-onset OAB and UUI over time.",

Adequate diet quality has the potential to promote childhood cognitive health and have a lasting impact on
children’s ability for learning and achievement. My laboratory has identified that lutein, a plant pigment or
carotenoid found in rich quantities in dark green vegetables, is uniquely suitable for supporting childhood
cognition and achievement. Lutein is the predominant carotenoid in neural tissue, serving roles as an antioxidant
across neural membranes. Further, lutein, along with two other carotenoids (i.e., zeaxanthin and
mesozeaxanthin) accumulate in the macular as macular pigment, which is known to strongly correlate with brain
lutein. My work has linked macular pigment optical density (MPOD) – a noninvasive measure of retinal and brain
lutein – to greater childhood cognitive function. However, the cognitive implications of lutein and zeaxanthin
intake in children have not been directly investigated. This proposal aims to establish a causal relationship
between lutein intake, cognitive function, and academic performance. The central hypothesis is that lutein
consumption will benefit cognitive function and academic achievement in preadolescents. I also anticipate that
gains in cognitive outcomes will be mediated by the improvement in MPOD. These hypotheses will be tested by
conducting a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trial to examine the effects of 9-month carotenoid
supplementation on MPOD, cognition (attention and memory), and achievement among 8-10-year-old children
(N=288, 144/group). The active supplement will comprise of 10mg lutein + 2mg zeaxanthin. This work will provide
the evidence-base for recommendations to improve dietary practices for optimal childhood cognitive function
and achievement. The proposed research is relevant to human health and the NIH mission because it will provide
novel data supporting evidence-based recommendations to improve dietary practices for optimal cognitive
function and achievement in childhood.","Project Narrative
The proposed research is relevant to human health because it will provide novel data supporting evidence-based
recommendations to improve dietary practices for optimal cognitive function and achievement in childhood.
Establishing the evidence base for nutrients that may have neurocognitive implications is particularly important
given that the majority of children in the United States perpetually consume diets that fail to achieve their
recommended servings of vegetables. Therefore, by furthering our understanding of nutrition for children’s
cognitive function, the proposed research is relevant to the NIH mission to improve the health of the nation.",

percent are women, and 82% have remained in academic medicine settings. As part of this program, the
applicant will create a more detailed and structured mentorship program for his trainees who are interested in
careers in patient-oriented clinical/translational research in vascular biology and physiology. This K24 application
is scientifically centered on determining the vascular and inflammatory impact of supplementation of humans
with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) with the probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum 299v (Lp299v). This proposal represents
a natural outgrowth of the applicant's current work. Despite aggressive traditional risk factor modification and
glycemic control efforts with even the most recent glycemic control agents with favorable cardiovascular profiles,
atherosclerotic vascular diseases and microvascular disease continue to disproportionately impact individuals
with diabetes mellitus (DM). Vascular disease in T2DM begins with the development of vascular endothelial
dysfunction. The applicant's group recently reported that once daily supplementation with Lp299v results in
improved endothelial function and reduced systemic vascular inflammation in men with stable coronary artery
disease. This was the first report of a probiotic supplement having a favorable impact on vascular endothelial
function in humans. While this data supports the concept that Lp299v improves vascular endothelial function and
reduces systemic inflammation, only three individuals in the pilot study had T2DM. Whether the favorable effects
of Lp299v supplementation extend to humans with T2DM remains uncertain. Equipose regarding impact of
Lp299v supplementation in human T2DM is further supported by the known significant differences in the
composition and metabolism of the gut microbiota of humans with T2DM suggesting the interaction of T2DM gut
microbiota with Lp299v may significantly differ compared to those without diabetes. The applicant's preliminary
data suggest Lp299v's favorable impact on endothelium-dependent vasodilation and vascular inflammation may
be magnified in individuals with T2DM. We will test the hypothesis that Lp299v supplementation improves
endothelium-dependent vasodilation and microvascular function, reduces inflammation, and improves insulin
sensitivity in humans with T2DM in the setting of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover
clinical trial. The proposed studies will both advance our knowledge about a novel method for reducing vascular

the next generation of researchers in vascular-centered patient-oriented research.","Recent human studies report an emerging, novel relationship between the gut microbiome and its metabolites
with the development of heart attacks and strokes. This application will determine whether these favorable effects

dramatically worldwide. It is estimated that obesity is second only to smoking as a cause of premature
preventable death. This is largely due to the comorbidities associated with obesity including metabolic syndrome,
diabetes, cardiovascular disease and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Yet, very little progress has been made in
the development of treatments to prevent obesity and its comorbidities, and the mechanistic link between obesity
and development of comorbidities is not completely understood. Several studies have shown that obese rodents
develop tissue vitamin A deficiency, with tissue retinoid concentrations decreasing by a stunning 75-90%,
suggesting profound metabolic dysregulation. Findings in cell systems and animal models demonstrate that
retinoids regulate adipocyte differentiation and glucose and lipid metabolism and, further, that decreased retinoid
concentrations are associated with progressive obesity, insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. Thus,
aggregate preclinical data suggest that altered vitamin A metabolism may contribute directly to obesity
progression and the development of obesity-related co-morbidities. Critically, the mechanisms underlying this
dysregulated vitamin A metabolism remain poorly understood, and the relevance of these preclinical findings to
human obesity is unclear. A central premise of this proposal is that altered vitamin A metabolism in obesity is a
result of increased inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6 and TNF in metabolic tissues, which regulate the
expression of the retinoid metabolizing enzymes CYP26, LRAT, ALDH1A and RDH in adipocytes and various
liver cell types. We further hypothesize that this dysregulation of vitamin A metabolism occurs in human obesity
as well as in animal models. We will test our hypotheses in two specific aims: 1) to identify the enzymes and the
key regulatory signals that control all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) concentrations and vitamin A metabolic flux in
human liver and adipose tissue, and 2) to establish whether adipose tissue and liver vitamin A metabolomes are
altered in obese humans. We will use our state-of-the-art mass spectrometry methods, innovative metabolic flux
experiments and kinetic modeling in specific cell types to characterize the key enzymes that metabolize retinoids
in liver and adipose tissue and determine how the activity of these enzymes is altered in obesity. To determine
whether tissue retinoids are altered in human obesity, we will conduct a cross sectional clinical study comparing
visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue, liver and serum vitamin A metabolomes in obese and non-obese
subjects. The proposed studies will lay the foundation for understanding the regulation of vitamin A metabolism
in human liver and adipose tissue and for determing how vitamin A metabolism may become dysregulated in
obesity contributing to progressive obesity and its co-morbidities in humans. The results will generate
unprecedented insight into human retinoid biology and ultimately could lead to targeted therapeutic interventions
designed to restore tissue retinoid signaling as a novel strategy for the treatment of obesity and its sequela.","The obesity epidemic is a major public health burden and incurs annual healthcare costs in excess of $150
million in the U.S. alone. Rodent models suggest that obesity is associated with significant tissue vitamin A
deficiency which, in turn, contributes to progressive obesity and development of obesity-associated co-
morbidities. This project will help define the mechanisms regulating tissue-specific vitamin A metabolism in
humans, determine the relevance of preclinical findings to human obesity, and establish whether tissue retinoids
may be potential novel treatment targets for obesity and its associated co-morbidities.",

Risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) is significantly elevated in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD);
however, this increased risk is only partially explained by traditional CV risk factors. Arterial dysfunction is an
important nontraditional CV risk factor gaining increased recognition in the field of nephrology. While many
changes likely contribute to the development of arterial dysfunction in patients with CKD, among those of
greatest concern is the development of stiffening of the large elastic arteries. This process is best represented,
both physiologically and pathophysiologically, by increases in the gold standard measure of arterial stiffening,
carotid to femoral artery pulse wave velocity (CFPWV), which reflects, in particular, increases in aortic
stiffness. Aortic stiffening with CKD is mediated by structural and functional (increased vascular smooth
muscle tone) changes in the arterial wall stimulated by oxidative stress and chronic low-grade
inflammation. Caloric restriction (CR) is a promising strategy for prevention of CKD-associated arterial
dysfunction and CVD. In this context, we have shown that CR reduces CFPWV and SBP in older mice and in
overweight/obese middle-age and older adults. However, long-term adherence to chronic CR regimens with
optimal nutrition is very difficult to achieve and unlikely to become clinically relevant in the near future as it may
reduce muscle and bone mass. As a result, we have since shown that boosting NAD+ bioavailability to
stimulate SIRT-1, a “CR mimetic” approach, reduces CFPW and oxidative stress in old mice, and we recently
took the first step in translating these findings in a study of middle-age and older adults with normal kidney
function and elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP). We found that supplementation with nicotinamide
riboside, a natural, commercially available precursor of NAD+ and novel CR mimetic, was well tolerated and
increased NAD+ bioavailability and reduced CFPWV and SBP. Here we propose a randomized, placebo-
controlled, double-blind, single-site phase IIa clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of oral
nicotinamide riboside (500 mg capsules 2x/day; NIAGEN®; ChromaDex Inc.) for 3 months vs. placebo
(n=59/group) for decreasing aortic stiffness and SBP in men and women (35-80 years) with stage III and IV
CKD. We hypothesize that treatment will be safe and well-tolerated, and will reduce CFPWV and SBP, as
related to increases in systemic NAD+ bioavailability and reductions in oxidative stress, inflammation and
vasoconstrictor factors.
Aim 1: To measure CFPWV (primary outcome) before/after nicotinamide riboside vs. placebo treatment;
Aim 2: To measure casual and 24h-ambulatory SBP (secondary outcome) before and after treatment;
Aim 3: To determine the safety and tolerability of treatment with nicotinamide riboside vs. placebo;
Aim 4: To measure systemic NAD+ and NAD+–related metabolite concentrations, as well as circulating
markers of oxidative stress, inflammation, and vasoconstriction factors before and after treatment.","Project Narrative
The proposed research will determine the effectiveness of nicotinamide riboside, a natural supplement and
novel alternative approach to mimic the effects of sustained calorie restriction (i.e., “dieting”) for improving the

will study the effects on clinic and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure and will provide insight into how
nicotinamide riboside improves artery health by assessing novel physiological mechanisms (biological

There is mounting evidence that low vitamin D blood levels are associated with increased risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). There are several mechanisms by which low vitamin D status may promote AD
pathology, including reduced β-amyloid (Aβ) clearance, dysregulation of calcium influx and glutamate-
mediated neurotoxicity. Vitamin D interacts with receptors in the hippocampus and many other brain regions,
and has established antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Recent neuroimaging studies have found that
low vitamin D levels are associated with increased periventricular white matter disease, reduced white matter
volume and larger ventricles. Vitamin D deficiency may also have a toxic effect on brain function independent
of Aβ metabolism. Preliminary studies of serum vitamin D levels in a diverse multi-ethnic cohort (n=382) of the
UC Davis Alzheimer's Disease Center found a high prevalence of low vitamin D status (61% with levels <20
ng/ml), which was associated with faster rates of decline on executive function and episodic memory.
This Phase II randomized clinical trial aims to test if supplementation with high dose oral vitamin D will
successfully correct vitamin D insufficiency, compared to treatment with standard (RDA) dose vitamin D in a
diverse community-based elderly cohort. The effect of high-dose vs. standard-dose vitamin D on altering
cognitive trajectories will also be assessed and data will be expected to be used in designing a potential
definitive Phase III trial in elderly groups at risk for dementia. A total of 180 elderly persons with longitudinal
biomarkers, neuropsychological testing and brain MRI scans will be enrolled, with 152 (~50 with MCI, 50 with

With partnering Native American communities, the UNM Metals Exposure and Toxicity Assessment on Tribal 
Lands in the Southwest (UNM METALS) team has obtained evidence for community level exposures and 
health risks associated with more than 1100 abandoned uranium mine (AUM) waste sites on their tribal lands. 
This project will address underlying mechanisms to account for immune dysregulation, including early 
molecular markers of autoimmunity, associated with proximity to AUM and uranium and mixed metal exposure. 
Biomonitoring results confirm that community members are exposed to uranium and other metals beyond 
national norms. Our published and preliminary work shows that certain metals interact with key cellular targets 
to disrupt zinc-dependent protein function. We will test the hypothesis that metals disrupt multiple classes of 
zinc binding proteins known to regulate immune responses, and that supplemental zinc will mitigate 
immunotoxicity resulting from metal exposures. In Aim 1 aim we will investigate whether serum zinc sufficiency 
modifies immune dysregulation in individuals exposed to environmental metals by performing a cross-sectional 
analysis of archived population samples for associations between markers of immune function with metal and 
zinc levels present in blood and urine samples. Aim 2 will test the immunotoxic effects and underlying 
mechanisms of U, As and environmentally relevant metal mixtures defined by the Environmental Projects, and 
whether the immunotoxic effects are reduced by supplemental zinc in cell and mouse models. Aim 3 will test 
whether dietary zinc supplementation will decrease biomarkers of immune dysregulation in exposed 
populations in partnership with exposed communities. The work is innovative by combining exposure 
information and biomonitoring data from exposed populations with mechanistic studies in experimental models. 
To date, there are no significant, community-based health studies describing both exposure and immunologic 
outcome measures in these impacted Tribal communities. We propose a novel hypothesis that metals 
exposures disrupt multiple classes of Zn binding proteins critical for immune function leading to immune 
dysregulation and that supplemental Zn will mitigate metal toxicity. This study represents the first human 
intervention based on zinc supplementation to ameliorate the adverse effects of mixed metal exposures. To 
achieve the research goals, BP1 is well integrated with the Environmental Projects to inform distinct metals 
exposures, BP2 to share mechanistic data and model systems, the Community Engagement and Research 
Translation Cores for community input and reporting results back to the communities, and the Biostatistics and 
Data Management Core for research support. The outcomes from these studies will be significant by testing 
metals and metals mixtures of concern to communities to elucidate impact on and mechanisms of immune 
dysregulation as detected in exposed populations, and test the feasibility of a mechanism-based intervention to 
alleviate the adverse effects of metals exposures.","Project 3 – BioProject 1 (BP1) - Project Narrative

ABSTRACT
In addition to the primary effects on calcium homeostasis, Vitamin D has important effects on both
innate and adaptive immunity in humans. However, the degree to which these pleotropic effects of
Vitamin D influences specific immune responses to infections and cancer in humans is not known.
Indolent B-cell lymphoma represents a unique model system to define the effect of Vitamin D on the
immune response to cancer. Gene expression profiling studies demonstrate the importance of
immune-based signatures in the lymph node microenvironment on prognosis in follicular lymphoma. A
recently published study identified that immune-infiltration measured by PD-L2 expression in the
microenvironment of follicular lymphoma is strongly predictive of outcome, where low immune
infiltration was associated with increased risk of early relapse after initial therapy and ultimately
increased risk of death. As Vitamin D can upregulate tissue-specific PD-L1 and PD-L2 surface
glycoprotein expression in humans as a direct transcriptional inducer through the Vitamin D receptor,
Vitamin D may directly influence the immune response to malignancy. Our current R01 (CA214890)
funds a phase 3 clinical trial termed ILyAD (Indolent Lymphoma And Vitamin D), which randomizes
patients being treated with rituximab to Vitamin D supplementation with oral cholecalciferol 2000IU
daily, or placebo daily. At baseline and in follow-up, all patients have blood obtained for Vitamin D
levels, shipped to URMC labs on day of blood draw for central batched analysis using the gold standard
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS) method. Therefore, we have the unprecedented
opportunity to discover the direct relationship of Vitamin D treatment to immunomodulation in the setting
of indolent lymphoma. In this supplement, we propose to assess the tumor biopsies of patients in
ILyAD to assess immune infiltration, and correlate to baseline Vitamin D level. To evaluate specific cell
populations of interest, we will further characterize the immune infiltration patterns observed in tumors
from patients with low and high Vitamin D levels using spatial genomics. Leveraging the power of our
randomized, prospective trial, we will determine if Vitamin D supplementation can overcome the
negative prognosis of low immune infiltration on the trial. These assays therefore incorporate a
potential biomarker of response to Vitamin D, and providing important mechanistic insights around
Vitamin D with implications in other benign and malignant immune-reactive conditions.

Advancing age is associated with numerous changes in gastrointestinal physiology and function which can influence the
amount and type of nutrients delivered to the small intestine and colon. These changes, along with altered immune
function, can affect the composition and function of the gut microbiota. However, the role of these changes on the
impaired glucose homeostasis observed with aging is unknown. Interestingly, gut microbiota-generated trimethylamine
N-oxide (TMAO), a metabolite of bacterial choline metabolism, increases with advancing age in both mice and humans
and the latter is believed to be a consequence of age-related gut dysbiosis. Indeed, there is an increase in the
abundance of trimethylamine-producing bacteria with aging. The overall objective of this R21 proposal is to establish
proof-of-concept for a greater impairment in glucose homeostasis following increases in gut microbiota-generated TMAO
in older compared with young adults in order to conduct a larger, more comprehensive and mechanistic trial in the future.
To this end, following a two-week lead-in controlled diet, 20 healthy young adults (18-34 yrs) and 20 healthy older (65-
79 yrs) adults will complete a 4-week randomized crossover trial of both choline bitartrate (1000 mg/d) or placebo. A 2-
week washout period with continued controlled feeding will separate the treatments. All subjects will be fed an isocaloric
diet (50% carbohydrate, 35% fat,15% protein) controlled for fiber and micronutrient content for the duration of the study
to avoid the potential confound of individual differences in diet on gut microbiota. Measurements of insulin sensitivity
and beta cell function via IVGTT, glucose tolerance via mixed meal tolerance test, and 24-hr glycemic control using
continuous glucose monitoring, TMAO concentration by UPLC-MS/MS, inflammatory cytokines via ELISA, and gut
microbiota composition/function using 16S rRNA pyrosequencing and targeted qt-PCR, respectively will be made before
and following each 4-week treatment period. The findings from this integrative physiological study have significant
translational potential as they may advance basic science findings in rodents to humans and provide novel mechanistic
insight into observational studies in humans by establishing a specific role of the gut microbiome in modulating insulin
sensitivity and 24-hr glycemic control with aging. In turn, the gut microbiota may be a key target for therapies that
contribute to the maintenance of normal glucose homeostasis with aging. Importantly, our study may provide rationale
for individualizing nutritional or pharmaceutical interventions that target the gut microbiota as an interface between the
food we eat and host physiology.","Project Narrative
Advancing age is associated with changes in the composition of bacterial communities in the gut that may
predispose to developing type 2 diabetes. There is an increase in the abundance of bacteria involved in metabolism
of dietary choline, and its metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide, with advancing age. The overall objective of this R21

This Administrative Supplement will contribute important findings related to dietary predictors of newborn
outcomes in the Cumulative Effects of Prenatal Stress and Chemical Exposures on Child Development
(ECHO.CA.IL, NIH 5UH3OD023272) parent study. ECHO.CA.IL is co-led by researchers at the University of
Illinois, Urbana-Champaign and the University of California, San Francisco and is a part of the nation-wide
Environmental influences of Child Health Outcomes Program (ECHO). The mission of the ECHO program is to
enhance the health of children for generations to come, and a critical goal of ECHO.CA.IL is to use innovative
methods to address gaps in our knowledge of the impacts of prenatal exposures to ubiquitous endocrine
disrupting chemicals (EDC) and chronic maternal stress (as well as the interaction of these) on birth outcomes
and child development.
 The proposed Supplement aims align with both the parent study and with two of the five target health-related
goals in the ECHO program: (1) pre-, peri-, and postnatal outcomes, and (2) positive health. The proposed
research will utilize data from the Illinois Kids Development Study (I-KIDS), which is the prospective pregnancy
cohort being recruited at the University of Illinois. I-KIDS, enrolls women in the first trimester of pregnancy and
longitudinally follows mothers and their children during pregnancy and throughout childhood. In addition to
evaluating the impacts of EDCs and maternal stress on child outcomes, we also have a strong interest in
assessing diet in I-KIDS mothers to understand whether diet could buffer the negative effects of EDCs and stress
during pregnancy. To that end, a novel preliminary finding from I-KIDS mothers and babies demonstrates that
high maternal diet quality may mitigate the negative effects of one class of EDCs (parabens) on birth outcomes,
suggesting that maternal diet may protect pregnant women and their infants from the deleterious effects of EDCs.
However, while almost all (99%) of pregnant women in our cohort consume some type of vitamin/mineral
supplement and 97% consume a prenatal supplement, we have not investigated how supplements contribute to
pregnancy outcomes in our cohort, or whether certain patterns of supplement intake modify relationships
between EDCs and birth outcomes. Therefore, the overarching goal of the current research will be to use an
innovative statistical approach developed to deal with complex mixtures of environmental chemicals (weighted
quantile sum regression) to 1) evaluate associations between patterns of micronutrient intake from supplements
in pregnancy and birth outcomes (birth weight, length, head circumference, gestational age at birth), and 2)
understand how these patterns of micronutrient intakes from supplements interact with maternal diet quality and
EDC exposures to influence birth outcomes.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Virtually all pregnant women are encouraged to consume a prenatal or other multiple vitamin/mineral supplement
to support fetal growth and improve birth outcomes. The current study will use an innovative statistical approach
to evaluate associations of cumulative and distinct patterns of maternal micronutrient intake from supplements

maternal diet quality and with exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals to influence birth outcomes.",

Although the adverse effects associated with prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) are well known, many women
continue to drink heavily during pregnancy, putting their infants at risk for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.
Given the limited effectiveness of psychosocial and informational interventions, there is a growing interest in
new approaches, such as nutritional interventions, that may be more effective. Animal studies have shown that
choline supplementation during the equivalent of the 3rd trimester in humans can mitigate effects of PAE on
growth and development. However, findings from studies in humans to date have been inconsistent and
difficult to interpret. Choline, an essential nutrient, serves as a methyl-group donor for DNA methylation and is
a constituent of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and a precursor to major components of cell membranes. In
an R21 feasibility trial, 70 heavy drinkers were randomly assigned to receive a daily dose of 2g of choline or a
placebo from time of enrollment in antenatal care until delivery. Participants were recruited from the Cape
Coloured (mixed ancestry) community in Cape Town, South Africa, where the incidence of heavy drinking during
pregnancy and fetal alcohol syndrome are among the highest in the world. Infants in the choline-treated arm
were more likely to meet criterion for eyeblink conditioning than those in the placebo arm. Infants born to both
the choline- and placebo-treated mothers were small at birth, but those in the choline arm showed
considerable catch-up growth in weight and head circumference by 6.5 mo, which persisted through 12 mo. At
12 mo, infants in the choline arm showed markedly better recognition memory compared to placebo-treated on
the Fagan Test of Infant Intelligence, which is known to have predictive validity for school-age IQ. Key features
of this study included the higher choline dose (4.4 times adequate intake (AI), compared to 1.7-2.5 in previous
human studies) and initiation of treatment early in pregnancy. We propose to recruit heavy drinking pregnant
women from a rural Cape Coloured community to participate in a fully-powered, double-blind, randomized,
placebo-controlled choline supplementation trial (1) to assess the effectiveness of maternal choline
supplementation during pregnancy to mitigate effects of PAE on three primary outcomes: infant recognition
memory and postnatal growth restriction (weight and head circumference); (2) to assess the efficacy of this
supplementation for mitigating alcohol effects on the following secondary outcomes: infant eyeblink
conditioning, postnatal length, and information processing speed; (3) to use innovative methods from causal
inference analysis to examine protocol adherence as an important source of variation in treatment efficacy and
to identify socio-demographic factors associated with non-compliance in order to facilitate implementation of
the intervention protocol in clinical settings; and (4) in exploratory analyses, to examine whether maternal
choline supplementation is particularly effective in women with lower dietary choline intake or poor nutritional
status.
!","Public Health Relevance
Given the limited effectiveness of informational and psychosocial interventions in addressing the
continuing major health risks associated with maternal heavy alcohol consumption and binge
drinking during pregnancy, there is growing interest in new approaches, such as nutritional
interventions, that may be more effective in reducing the risks associated with fetal alcohol
spectrum disorders (FASD). Extensive data from animal studies and preliminary data from our
R21 maternal choline supplementation feasibility study suggest that daily supplementation with
a high dose of the nutrient choline initiated early in pregnancy can be effective in mitigating a
range of adverse effects on growth and neurobehavioral function seen in FASD. The proposed
fully-powered, phase II, double blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial is designed to confirm
these findings, thereby providing the basis for implementation of this promising, highly
innovative intervention in clinical settings.",

Anophthalmia, microphthalmia and coloboma (MAC) are birth defects in which the eyes
are absent or very small, or where the choroid fissure fails to close in the optic cup. Most
cases are sporadic, but Mendelian pedigrees have been described, typically with low
penetrance. Few genes have been identified, encoding transcription and growth factors
(e.g. SOX2, BMP4) active during early eye development. Most cases are unexplained.
Maternal nutrition may contribute to the etiology. We found that mutations in 3 retinoid
(vitamin A) pathway genes (RBP4, STRA6, ALDH1A3) account for >5% of MAC cases,
including a new gain-of-function mechanism for this disease. The RBP4 alleles encode
dominant-negative serum retinol binding proteins, which bind retinol cargo poorly but
adhere to the STRA6 cell surface receptor too tightly (40-fold higher affinity) – so may
disrupt retinol transfer across the yolk sac and placenta, to the embryo. The dnRBP4
mutations define a new mode of maternal inheritance and illuminate a critical protein-
receptor interaction. In addition, clustered STRA6 point mutations suggest a new domain
function for this polytopic receptor. We will investigate the mechanism for increased RBP
affinity and critical features of the RBP-STRA6 interaction, and test the receptor comp-
etition model for MAC pathogenesis [
1
] in vitro and [
2
] in vivo, using a comprehensive
biochemical, cell-based, radioisotopic and histological approach, mouse models with
specific knock-out or genome-edited (CRISPR/Cas9) alleles, and dietary manipulation.
In addition, [ ] we will systematically screen a cohort of MAC patients using exome
3
sequencing (WES) and segmental dosage (SNP) analysis to find causative mutations in
new genes, and will explore the developmental basis in compelling cases. One example
is BASR (bilateral anophthalmia with sex reversal), arising from an X-autosome translo-
cation, with trans-fating of RPE to neural retina as a potential mechanism. We will test
this hypothesis in vitro (chromatin topology and iPSC differentiation assays) and in vivo
(specific transgenic mice).","NARRATIVE
We will investigate gene defects in children whose eyes are absent (anophthalmia), very
small or malformed (coloboma), using biochemical methods, mouse models and
genome sequencing. Our study is centered on new mutations that appear to block retinol
(vitamin A) transport or metabolism, or the separation of neural and pigmented layers in
the developing retina; as such, we will test new models for hereditary disease, establish
a nutritional basis for maternal inheritance of phenotypic traits in pedigrees, and explore
the earliest steps in eye formation. The results should improve diagnosis and understan-
ding of eye malformations, and complex genetic factors underlying birth defects. ",

Uterine fibroids (i.e. leiomyomas) affect 30 to 50% of reproductive-age women that are strongly associated with
reducing the likelihood of pregnancy (RR=0.3-0.7) when compared to unaffected women. Surgical removal of
fibroids can restore fertility, however, the benefits are often short due to a high recurrence rate of fibroids.
Post-operative consequences are another concern as adhesions can negatively impact a woman’s fertility and
overall health. Pharmacological approaches to reduce uterine fibroids include hormonal therapies, however,
they also lead to pharmacologically-induced menopause thereby preventing pregnancy. For this reason, there
is a critical and unmet need to identify safe and orally bioavailable non-hormonal and non-surgical treatment
options for women with fibroids that distort the uterine cavity. One such approach is being investigated in the
parent grant (1R01HD100367) evaluating the hypothesis that EGCG can reduce fibroid size and increase the
likelihood of pregnancy. Briefly, the parent grant is supporting a placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate live
birth outcomes for women with unexplained infertility who have uterine fibroids. The objective of this proposal
is to complement the parent project (1R01HD100367) to identify clinically relevant mechanisms of folate
depletion and determine if a clinically relevant natural product drug interaction (NPDI) exists between fertility
treatment and green tea extract. a consortium as described in RFA-HD-19-022 was formed. Yale will serve as
the DCC and a clinical site, John Hopkins will coordinate the single IRB and be a clinical site. Investigators at
UIC have experience with EGCG and clinical trials and will serve as lead PI. MTHFR represents the most
studied enzyme in the folate pathway for neural tube defects and with strong evidence that polymorphisms
decrease enzyme activity it represents a clinically relevant target. Another critical enzyme in the folate pathway
is dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) which has been shown to be inhibited by select small molecules including
green tea catechins. We are proposing to stratify subjects by wildtype MTHFR, MTHFR (C677T), and MTHFR
(A1298C). The prevalence of MTHFR mutations can range from 30 to 40% in the American population for
C677T and ~50% for A1298C. Green tea extract has been reported to decrease folic acid levels through two
mechanisms that include the inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and decreasing the bioavailability of
folic acid. Our hypothesis is that green tea catechins have weak inhibitory DHFR properties that may increase
the risk of folic acid depletion in women expressing known MTHFR polymorphisms. To test our hypothesis, we
have proposed two specific aims. Specific Aim 1. To determine if MTHFR polymorphisms increase the risk of
folate depletion in women receiving green tea extract. Specific Aim 2. To determine if a clinically relevant
natural product-drug interaction (NPDI) exists in women receiving green tea polyphenols who have been
randomized to either clomiphene or letrozole.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
The proposed research is relevant to public health because MTHFR gene mutations in combination with
specific phytochemicals have the potential to decrease active folic acid blood levels in women of child bearing

discoveries, innovative research strategies, and their applications as a basis for ultimately protecting and

Septic shock is a common and highly morbid clinical syndrome that affects over 200,000 patients in the United
States annually and results in over 40,000 deaths. Kidney failure is a frequent complication of sepsis and
septic shock that is associated with worse outcomes. To date, the understanding of kidney injury in sepsis and
septic shock has traditionally focused on decreased blood pressure leading to kidney hypoperfusion. Recent
studies have challenged this paradigm, however, illustrating that sepsis associated kidney injury often occurs
even when perfusion is adequate. These findings suggest that alternative pathophysiologic mechanisms may
have a role in sepsis related kidney injury. The mechanisms remain poorly understood and as yet there are no
proven interventions aimed at mitigating sepsis-induced kidney injury.
Thiamine (vitamin B1), a key cofactor of pyruvate dehydrogenase, is a critical component of oxidative
phosphorylation (i.e. aerobic mitochondrial respiration). In the absence of thiamine, mitochondrial metabolism
shifts towards anaerobic energy production, which is inefficient and results in lactate production. Thiamine
deficiency has also been linked to increased levels of reactive oxygen species. Our research group has
previously demonstrated that thiamine deficiency is common in critical illness and inversely associated with
lactate levels. We hypothesize that thiamine deficiency during critical illness may occur due to increased
metabolic demand which rapidly consumes available thiamine stores.
In a randomized trial, our research group has found that the administration of thiamine to thiamine deficient
patients with septic shock leads to reduced lactate at 24-hours. In a post-hoc analysis of that study, my work
has shown that patients (including both thiamine replete and thiamine deficient patients) who received thiamine
had lower creatinine values at 24-hours and were less likely to require kidney replacement therapy (e.g.
dialysis). Our research group has also shown improved cellular oxygen consumption in septic patients and
cardiac surgery patients who receive thiamine.
Given the above, we hypothesize that thiamine attenuates kidney injury during septic shock by supporting
aerobic mitochondrial metabolism. To test this hypothesis, we have planned a randomized, double-blind
placebo-controlled trial of thiamine to improve in kidney function in patients with septic shock. This award will
allow me to further develop as a physician-investigator and to test important hypotheses with potentially
significant therapeutic benefits for patients with sepsis and septic shock.","Project Narrative

thiamine, a B vitamin, may prevent kidney injury during septic shock. To test this hypothesis, we propose a

 The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 that causes Coronavirus Disease 2019
(COVID-19) disproportionately affects older adults such that individuals 60 years and older have markedly
increased risk of infection, severity of morbidity, and mortality. This increased vulnerability with aging is due in
part to greater systemic inflammation and oxidative stress, impaired nitric oxide (NO)-mediated endothelial
dysfunction, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) deficiency both at baseline and post-infection. As
such, novel “geroprotective strategies” that: 1) improve baseline risk factor profile for COVID-19; and 2)
restore NAD+ levels, inhibit inflammation and oxidative stress, and improve NO bioavailability/endothelial
dysfunction induced during infection, are essential for reducing severity/lethality of COVID-19 in older adults.
 We recently showed that chronic supplementation (6 weeks) with nicotinamide riboside, a natural dietary
compound, boosts NAD+ bioavailability in older adults. We then translated the results of this pilot study into
an NIA-funded (R01 AG061514) phase IIa randomized clinical trial assessing the efficacy of 3 months of
nicotinamide riboside treatment for lowering systolic blood pressure (SBP) and aortic stiffness in older adults
with baseline SBP in the elevated to stage 1 hypertension range. This 5-year clinical trial is currently in year 2.
 The pathogenesis of COVID-19 includes NAD+ deficiency, hyper-inflammation, excessive reactive oxygen
species (ROS) bioactivity, and pulmonary and systemic NO-mediated endothelial dysfunction. Our preliminary
results in older adults suggest that nicotinamide riboside reduces pro-inflammatory cytokine production in
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), decreases endothelial ROS bioactivity, increases endothelial NO
production, and improves in vivo systemic vascular endothelial function. However, these promising initial
findings must be confirmed in a larger cohort to establish the potential efficacy of nicotinamide riboside
supplementation as a geroprotective strategy for prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in older adults.
 The purpose of this administrative supplement is to address a major research objective for the NIA
Division of Geriatrics and Clinical Gerontology in NOT-AG-20-022: The evaluation of pharmacological
interventions that may prevent or mitigate morbidity and/or improve post-infection health in older adults
exposed to SARS-CoV-2. This will be accomplished by: 1) assessing PBMC inflammatory cytokine production
before/after nicotinamide riboside treatment and incubation with specific NAD+-pathway metabolites; 2)
evaluating ex vivo endothelial function in human pulmonary artery endothelial cells bathed in subject serum
with/without COVID-19-like inflammatory and oxidative stress ± protective NAD+ metabolites; and 3) assessing
in vivo systemic endothelial function with nicotinamide riboside treatment. The expected results will establish
nicotinamide riboside as a promising geroprotective strategy for: a) reducing risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection; b)
inhibiting multiple pathways driving COVID-19 morbidity; and c) aiding post-infection recovery in older adults.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Infection rates, severity of morbidity, and lethality from the pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)

One in four people with HIV (PWH) report hazardous drinking [i.e., >7 (14) drinks per week or >3 (4) drinks per
occasion for women (men)]. Of this population, 65% report depressive symptoms or smoking, and 21% report
all three- constituting an alcohol-associated syndemic (i.e., interaction of 2+ conditions to increase risk for poor
outcomes). This syndemic is associated with increased risk of incident cardiovascular disease (CVD). The
gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome is a strong candidate mechanistic pathway for the syndemic-related excess
CVD risk, through GI dysbiosis, microbial translocation (MT), and systemic inflammation. Dysbiosis is
characterized as a decrease in beneficial bacteria and increase in pro-inflammatory bacteria. GI dysbiosis
leads to MT, in which tight junctions of the GI lumen are compromised, driving systemic inflammation- a
leading cause of CVD. HIV, hazardous drinking, smoking and depression are independently associated with GI
dysbiosis, MT and inflammation. Beneficial butyrate producing bacteria, which downregulate pro-inflammatory
mediators, are depleted in hazardous drinking PWH. In humans with alcohol use disorder, probiotic use
attenuates MT and inflammation. Among PWH, probiotic (e.g., butyrate producing bacteria) with prebiotic use
(nutrients for bacterial growth), a combination known as “synbiotic”, favorably alters the GI microbiome within
4-16 weeks. We hypothesize that the alcohol-associated syndemic is associated with GI dysbiosis and
subsequent CVD related biomarkers and that targeted supplementation may restore GI microbiome

Medical Center (VUMC), my career development plan will advance skills in clinical investigation of alcohol
syndemic phenotypes; microbiome structure, function, diversity and immunology; clinical & translational
research; and primary data collection, responsible conduct of research, and leadership. Aim 1 will identify
changes in the GI microbiome among PWH with the alcohol-associated syndemic over 12 months, Aim 2 will
determine changes in biomarker profiles related to GI permeability, MT, and inflammation among PWH with the
alcohol-associated syndemic over 12 months, and Aim 3 will evaluate the a) feasibility of administering a
butyrate supplement pill followed by a multi-strain synbiotic (prebiotic + probiotic) pill and b) treatment effects
on GI microbiome structures and CVD-related biomarkers among PWH with the alcohol-associated syndemic
(n=40). Aims 1 & 2 leverage secondary data from an NIAAA-funded microbiome study of 200 PWH with
existing GI microbiome data, sero-biomarker data, and validated self-reports of alcohol use, smoking, and
depressive symptoms. Aim 3 utilizes the infrastructure of the Tennessee Center for AIDS Research at VUMC,
which has a strong record of supporting Early Career Faculty. This award will facilitate my transition to an
independent investigator with expertise in alcohol/CVD epidemiology, microbiome structure and function, and
clinical trial development among PWH, and will also provide informative data for an R01 application.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
People with HIV-infection and concurrent hazardous drinking, smoking, and depressive symptoms (i.e.,
alcohol-associated syndemic) experience higher risk of cardiovascular disease compared to those without
these behavioral health conditions. The gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome is a strong candidate mechanistic
pathway for the syndemic-related excess CVD risk, through GI dysbiosis, microbial translocation (MT), and
systemic inflammation. This proposal aims to test the hypotheses that the alcohol-associated syndemic is
associated with GI dysbiosis and subsequent CVD risk and that targeted supplementation may restore GI
microbiome homeostasis and reduce inflammation; aligning with NIAAA’s objectives to prevent and treat HIV-
associated comorbidities and invest in HIV/alcohol translational research that addresses health and behavioral
issues clearly linked with HIV in the context of HIV, other substance use/addiction and mental health disorders.",

With increased interest in patient-centered outcomes research and precision medicine, investigation of
heterogeneity of treatment effect (HTE) in clinical trials has emerged as a key area of study. HTE is an
assessment of the degree to which the impact of an intervention varies between subgroups. Evidence from trials
of selenium supplementation indicates that this is a critical area for investigation of HTE. To date, three major
clinical trials of the trace element selenium (Se) as a chemopreventive agent have been completed. First, in the
Nutritional Prevention of Cancer (NPC) trial, participants were supplemented with 200 µg of Se per day or
matching placebo, and a statistically significant 58% reduction in colorectal cancer incidence among participants
randomized to receive the selenium supplement was observed. Next, the results of the Selenium and Vitamin E
Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) were published. The largest trial to date of Se for cancer prevention,
SELECT demonstrated no reduction in risk of colorectal cancer among men supplemented with 200 µg/d of Se
as L-selenomethionine. We have recently completed the Selenium Trial, which was the third major clinical trial
of Se for chemoprevention. This was a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in
which 1535 participants received 200 µg/d of Se as selenized yeast or placebo to ascertain whether Se
supplementation reduced the risk of colorectal adenoma recurrence. No differences in overall colorectal
adenoma recurrence by intervention group were detected; however, subgroup analyses revealed the presence
of heterogeneity of treatment effect (HTE). Among participants who had an advanced adenoma at baseline,
there was a statistically significant reduction in adenoma recurrence for those randomized to Se as compared to
placebo. However, there was also a statistically significant increase in the incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D)
among older participants (>63 years) receiving selenium. These results identify a major research gap regarding
the need for identification of individual characteristics that may contribute to HTE and thus determine whether
Se supplementation elicits a beneficial or harmful effect. This is a particularly timely question given that
approximately half of American adults report using dietary supplements. We propose herein to investigate
several factors that may affect individual outcomes related to Se supplementation, including 1) Genetic
background; 2) Intake and blood concentrations of fat-soluble antioxidants; and 3) Oxylipin profiles in response
to Se supplementation. In summary, we contend that the in vivo efficacy and toxicity of Se in a given individual
may be influenced by genetic background, interactions with antioxidants, and oxylipin metabolomic profiles. The
findings of this study will have a direct impact on public health recommendations by identifying individual
characteristics that may elicit either beneficial or harmful health effects of Se supplementation.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
The proposed work has the potential to make major contributions to public health recommendations
regarding the potential benefits and harms of selenium supplements. We have designed three separate but
complementary aims that will elucidate factors that elicit individual differential responses to selenium
supplementation using genetic analysis, consideration of fat-soluble antioxidant interactions, and targeted
oxylipin profiling.",

Asthma continues to represent a major global public health problem resulting in significant disability and
resource utilization. Most asthma is diagnosed before the age of six years and is preceded by episodes of
troublesome lung symptoms – wheezing, in the years after birth. Asthma is a complex disease with both
genetic and environmental exposures contributing to its development: ORMDL3 and FADS are well-replicated
asthma genes while vitamin D2-5 and n-3 polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs)6 have recently been identified as
important prenatal risk factors for asthma. Despite the identification of these risk factors, a complete
mechanistic understanding of how these exposures and genes operate together to impact asthma
development remains unknown. Metabolomic profiling has the distinct advantage of being a marker that
reflects the cumulative sum of past and current environmental and genetic exposures leading to the disease.
Our preliminary metabolomics work has successfully identified associations between prenatal exposures
(Vitamin D, n-3 PUFAs), asthma genes (ORMDL3 and FADS), and metabolites, thereby providing a direct
mechanistic connection of how these risk variants may operate together to influence disease development.
The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that the sphingolipid and eicosanoid pathways are important in
asthma pathogenesis and may enlighten the mechanisms through which asthma genes (e.g. ORMDL3, FADS)
and prenatal early life exposures (vitamin D and n-3 PUFAs) operate to cause or prevent asthma. For this
proposal, we will capitalize on two randomized clinical trials with analogous study design and follow-up
strategies – Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART) and Copenhagen Studies on Asthma in
Childhood (COPSAC2010). Together these studies showed that prenatal vitamin D and n-3 PUFAs in
supplementation reduce the risk of persistent wheeze/asthma in the first 3 years of life by 23% (p<0.01) and
32%6 (p=0.035) respectively. In this proposal we will: 1) Assess the effect of the maternal metabolome and
prenatal exposures on the child metabolome; 2) Study the relationship between metabolites in the sphingolipid
pathway, the ORMDL3 risk variant, and prenatal vitamin D supplementation on asthma risk; 3) Study the
relationship between pro- and anti-inflammatory eicosanoids, genetic variants in FADS, and prenatal n-3 PUFA
supplementation on asthma risk. Findings from this important study will have great public health importance in
elucidating mechanisms involved in the development of asthma in children and could lead to preventive
strategies against asthma in childhood.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Being the most common health-related cause of lost school and work days, asthma has a large public health
impact. We study potential mechanisms for asthma development in two biological pathways where we believe
asthma genes and prenatal vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid supplementation operate to alter asthma risk. We
will use 1,218 mother/child pairs from two randomized controlled trial birth cohorts that have data rich in
prenatal exposures, clinical measures, metabolomics, and genetics.",

The purpose of this K01 career development award submission is to support a period of didactic training and
mentored research for Dr. Traci Bethea, Assistant Professor at Boston University School of Medicine, to
increase her ability to carry out studies of cancer survivorship and to become an independent cancer
researcher. Dr. Bethea’s long-term goal is to carry out studies that will result in a better understanding of
factors that influence cancer survivorship and that will lead, ultimately, to higher survival among Black women
affected by breast cancer and reduced cancer health disparities. She has already had training in environmental
health and cancer epidemiology. Through the K01 training, she will develop expertise in cancer survivorship,
statistical analyses of survival data, and molecular epidemiology, under the mentorship of a distinguished
panel of researchers – Drs. Julie Palmer, Christine Ambrosone, Nancy Keating, Michael LaValley, and Edward
Ruiz-Narváez. The mortality rate from breast cancer, the most commonly occurring cancer among women in
the U.S., is 42% higher in Black women than White women. Dr. Bethea’s research will address an
understudied topic, modifiable factors related to breast cancer survivorship in Black women. To this end, her
proposed research utilizes data from the Black Women’s Health Study (BWHS), a longitudinal study of 59,000
African American women. During follow-up, more than 2,300 incident invasive breast cancer cases have
occurred and they will be the subject of Dr. Bethea’s research. Dr. Bethea will assess several modifiable risk
factors – post-diagnosis use of aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and post-
diagnosis use of vitamin D supplements and of predicted plasma vitamin D levels – in relation to breast cancer
recurrence and breast cancer-specific mortality among breast cancer cases in the BWHS. She will create
genetic risk scores using data on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from candidate genes and will
assess whether the associations of aspirin/other NSAIDs or of vitamin D supplementation and predicted
plasma vitamin D levels with breast cancer recurrence and breast cancer-specific mortality are modified by
genetic risk scores. Thus, Dr. Bethea will create a specific area of research in which she is highly proficient. As
an independent researcher, it is anticipated that she will lead further BWHS research on cancer survivorship,
which could be stand-alone studies or collaborative studies with other investigators. Dr. Bethea is an
outstanding candidate. A K01 career development award will enable her to conduct important research as an
independent investigator and put her on the path to obtaining NIH R01 and similar grant support and on a path
to promotion. Importantly, it will also provide valuable information on factors related to breast cancer survival in
Black women.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
The proposal will support didactic training and mentored research in cancer survival and molecular

The ultimate goal of this research is to develop a means to safely administer iron supplements to infants in
settings with a high infection burden. The hypothesis underlying this project is that promoting development of a
beneficial, protective gut microbiota by co-administration of prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) and iron-
sequestering bovine lactoferrin (bLF) during iron supplementation will prevent iron-induced increases of
opportunistic enteropathogens that cause infection and inflammation. The proposed research will extend our
established strategy of conjoining investigations in vivo with intestinal fermentation and cellular models in vitro.
We will conduct a randomized clinical trial in 6 month-old Kenyan infants in conjunction with mechanistic
microbiota studies using our established long-term continuous polyfermenter platform inoculated with
immobilized fecal microbiota from Kenyan infants. The period from about 6 months to 1 year of age is vital both
for iron nutrition and for the establishment of a healthy gut microbiome that promotes immune system
development, local immune homeostasis and limits pathogen colonization. Oral iron supplements are
associated with a significant 15% increase in the rate of diarrhea in children in malaria-endemic areas. Our
most recent studies have shown that prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) can provide partial amelioration
of the adverse effects of iron-induced dysbiosis by enhancing the growth of barrier populations of bifidobacteria
and lactobacilli. We hypothesize that the combination of prebiotic GOS with bovine lactoferrin (bLF), adding
iron sequestration, antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities, will provide virtually complete protection
against the adverse effects of added iron on the intestinal microbiota. Our research has two specific aims:
 (1) to conduct a randomized, controlled double-blind 9-month clinical trial in 6-month old Kenyan infants
 comparing the effects on gut microbiome composition among groups receiving in-home fortification
 for 6 months with micronutrient powders containing 5 mg iron (as sodium iron EDTA [2.5 mg] and
 ferrous fumarate [2.5 mg]) and (i) galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS; 7.5 g), (ii) bovine lactoferrin (bLF, 1.0
 g), (iii) GOS (7.5 g) and bLF (1.0 g), and (iv) no GOS or bLF. Each infant will then be followed for an
 additional 3 months to determine the longer-term effects of the treatments.
 (2) to examine mechanisms of prebiotic GOS and iron-sequestering bLF on microbiota composition,
 enteropathogen development, microbiota functions and metabolic activity, and inflammatory potential
 in vitro with treatments paralleling those in Specific Aim 1, using immobilized fecal microbiota from
 Kenyan infants to inoculate our established long-term continuous polyfermenter intestinal model

 Autoimmune diseases affect ~ 5% of the U.S. population and carry a high burden of morbidity, health care
costs, disability, and premature mortality. In the first cycle of this award, we leveraged an innovative nationwide
NIH-funded double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial, VITAL, to test the effects of vitamin D (vitamin
D3 [cholecalciferol]) and marine omega-3 fatty acid (eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] + docosahexaenoic acid
[DHA]) supplements upon the risk of incident autoimmune disease and changes in biomarkers of systemic
inflammation. Data from laboratory studies, observational epidemiologic research, and small prevention trials
strongly suggest that these nutritional agents have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating benefits. Popular
enthusiasm for vitamin D and fish oil supplements underscores the urgent need for rigorous testing. We have
recruited, randomized, and are following 25,874 VITAL participants, men aged ≥50 and women aged ≥55
nationwide, including 20% African Americans. Following a 3 month run-in, eligible participants were randomly
assigned to one of four treatment groups: vitamin D3 (2000 IU/d) and fish oil (EPA+DHA, 1 g/d); vitamin D3 and
fish oil placebo; placebo vitamin D3 and fish oil; and placebo vitamin D3 and placebo fish oil. At yearly intervals,
all participants receive a new pill supply, are asked about compliance and side effects, and report incident
autoimmune diseases. A physician endpoints committee has confirmed 444 incident autoimmune disease
cases by medical record review to date. In a randomly selected subcohort of 1634 VITAL participants, blood
samples have been assayed for changes in C-reactive peptide, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-
receptor 2 in all four trial arms. With this renewal grant, we will complete the 5 pre-specified years and a 2 year
observational extension, critically important given the long latency of autoimmune disease onset. Continued
follow-up will improve statistical power for detecting preventive effects on autoimmune disease incidence, and
will enable investigations of effects over time and effect modification by baseline factors and biomarkers. We
hypothesize that there will be a delayed reduction in autoimmune disease, and that the largest preventive
effects will be among those with high systemic inflammation, including the obese and those with elevated
baseline biomarkers of inflammation. In this renewal, we also will test for changes in “Specialized Pro-
Resolving Mediators” (SPM), novel omega-3 fatty acid-dependent lipids responsible for inflammation
resolution. We will employ cutting-edge quantitative liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy to
extend understanding of the biological mechanisms by which omega-3 fatty acids influence inflammation
resolution and potentially autoimmune disease pathogenesis. Given the ongoing NIH-funded VITAL trial
infrastructure, our strong multidisciplinary research team, and success with prior large mail-based trials and
cohort studies, with continued funding these investigations will furnish robust and definitive results with
important public health ramifications.","NARRATIVE
 Autoimmune diseases affect ~ 5% of the U.S. population and carry a high burden of
morbidity, health care costs, disability, and premature mortality. The purported health benefits of
vitamin D and marine omega-3 fatty acids for preventing autoimmune diseases and decreasing
systemic inflammation receive enormous attention in the medical literature and popular press,
but definitive data supporting the beneficial effects of these two readily available over-the-
counter agents are lacking. This nationwide double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized

Patients undergoing surgery to treat their bladder cancer face very high rates of complications and mortality.
The radical cystectomy operation is fraught with the highest complication rates of all urologic oncology
surgeries performed and is also extremely catabolic. As the National Cancer Institute has identified in its
provocative questions 2 & 11, variations in immune function and nutritional interventions affect the
response to cancer treatment. Radical cystectomy will continue to save lives, but there is a high cost in terms
of persistent surgical complications. The long-term goal of this project is to unlock the potential of nutrition
interventions to improve outcomes, survival, and quality of life in cancer patients. The objective of this project
is to determine the impact of a specialized form of nutritional support on surgical outcomes and to better
understand the mechanisms by which it acts. The hypothesis is that perioperative use of a specialized form of
nutritional support will have greater efficacy than a standard form of nutritional support to reduce post-
operative complications. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of published preliminary data
produced in the applicants' laboratories and expert guidelines calling for more rigorous study of this
approach. The rationale is that Specialized IMmunonutrition (SIM) is fortified with nutrients (L-arginine,
omega-3 fatty acids, dietary nucleotides, and vitamin A) that have immediate effects on immune and
inflammatory responses, muscle sparing, and wound healing after surgery. Guided by strong preliminary
data, the hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: 1) To determine the impact of perioperative SIM
versus an identical Oral Nutrition Support (ONS) lacking the immuno-modulators on post-operative
complications from RC; 2) To compare the impact of SIM to ONS on secondary clinical outcomes after RC
surgery; 3) To evaluate the impact of consuming SIM compared to ONS for restraining myeloid-derived
suppressor cells (MDSCs), decreasing inflammation, and modulating nutrient metabolism. The project is
significant because it offers a high yield, low-risk, low-cost strategy to improve the outcome of patients with
bladder cancer who undergo RC. Our innovative approach could transform clinical practice to reduce post-
operative complications, thereby diminishing the burden of bladder cancer surgery and has the added
potential to help many other surgical patients beyond cystectomy.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

There are high prevalences of osteoporotic fractures and vitamin D deficiency in the U.S., especially among
older adults. Although vitamin D supplements are widely used to improve bone health, evidence for a role of
supplemental vitamin D alone in reducing fractures is lacking. While the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]
level is considered the best analyte to assess vitamin D status, currently there is no consensus on the optimal
circulating total 25(OH)D concentration for bone. While, like many hormones, vitamin D circulates bound to
proteins, the relative importance of free 25(OH)D (FVD) or bioavailable 25(OH)D levels on fracture risk is not
known. New advances in technology make it possible to directly measure the biologically active, FVD level.
Results from recent observational studies on whether FVD and/or bioavailable 25(OH)D are more strongly
associated than total 25(OH)D levels with calcium homeostasis and bone mineral density (BMD) are
inconsistent. In addition, there are no data from large, randomized controlled trials on whether bioavailable
25(OH)D and/or FVD vs. total 25(OH)D levels or gene variations in vitamin D-related pathways modify effects
of supplemental vitamin D on fractures and changes in BMD. To fill gaps in knowledge, we propose an
ancillary study to the large, NIH-sponsored, randomized, controlled VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL)
that is testing effects of supplemental vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol, 2000 IU/d), and/or omega-3 fatty acids (fish
oil, 1 g/d) in the primary prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease in 25,874 U.S. men (aged ≥50) and
women (aged ≥55), including 5,107 African Americans. The proposed ancillary study will definitively determine
whether supplemental, high-dose, vitamin D3 alone reduces incident total, non-vertebral and hip fractures by
extending adjudication of fractures to the full 5 years of treatment in 25,874 VITAL participants nationwide. The
proposed studies will also rigorously test whether concentrations of bioavailable 25(OH)D and/or FVD are
more strongly associated with changes in BMD and incident fractures than total 25(OH)D levels; and whether
these vitamin D biomarkers and genetic variants in vitamin D-related pathways modify effects of supplemental
vitamin D on BMD and fracture risk. For each of the proposed aims, we will assess whether results vary by (a)
sex, (b) race/ethnicity, and (c) BMI. Key VITAL resources will be leveraged at no additional cost to the
proposed studies including: blood samples and BMD measurements (at baseline and follow-up), extensive
data on changes in 25(OH)D levels over time (in the treatment vs. placebo arms), measures of calcium
homeostasis, information on clinical risk factors, and extracted DNA. This proposal provides a unique and cost-
efficient opportunity to generate important positive or informative negative results about effects of supplemental
vitamin D3 alone on fracture risk, while also elucidating the relative importance of vitamin D biomarkers and
genetic variations in vitamin D-related pathways on bone. Findings from the proposed ancillary study have the

Falls and decreased physical function increase markedly with age and result in injury, hospitalization, and
death. Safe, cost-effective primary prevention strategies are needed to reduce these adverse outcomes in the
aging U.S. population. Basic, preclinical, and clinical studies suggest that flavanols, a class of nutrients present
in high concentrations in cocoa, have favorable effects on muscle and physical performance. Flavanols
decrease oxidative stress and improve biomarkers of mitochondrial biogenesis and muscle growth. Emerging
studies show potential benefits of supplemental cocoa flavanols on physical performance, including grip
strength and walking speed in older adults. However, there are no large, long-term randomized controlled trials
(RCTs) of the effects of supplemental flavanols on falls, muscle performance, and/or fall-related injuries. In an
ancillary study to the COcoa Supplement and Multivitamins Outcomes Study (COSMOS), which is testing the
effects of supplemental cocoa flavanols and/or multivitamin for the prevention of cardiovascular disease and
cancer, we propose the first large, placebo-controlled, prospective study to determine whether supplemental
flavanols reduce falls and improve musculoskeletal health in women aged ≥ 65 and men aged ≥ 60. In the
proposed study, we will determine effects of a cocoa flavanol supplement [600 mg/d flavanols, including 80 mg
(-)- epicatechins] and/or multivitamin on the following clinically meaningful outcomes: falls in the overall
COSMOS cohort (n=21,444) and physical performance in a clinic sub-cohort (n=603). We will test the following
hypotheses: Aim 1: In the overall COSMOS cohort, cocoa flavanol supplementation will reduce risk of: (a)
injurious fall(s) resulting in a visit to a healthcare provider or hospital with medical record review and (b) two or
more falls per year and (c) injurious fall(s) (not resulting in healthcare utilization) as assessed by annual
questionnaires. Aim 2: In the clinic sub-cohort, cocoa flavanol supplementation will benefit physical
performance measures at 2-year post randomization, as assessed by grip strength, walking speed, and Short
Physical Performance Battery (a composite of standing balance, walking speed, and chair stands). Aim 3: In
the overall COSMOS cohort, cocoa flavanol supplementation reduces incident fractures as assessed by
annual questionnaires. We will explore whether effects of cocoa flavanols on fracture outcomes are mediated
through falls and/or bone density changes. In exploratory aims we will also assess effects of multivitamins on
these same outcomes. RCTs testing effects of multivitamins on falls and musculoskeletal outcomes are
lacking. This ancillary study maximizes cost-efficiency to fill gaps in knowledge regarding effects of flavanols
for the primary prevention of falls. We expect the proposed, rigorous translational study will elucidate whether
supplemental flavanols improve musculoskeletal health and prevent falls and declining physical performance in
the increasing number of older adults in the U.S. with potential for clinical and public health benefits.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Cocoa products, containing high concentrations of flavanols, are widely used and their health benefits have
received increasing attention in the medical literature. Promising results from preclinical and clinical studies
show beneficial effects of flavanols on muscle and physical performance, but no large, randomized controlled
trials have tested effects of supplemental cocoa flavanols on clinically meaningful outcomes among aging
adults. This study will determine whether supplemental cocoa flavanols slow age-related declines in physical
performance and decrease falls and fall-related fractures (broken bones) that are major public health problems
in older women and men in the U.S.",

Cocoa products have become a widely consumed food, with growing demand across the world and steadily
increasing interest in its potential health benefits and anti-aging biology. However, the role of cocoa consumption
on epigenetic aging remains essentially unexplored. There has been compelling evidence for the anti-
inflammatory role of cocoa and cocoa-derived flavanols based upon in vitro and animal models. However, a
critical barrier of research progress remains the lack of definitive large-scale randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
Accelerated epigenetic aging that comprises DNA methylation changes has recently emerged as a powerful,
novel predictor for lifespan and health span, disease susceptibility, morbidity, and mortality risk. Further,
inflammaging is a highly significant risk factor for both morbidity and mortality in the elderly, as many age-related
diseases including cardiovascular disease (CVD) share an inflammatory pathogenesis. As such, interventions
to slow or mitigate epigenetic aging and inflammaging are critical for promoting healthy aging.
 The COcoa Supplement and Multivitamin Outcomes Study (COSMOS) is an ongoing randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled, 2x2 factorial RCT of a high-quality cocoa extract supplement (containing 600 mg/d
flavanols, including 80 mg epicatechins), and a multivitamin supplement to reduce the risk of CVD and cancer
in women aged ≥65 years and men aged ≥60 years. COSMOS has randomized 21,444 participants into the trial,
including 2,006 participants with bio-samples already collected at baseline, year 1 and year 2 follow-up.
COSMOS is the only large RCT testing the effects of cocoa extract in women and men, and for multivitamins in
women. Thus, this proposed ancillary study will build upon the parent COSMOS trial to examine the effects of
randomized cocoa or multivitamin supplementation on anti-aging (epigenetic aging and inflammaging) in 600
representative subjects with three bio-sample collections at baseline, year 1, and year 2, as well as measured
CVD risk factors, and examining these findings in the context of CVD outcomes. We will test our central
hypotheses that cocoa supplementation reduces epigenetic aging indices (e.g., AgeAccelHorvath,
AgeAccelHannum, AgeAccelGrim, AgeAccelPheno, and DNAmTLadjAge) and inflammaging (serum hsCRP, IL-
1β, IL-4, IL-6, and TNF-α) over time. We will also determine to what extent the effects of cocoa supplementation
on inflammaging and CVD risk factors are mediated by epigenetic aging.
 The purported anti-aging health benefits of cocoa-rich products such as dark chocolate have popularized and
increased consumption of cocoa-rich products over the past decade. Moreover, multivitamins remain the most
common dietary supplement taken by at least one-third of older US adults. It remains of critical public health
importance to rigorously test the anti-aging properties of these two supplements via large RCTs for more
definitive evidence of their potential efficacy, and to approve or refute their potential anti-aging benefits.","PROJECT NARRATIVE:RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH
Cocoa products have become a widely consumed food, with growing demand and increasing interest in its
anti-aging biology. While the popularity of cocoa consumption remains steady, enthusiasm has outpaced
the scientific evidence in humans. Thus, we propose to leverage the large-scale ongoing national
randomized clinical trial called COSMOS to evaluate the effect of cocoa supplementation on longitudinal
change in biological aging including epigenetic aging and inflammation aging in relation to cardiovascular
disease (CVD). Parallel assessments of the randomized multivitamin intervention on the same biological
aging and CVD outcomes will be also performed, as multivitamins have remained the most common
dietary supplement, taken by at least one-third of US adults. Thus, this study will not only provide valuable

Elevated circulating levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), increased serum phosphate, and anemia are
associated with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), cardiovascular disease (CVD), and chronic kidney disease
(CKD) progression in children. Current treatment strategies for CKD-mineral bone disorder and CKD-related
anemia include 1,25D, binders, iron, and erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESA). However, 1,25D therapy
further increases circulating and bone FGF23 levels, and iron deficiency and ESA treatment both also
stimulate FGF23 production. A novel paradigm in earlier CKD has been suggested with the use of phosphate
binders with or without an inhibitor of enteral phosphate absorption, when serum phosphate levels are
within the normal range, to lower FGF23 and to raise endogenous 1,25D levels. However, such approach led
to inconsistent results. Therapy with ferric citrate (FC), on the other hand, has been shown consistently to
lower FGF23 and phosphate levels while improving indices of iron metabolism in adults with CKD stages 3-4.
Furthermore, FC decreased serum phosphate levels, improved iron parameters and was well tolerated in
pediatric dialysis patients. Thus, FC may have added value especially for children with pre-dialysis CKD in
whom iron deficiency anemia and elevated FGF23 levels are highly prevalent. Moreover, iron deficiency is a
potent driver of FGF23 production. Therefore, we hypothesize that treatment with FC will lower intact FGF23
levels during a 12-month period in a randomized, double-blinded, two -arms parallel study in 160 pediatric
patients with CKD stages 3-4 and normal serum phosphate levels. The multi-site trial will pursue the following
specific aims: Specific Aim 1: To determine the efficacy of FC to lower serum intact FGF23 levels (primary
endpoint) in pediatric patients with CKD 3–4 over 12 months. Specific Aim 2: To determine the effects of the
interventions on anemia, kidney function, and indices of bone and mineral metabolism (secondary end-points).
Additionally, we will perform pre- and post-treatment bone biopsies to assess bone histomorphometry and
FGF23 expression in a sub-cohort of 24 UCLA patients. Specific Aim 3: To determine the safety and
tolerability of FC in pediatric CKD 3-4 patients. If our hypothesis is confirmed, then a new treatment paradigm
would emerge in which therapy with FC will be initiated early in CKD, when patients are normophosphatemic,
slowing progressive increases in FGF23 and blunting FGF23-associated adverse renal and CVD.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) levels are elevated in early stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in
children and they are associated with CKD progression and cardiovascular disease. Thus, strategies that lower
or limit the rise of FGF23 may lead to a new paradigm for the treatment of CKD-Mineral Bone Disorder. Thus,
early intervention that focuses on control of FGF23 may lead to correcting 1,25D deficiency with replacement
therapy that is associated with further rise in FGF23 levels.",

The beneficial infant outcomes of maternal vitamin C supplementation (500 mg/day) in pregnant smokers is
supported by our robust pre-trial evidence in animal models and convincing human pilot data. This evidence
served as the basis for our current multi-center double blind randomized trial “Vitamin C to Decrease Effects of
Smoking in Pregnancy on Infant Lung Function” (VCSIP; NCT01723696). Recruitment is completed as
scheduled with 252 pregnant smokers randomized to vitamin C or placebo. VCSIP's primary and secondary
outcomes, respectively, are pulmonary function testing (PFT) of infants at 3 months of age, and PFTs and the
incidence of wheeze at 12 months of age. This application is a renewal for the VCSIP trial to continue following
mothers and their offspring through 5 years of age. Time is critical, as the study population is predominantly
under-resourced making rapport crucial to cohort retention, which requires personnel and time.
The aim of this renewal proposal is to determine whether prenatal supplementation with vitamin C can improve
pulmonary function and decrease recurrent wheeze through 5 years of age in the offspring of smokers. Our
hypothesis is that supplemental vitamin C in pregnant smokers will significantly improve their children's
pulmonary function and decrease recurrent wheeze. This is a logical continuation for the VCSIP trial as
transient versus recurrent wheeze are not clinical distinguishable until 5 years of age. Following infants from
the VCSIP until age 5 years: will differentiate patients with transient versus recurrent wheeze (a more likely
predictor of asthma); will determine if early life protective effects of vitamin C are sustained to this older age;
and will provide structure for continued biologic samples from the children for future mechanistic studies of
vitamin C action. All investigators, clinical staff and participants will remain blinded to treatment allocation. We
are currently completing the primary outcome, and based on the number of randomized smokers we will have
a sufficient number of pulmonary function measurements at 3 months of age in the infants of randomized
smokers to meet the predetermined sample size for this analysis. The first infants of VCSIP turned 1 year old
in May 2014; therefore this proposal is being submitted now, prior to the analysis of the primary outcome of the
VCSIP study, to minimize gaps in the follow-up of this valuable cohort. The children will be followed with
quarterly respiratory questionnaires and yearly visits, collecting the following samples: maternal and child hair
for nicotine; child buccal swabs; maternal exhaled carbon monoxide; pulmonary function tests at 3, 4,and 5
years of age. This competitive renewal will allow us to study the longer term outcome of our intervention with
vitamin C with regards to childhood pulmonary function and the occurrence of recurrent wheeze through 5
years of age. It will also allow us to follow this unique, extensively phenotyped cohort of children born to
pregnant smokers to 5 years of age to address important scientific questions related to maternal smoking and
childhood respiratory health/wheeze/asthma.","Project Narrative
Maternal smoking during pregnancy is the largest preventable cause of childhood respiratory illness, and
children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy show lifetime decreases in pulmonary function and
increased respiratory illnesses and asthma. Sadly, more than 50% of smokers who become pregnant continue
to smoke and approximately 20% of expenditures for childhood respiratory illness are caused by maternal
smoking amounting to over $1 billion annually in current health care dollars. The findings from this project will
support the addition of daily vitamin C supplementation to pregnant smokers, a simple, safe, and inexpensive
adjunct to current smoking cessation counseling that would significantly decrease the impact of smoking during
pregnancy on child respiratory health both in the United States and world-wide.",

Since 2009, the South Carolina Clinical and Translational Research Institute (SCTR) has transformed the
research environment across South Carolina (SC) by creating a Learning Health System that supports high-
quality clinical and translational research (CTR) and fosters collaboration and innovation. Headquartered at the
Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC), SCTR has engaged stakeholders and created statewide
partnerships to improve care and address social determinants of health across SC. However, greater than 75%
of SC is rural, and all 46 counties contain areas designated as medically underserved, so health disparities
remain an issue. Over the next five years, SCTR will strengthen its outreach to these medically underserved
areas through collaboration with the Clemson University Health Extension Program and the MUSC Telehealth
Center of Excellence. With a focus on implementation and dissemination as well as discovery, we will develop
and demonstrate innovative technologies and outreach to improve the health of our stakeholders. We will build
on prior successes and introduce innovative approaches to expand CTR across SC through the following aims:
Aim 1. Extend and enhance high-quality, innovative, flexible curricula and training experiences for all levels of
the CTR workforce, with particular emphasis on enhancing workforce heterogeneity and team science.
Aim 2. Engage a diverse group of stakeholders as active partners in CTR to address health care priorities while
enhancing the scientific knowledge base about collaboration and engagement.
Aim 3. Promote greater inclusion across the full translational spectrum of research by engaging investigators
from many disciplines and patient populations from diverse demographic backgrounds and geographic areas.
Aim 4. Develop, demonstrate and disseminate innovative methods and processes to address barriers and
accelerate the translation of research discoveries to improvements in human health that can be generalized to
a variety of practice settings.
Aim 5. Enhance the conduct of translational research through the development of secure and innovative
informatics and digital health solutions, tools and methodologies that affect every aspect of CTR.
SCTR’s vision is to be a major force in facilitating the translation of innovative science into practice to address
the health priorities of the citizens of SC and beyond. To achieve this vision, SCTR’s mission is to catalyze the
development of methods and technologies that lead to more efficient translation of biomedical discoveries into
interventions that improve individual and public health. SCTR will serve as the statewide academic home for
CTR, one that is well-integrated with SC’s healthcare systems and provides essential support for innovative,
efficient, multidisciplinary research and research training. We will work within SCTR, with our partners across
SC and with the CTSA Consortium to realize this vision.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

ITM 2.0: ADVANCING TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE IN METROPOLITAN CHICAGO
The University of Chicago (UChicago) Institute for Translational Medicine (ITM) was created in 2007 to
assemble, integrate, and create the intellectual, administrative, and physical resources required to catalyze
research and research training in Clinical and Translational Science. We have trained university scientists and
health care providers to work together with stakeholders in all concerned communities to determine the
molecular, genetic, pathophysiologic, and social determinants of disease; to develop and test interventions
directed toward those mechanisms; and to achieve these goals in a way that is rigorous, efficient, ethical,
respectful of, and responsive to our community’s needs and values. In its first 9 years, the ITM has capitalized
on outstanding intellectual and physical resources throughout UChicago and at ITM affiliate institutions – Rush
University Medical Center (Rush), NorthShore University HealthSystem (NorthShore), and Illinois Institute of
Technology (IIT) – to build the infrastructure for a transformative, energized, and self-improving home for
clinical and translational research. Now, we pursue a bold guiding vision for “ITM 2.0” – that health outcomes
will be improved throughout Chicagoland by mitigating disease risk, morbidity and mortality through
collaborative, multidisciplinary team science. We will work toward this vision by assembling scientific,
institutional, and community stakeholders, and together focusing on the highest value propositions to improve
mutually defined health concerns, leveraging synergies that accelerate progress across the translational
spectrum. Our core conviction is that participating in health research is a matter of shared self-interest and
social justice, a “new normal” prevailing viewpoint toward which we will strive together over the next 20 years.
ITM 2.0 will work hand-in-hand with health stakeholders throughout Chicagoland and throughout the nation,
conceptualizing, developing and deploying innovative processes and practices to achieve our common goal.
Preparing for this ambitious challenge, we broadened the scope of institutional and community stakeholders.
Rush now joins UChicago as an ITM lead institution, and Loyola University Medical Center and Advocate
Health Care join as ITM affiliates. We partner with esteemed institutions – the Chicago Community Trust, the
Illinois Biotechnology Industry Organization, and the Chicago and Illinois Departments of Public Health – and
inclusively leverage strong collaborations with the other two Chicago CTSAs, with the Chicago-wide PCORnet
CDRN CAPriCORN, and with the recently awarded Illinois Precision Medicine Consortium. In ITM 2.0, we will
together develop innovative and sometimes disruptive approaches to advance the science and practice of
clinical and translational research by rigorously determining which approaches work and then disseminating
the results of both successes and failures. We expect that this approach will improve the conduct of and
training for clinical and translational research for the benefit of Chicago, the CTSA Consortium, and the nation.","RELEVANCE

The human diet can positively or negatively impact cancer incidence, with plant-derived compounds – such as
polyphenols – often exhibiting antioxidant cancer-preventive properties. Walnuts are an exceptional source of
polyphenolic ellagitannins (ETs) that are converted to ellagic acid and various urolithins by gut microbiota in the
colon. Urolithin A (UroA) is of particular interest for its potent anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, and prebiotic
activities. However, UroA production in individuals can vary significantly, likely based on differences in gut
microbiota. We will substantiate the anti-cancer benefits of a prebiotic/probiotic complex derived from consuming
walnuts and determine the basis of human inter-individual variability in UroA formation.
 Our overall hypothesis is that walnut supplementation improves colonic health and lowers colorectal cancer
(CRC) risk through UroA formation. This leads to several working hypotheses guiding our Aims: Working
Hypothesis 1. UroA producers are at a lower risk of having an advanced colonic lesion; Working Hypothesis 2.
Walnut supplementation will increase urinary UroA levels; and Working Hypothesis 3. CRC prevention by
walnuts will be greater in UroA-producers than in non-producers. In Aim 1, we propose a randomized, controlled
crossover trial in 69 patients (45-75 y) to examine walnut effects on CRC risk factors. We will associate an
individual's ability to produce UroA with biomarkers of inflammation and CRC risk, and identify the bacterial
species responsible for urolithin metabolism. In Aim 2, we will investigate prebiotic effects of ET-containing
walnuts in two conditional mouse CRC models, focusing on important processes in CRC and inflammation,
including bile acid metabolism, inflammation, and short chain fatty acid production. In Aim 3, we will test the
probiotic effects of human UroA-producing microbiota in a mouse fecal microbiota transplant (MT) study and
demonstrate a causal role for specific microbes in UroA formation. This will enable us to validate the concept that
important protective effects of walnuts and other ET-rich foods occur through specific microbiota-derived
metabolites. This will also define biomarkers and probiotics that highlight the benefits of these foods. Our
approach incorporates personalized nutrition with a focus on UroA producers and non-producers in colonic
health. Ultimately, our human and pre-clinical mouse studies may lead to prebiotics and probiotics that increase
protective urolithins for CRC prevention. These highly significant studies will test the ability of the microbiota to
generate colonic mucosa-protective agents (e.g., UroA). It is possible that high-risk patients can be efficiently
converted to a protective state by taking probiotics to realize the full benefits of ET-rich foods.","NARRATIVE

impairment (MCI) and progresses to Alzheimer's disease, underlying mechanisms are poorly understood, and
interventions limited. Published evidence links MCI to elevated oxidative stress caused by increased levels of
reactive oxygen species (ROS). To defend against the damaging potential of ROS (which causes oxidative
stress, OxS), cells normally depend on antioxidants, and Glutathione (GSH) is the main component of human
endogenous intracellular antioxidant defenses. GSH is a tripeptide composed of three amino-acids, cysteine,
glycine and glutamic acid. Since elderly humans are known to have an increased risk of developing elevated
OxS and GSH deficiency, we investigated and reported that intracellular GSH deficiency in elderly humans
occurs primarily due to intracellular deficiency of two of its precursor amino-acids cysteine and glycine, but not
glutamic acid, and that these GSH-deficient elderly humans had elevated ROS levels indicating elevated OxS.
Supplementing cysteine (as n-acetylcysteine) plus glycine orally as capsules for 2-weeks replenished their own
intracellular concentrations, improved intracellular GSH synthesis, restored intracellular GSH levels and
lowered ROS/OxS to levels seen in younger humans. GSH is also a key component of mitochondrial
antioxidant defenses, and GSH depletion induces mitochondrial dysfunction with elevated ROS levels,
neuronal injury and apoptosis. We studied and reported that mitochondrial dysfunction and OxS in aging
(elderly humans and aged mice) can be improved by correcting GSH deficiency. These findings have
implications for MCI in elderly humans. In a small ongoing open-label pilot study investigating the long-term
safety and impact of supplementing cysteine and glycine on mitochondrial function, OxS and cognitive
function (NCT02348762), we found significant improvements in memory, language and executive
function at 4w, 12w and 24w after starting cysteine plus glycine supplementation, and these
benefits appear to recede 12w after stopping these supplements. These preliminary data support the
exciting possibility that cysteine plus glycine supplementation in elderly humans could improve MCI by
improving GSH concentrations, mitochondrial function, and/or improving vascular/endothelial function, and
by lowering OxS. The goals of this pilot trial are to (a) establish the relationship in older humans between
MCI, GSH deficiency, impaired mitochondrial fuel oxidation and elevated OxS, and (b) determine proof-of-
concept of whether supplementing cysteine plus glycine to correct these defects improves MCI in aging.","Elderly humans have an increased risk of dementia which begins as mild defects in memory called mild
cognitive impairment – we do not know why this happens and there is no effective treatment. Our group found
that supplementing the diets of such elderly humans with protein building blocks called cysteine and glycine
improves their cognitive function, and when these supplements are stopped the benefits begin to decline. This
exploratory study will find out if this effect is real and identify factors responsible for cognitive impairment
(and improvement) by studying a bigger group of elderly humans with mild cognitive impairment who will be
evaluated 12 weeks after receiving either cysteine plus glycine or a placebo protein, and a further 12-weeks
after stopping these supplement proteins.",

nursing home (NH) residents. Thus, there is an urgent need for effective strategies to prevent PNA in elderly.
An important predisposing factor that may account for the higher incidence of PNA in older adults is the age-
associated decline in T cell function. Importantly, there are remarkable similarities between Zn deficiency and
age-induced changes in T cells. We have shown that 29% of NH residents have low serum Zn levels, which
was associated with higher incidence and duration of PNA, and antibiotic use. Although our preliminary data
strongly suggest that low serum Zn is an independent risk factor for PNA in the elderly, a controlled clinical trial
is critically needed to determine the efficacy of Zn supplementation in PNA prevention in this population. The
objective of the larger clinical trial that will pursue the studies proposed in this R34 is to determine the effects of
Zn supplementation on PNA outcomes in NH elderly and to understand their mechanistic basis. Our central
hypothesis is that improving Zn status in NH elderly with low serum Zn will reduce the incidence and duration
of PNA, and the frequency of antibiotic use, and that the effect of Zn is mediated mainly through the
improvement of T cell function and/or innate immunity. Our rationale for conducting the proposed clinical trial is
to determine the value of Zn supplementation as an inexpensive, easily implemented intervention that would
aid in the prevention of PNA in the elderly.
 In our previous study NH elderly with low serum Zn levels, who were supplemented with 30 mg/d of Zn and
½ RDA of essential micronutrients showed, on average, significantly improved serum Zn levels. However, only
58% of participant became serum Zn adequate. We therefore hypothesize that either a higher dose or a longer
duration of supplementation is required to achieve adequate serum Zn levels in all Zn deficient elderly. Our
rationale for conducting the proposed pilot study is to determine the most effective yet safe dose for Zn
supplementation in NH residents to be used in the larger clinical trial described above.
The Specific Aim of the proposed two-year, pilot study is to establish the optimal dose of supplemental Zn to
achieve adequate Zn status, and improved T cell function in Zn deficient elderly. We will accomplish this goal
by conducting a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial to test the efficacy of
supplementation with 30 or 60 mg/d of Zn for 12 months on serum and immune cell Zn levels, key measures of
T cell mediated and innate immunity, and adverse events. The findings of this proposal are scientifically
essential, yet sufficient, to allow us to make definitive decisions that inform the final design of our planned
clinical trial, which aims to establish the value of Zn supplementation as an inexpensive, easily implemented
intervention that would aid in the prevention of PNA, limit the duration of PNA, and consequently reduce the
need for antimicrobial therapy in the elderly.","Project Narrative
Pneumonia is a major public health problem for the elderly and is one of the leading causes of hospitalization
and death for this population, particularly for elderly nursing home residents. This planning grants seeks to
establish a safe and effective dose of zinc supplementation with the goal to conduct a larger randomized
clinical trial to study the effect of zinc supplementation in nursing home elderly with low serum zinc levels on
the risk, antibiotic use, and duration of sick days with pneumonia. This project has significant potential to
positively impact the health and quality of life in the elderly and to reduce the economic costs associated with
their care.",

have previously performed an intervention study using L. johnsonii N6.2 in rodents and found that the

 Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common and devastating complication of critical
illness, and effective therapies to prevent ARDS are limited. Vitamin D metabolites have potent
immunomodulatory effects and attenuate acute organ injury in animal models. Randomized controlled trials
(RCTs) are ongoing to test whether vitamin D3 (vit D3) administration improves outcomes in critically ill patients
at risk of ARDS. However, due to the heterogeneous nature of critical illness, patient-specific factors likely play
a major role in determining response to vit D3. We will use a precision medicine approach to investigate the
clinical, genetic, and biochemical factors that determine response to vit D3 administration in critical illness.
 This proposal is an ancillary study to the NHLBI-funded Vitamin D to Improve Outcomes by Leveraging
Early Treatment (VIOLET) trial, an ongoing, multicenter RCT that is enrolling 3000 critically ill patients at high
risk of ARDS and death. Patients are randomly assigned to receive a single enteral dose of 540,000 I.U. of vit
D3 or placebo to test whether vit D3 reduces 90-day mortality and acute organ injury. VIOLET is archiving
plasma and DNA from all 3000 patients on day 0, and plasma on day 3 from the first 300 patients. We
propose to collect plasma on day 3 from an additional 500 patients (Aim 1) and to leverage existing samples
(Aims 2 and 3) to test the following hypotheses.
 In Aim 1 we will use paired plasma samples (n=400) from days 0 and 3 to investigate the clinical factors
that affect the pharmacokinetic response to vit D3 administration in critical illness. We will test whether greater
severity-of-illness (higher SOFA score), obesity, and acute or chronic liver or kidney disease attenuate
increases in plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25D) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D) levels from day 0 to 3 in
patients who receive vit D3. In Aim 2 we will investigate whether pre-specified common polymorphisms in
genes affecting vitamin D metabolism or in vitamin D target genes identify a patient population more likely to
benefit from vit D3 administration, assessed by 90-day mortality (primary endpoint) and acute organ injury
(secondary endpoint). In Aim 3, we will investigate whether lower plasma levels of fibroblast growth factor-23,
an osteocyte-derived hormone that inhibits the conversion of 25D to 1,25D, identify a patient population more
likely to benefit from vit D3 administration, assessed by 90-day mortality (primary endpoint) and acute organ
injury (secondary endpoint).
 Development of a precision medicine approach to vit D3 administration in critical illness could have

Osteoporosis is the most common bone disease; 53.6 million Americans have a reduced bone mass, which
increases their risk of fragility fractures. In addition to the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, recent
studies show that approximately 60% of older men and 40% of older women have inadequate vitamin K
intakes. Growing evidence indicates that there are important interrelationships between vitamin D and vitamin
K on bone. Vitamin D increases intestinal calcium absorption and stimulates production of two proteins,
osteocalcin and matrix Gla protein. Vitamin K plays an essential role in activating these proteins so that
osteocalcin incorporates calcium in bone and matrix Gla protein inhibits calcification in soft tissues, including
the kidney. Both vitamins D and K are important for optimal function of these proteins. Although vitamin D
supplements are widely used to improve bone health, trials of supplemental vitamin D alone in reducing
fractures showed inconsistent results. Emerging evidence indicates that supplemental D in the context of low
vitamin K status is less effective on bone health measures. Therefore, low vitamin K status may account for
some of the inconsistencies of trials testing vitamin D and bone health and may contribute to toxicities
attributed to high-dose vitamin D such as kidney stones. No previous randomized controlled trials have been
adequately powered to test effects of vitamin K status on fracture risk or the interaction of vitamin K status with
high-dose, supplemental vitamin D on bone. To fill knowledge gaps, we propose an innovative, ancillary study
to the large, NIH-sponsored, VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL). VITAL is testing effects of supplemental
vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol, 2000 IU/d), and/or omega-3 fatty acids (fish oil, 1 g/d) in the primary prevention of
cancer and cardiovascular disease in 25,871 U.S. men (aged ≥50) and women (aged ≥55), including 5,106
African Americans. In this competitive renewal application of “VITAL: Effects on Bone Structure and
Architecture,” we will determine whether low vitamin K status, assessed by 3 sensitive biomarkers, modifies
effects of supplemental vitamin D on fractures, bone mineral density (BMD) and structure, and secondarily on
increases in urine calcium excretion, a risk factor for low BMD and kidney stones. During the first cycle of this
grant, we surpassed recruitment goals and collected baseline and 2-yr post-randomization imaging studies for
bone density, structure and architecture that will be used in the proposed studies (n=771). In addition, other
key VITAL resources will be leveraged including: 16,953 baseline and 6,000 follow-up blood samples;
measures of vitamin D, calcium, creatinine and parathyroid hormone; and adjudicated fractures and kidney
stones. This proposal provides a unique opportunity to clarify in the largest study of supplemental vitamin D,
the interdependencies of vitamins D and K and their roles on fractures, bone health measures, and urine
calcium excretion. Findings from the proposed ancillary study will be critical to the interpretation of on-going
vitamin D trials and provide new insights to advance clinical care and public health recommendations.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Vitamin D supplements are widely promoted for bone health. Both vitamin D and vitamin K are important for

Indolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas are incurable diseases, and require intermittent and often
morbid and expensive therapy during their prolonged natural history. Lower intensity and
better-tolerated, cost-effective treatment strategies are needed for these patients. Low vitamin
D levels at diagnosis of indolent lymphomas are strongly associated with inferior outcomes to
treatment. Standard therapy for low tumor burden, indolent lymphoma includes a single agent
monoclonal antibody (rituximab). In this proposal, we will complete a double-blind, placebo-
controlled randomized trial evaluating if vitamin D supplementation with 2000IU oral tablets daily
for three years improves the progression-free survival of patients with indolent lymphoma
treated with single agent rituximab. Stratification factors for randomization will include histology
and FL-IPI prognostic score. The primary endpoint of the trial is progression-free survival over
three years; secondary endpoints include response at 13 weeks, and overall survival. Planned
subset analyses include follicular lymphoma histology and female sex. With 210 randomized
patients, we will have 80% power to detect a HR = 0.55 at a two sided alpha = 0.05 level of
significance. This clinical trial will be coordinated at the University of Rochester Wilmot Cancer
Institute, and six expert lymphoma centers from the Lymphoma Epidemiology of Outcomes

specific genotypes of the Vitamin D receptor (VDR) and vitamin D binding protein (DPB), we will
utilize whole exome sequencing to determine whether vitamin D-related germline variations are
critical determinants of outcome in the context of vitamin D supplementation of patients with

Significant Public Health efforts have been made towards salt reduction but most have met with failure. Dietary
factors such high sodium/low potassium diets contribute to the development of cardiovascular diseases
(CVDs) such as atherosclerosis and high blood pressure (BP). This is important as CVD is the number one
killer in the U.S. While the role of these two nutrients on BP is widely accepted, their impact on the vasculature
has received less attention. Endothelial dysfunction, characterized by impaired dilation, is an important non-
traditional risk factor for atherosclerosis. We have shown that high sodium diets cause endothelial dysfunction,
independent of changes in BP (accomplished by testing adults with salt resistant BP). Evidence supporting
potassium's beneficial role on vascular health remains unclear although it may be more effective in the
presence of a high sodium diet. A purported mechanism responsible for sodium-induced vascular dysfunction
is overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulting in reduced nitric oxide (NO)
production/bioavailability. It has been suggested that potassium can counteract sodium's effects by reducing
ROS. Additionally, high sodium diets have been shown to stiffen the endothelium by increasing abundance of
the endothelial sodium channel (EnNaC) while potassium's role on EnNaC is unknown. Our central hypothesis
is that dietary potassium will protect the vasculature from sodium's harmful effect by preserving NO and
reducing oxidative stress and endothelial cell stiffness. We will use three 10-day diets to test our hypothesis
(controlled feeding study, crossover design, diet order sequence randomized with washout between diets). We
will compare a moderate potassium/high sodium diet (MK/HS; 65 mmol/300 mmol) to a high potassium/high
sodium (HK/HS;120 mmol/300 mmol) to assess potassium's protective effect on the vasculature during a fixed
sodium intake. We will also compare a moderate potassium/low sodium (MK/LS; 65 mmol/50 mmol) diet to the
MK/HS diet to individually confirm salt resistant BP status. Focusing on salt resistant adults allows us to isolate
the vascular effects, without the confound of changes in BP (i.e., independent of BP). Rigor will be enhanced
by utilizing twenty-four hour ambulatory BP and urine collections during each diet condition; men, women, and
minorities will be tested. Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation will be used to assess conduit endothelial-
dependent dilation. Cutaneous vasodilation in response to local heating using laser Doppler flowmetry coupled
with intradermal microdialysis will be used to assess microvascular function. Venous endothelial cells will be
collected for direct assessment of cell stiffness by atomic force microscopy and markers of oxidative stress.
We expect to demonstrate that dietary potassium protects the endothelium from the deleterious effects of high
sodium by reducing oxidative stress and endothelial cell stiffness and preserving NO. These studies are novel
in that they will be the first to comprehensively evaluate the role of dietary potassium on vascular function
independent of BP.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
The proposed research is relevant to public health because sodium intake continues to remain high and has
been shown to have deleterious effects on the vasculature independent of blood pressure. In contrast, dietary
potassium is known for its blood pressure lowering effects yet its role on the vasculature remains understudied.
Upon conclusion of this study, we will likely demonstrate that potassium blunts the deleterious effects of high
sodium on the vasculature, independent of blood pressure.",

Despite prophylactic immune suppression, clinically significant (Grade II–IV) acute graft-versus-host disease
(aGvHD) afflicts up to 45% of pediatric patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation
(alloHCT). As aGvHD is responsible for nearly 20% of deaths following alloHCT, the need for better prevention
and therapy for aGvHD is readily apparent. Involvement of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract in the pathogenesis
of aGvHD has been substantiated by the translation of pre-clinical and clinical studies. Emerging evidence
suggests that perturbations in the microbiota diversity result in aberrant systemic immune response as well as
pathogen colonization and mucosal invasion, fostering the development of GvHD. Pre-clinical studies also
suggest that replenishing commensals like Lactobacillus prior to HCT substantially decrease GvHD severity
and intestinal insult. Our pilot data suggest that probiotics are safe to administer prior to and during children
and adolescents undergoing HCT (IND#108,977). This proposal is a double-blind, randomized, multi-center
intervention trial to evaluate the specific effect of probiotics in preventing GI aGvHD and more generally the
effects on overall GvHD severity. The proposal is an approved concept of Children’s Oncology Group’s (COG),
a NCI National Clinical Trial Network group. The study will be conducted through COG using its clinical
research infrastructure. Correlative laboratory studies (plasma and stool analysis) will be performed in order to
elucidate the mechanisms of action of probiotic therapy. The probiotic, Lactobacillus plantarum (LBP), or
placebo will be administered to 384 evaluable children and adolescents undergoing alloHCT for hematologic
malignancy beginning with the initiation of conditioning through Day 56. We hypothesize that maintaining
epithelial cell integrity through the administration of probiotic therapy will lead to restoring microbial diversity,
which will preserve immune tolerance and prevent aGvHD. The primary study aim is to determine efficacy of
orally-administered LBP in preventing the development of GI aGvHD in children and adolescents undergoing
alloHCT for the treatment of cancer. Secondary study aims are: (1) To determine whether orally-administered
LBP decreases the incidence of Grade II–IV aGvHD following alloHCT; (2) To determine whether LBP
administration maintains intestinal integrity as measured by mean plasma citrulline levels and reduction in
mucosal barrier injury (MBI) bacteremia; (3a) To measure the effects of LBP on the intestinal flora phylogenetic
composition during and after alloHCT using 16S rRNA gene deep sequencing; (3b) To measure effects of LBP
on intestinal flora function during and after alloHCT using metagenomic and metabolite profiling; and (4) To
measure proposed immunomodulatory effects of LBP in mean plasma levels of alloreactive-induced
inflammatory cytokines (IL-2, IL-6, IL-12p70, IFNγ, and TNFα) in patients receiving LBP compared to placebo.
The proposed study will be the first double-blind randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of
probiotics in preventing GI aGvHD in pediatric HCT. If a beneficial effect is observed, expansion of the
proposed intervention to other pediatric and adult malignant conditions requiring alloHCT may improve overall
quality of life and prevent transplant-related complications like aGvHD.","Project Narrative
The proposed study is a randomized, controlled intervention trial to determine the benefit of probiotic therapy in
preventing the development of gastrointestinal acute graft versus host disease in children undergoing
allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation for a hematologic malignancy. Importantly, correlative studies will

 This proposal details a 5-year training plan to prepare the physician candidate, Thao (Tina) Ho, for a career as
an independent, translational investigator who will become a leader in the field of iron deficiency and anemia of
prematurity. The project will identify the effects of enteral iron supplementation, as prevention for anemia, on
intestinal health of preterm infants through complementary clinical and basic science studies.
 All preterm infants are at risk for iron deficiency. Enteral iron supplementation is recommended to all preterm
infants at 2-4 mg/kg/day; however, they are often given at higher doses, 6-10 mg/kg/day. Emerging evidence
suggest that enteral iron can exacerbate the overgrowth of enteric pathogens and suppress beneficial bacteria.
This imbalance, or intestinal dysbiosis, intestinal inflammation, and disrupted barrier are observed in necrotizing
enterocolitis, a devastating intestinal disease of prematurity. Preterm infants are colonized with higher
percentage of enteric pathogens at baseline compared to term infants. Dr. Ho’s preliminary data has led to the
hypothesis that high enteral iron supplementation exacerbates intestinal dysbiosis, mucosal
inflammation and permeability in preterm infants. Dr. Ho will test this hypothesis by conducting a randomized
study to compare the fecal bacterial composition, mucosal inflammation and barrier function between premature
infants given high vs. low iron regimens and investigating the cellular mechanisms with cytokine production and
gene expression using human 3D enteroid models. At the completion of this project, Dr. Ho will be experienced
in 1) designing and conducting clinical studies, 2) advanced biostatistical analyses and interpreting the results
of large clinical datasets, and 3) performing experiments on 3D cell models.
 The candidate’s independent analytical thinking will grow with regular discussions among NIH-funded
researchers and didactics provided by the University of South Florida. This award will allow her more protected
time to develop necessary skills and collaboration to establish independence by the 4-5th year. Dr. Ho will work
under the primary mentorship of Dr. Groer, an expert in translational microbiome and infant health research with
many successful mentees. To complement her primary mentor, Dr. Ho’s mentoring team, Drs. Adams and Kim,
will support her in cell culture techniques, microbiology, and genomics. Dr. Ho also has established a superb
team of scientific advisors with the following expertise: Dr. Michael Georgieff (iron and neurodevelopment), Dr.
Josef Neu (intestinal immunology), Dr. Sharon Donovan (childhood nutrition and intestinal microbiome), and Dr.
Jason Spence (3D intestinal models). They have committed their time to her career development and research
goals long before this application. Their mentorships, the fast-growing and supportive research environment at
USF, the innovative research strategy, and a focused career development plan will provide a strong platform for
Dr. Ho to secure an R01 to investigate the long-term health effects from different iron doses to optimize the
prevention of iron deficiency and anemia of prematurity.","Iron deficiency is the most common single nutrient deficiency in the world and all preterm infants

Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on
the host. One of the most common indications for probiotic treatment is the prevention of antibiotic-associated
diarrhea (AAD). Unfortunately, the efficacy of many probiotic products used for AAD is not supported by
rigorous independent research, and non-evidence-based clinical usage is common. Data from several studies
suggest antibiotic-induced disruption of commensal colonic bacteria results in a significant reduction in short
chain fatty acid (SCFA) production and a concomitant reduction in Na-dependent fluid absorption, ultimately
resulting in AAD. The probiotic strain Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 (BB-12) has been shown to
ameliorate a variety of gastrointestinal disease states and is known to produce acetate – the most abundant
primary colonic SCFA – at concentrations of up to 50 mM in vitro. Thus, we hypothesize that the concurrent
administration of BB-12 with antibiotics will protect against the development of AAD by the ability of BB-12 to
both generate acetate directly, and increase other SCFAs through cross-feeding of certain bacteria in the
Firmicutes phylum. For example, Clostridium, Eubacterium and Roseburia use acetate to produce butyrate,
another common SCFA. The primary aim of the R61 phase (N=60) is to determine if BB-12 can mitigate
antibiotic-induced reduction in SCFA concentration, as reflected in fecal acetate levels. We hypothesize that
antibiotics will decrease fecal SCFAs, but BB-12 supplementation will protect against antibiotic-induced SCFA
reduction, and/or be associated with quicker restoration to baseline SCFA levels as compared to control.
Antibiotic administration also lowers total microbial counts and diversity in the gut microbiota, disrupting the
homeostasis of the gut ecosystem and allowing colonization by pathogens. The secondary aim uses 16S rDNA
profiling to determine if BB-12 inhibits antibiotic-induced disruption of the gut microbiota. We hypothesize that
antibiotics will diminish the overall number and diversity of bacterial species present in the fecal microbiota,
and concurrent BB-12 supplementation will minimize antibiotic-induced shifts in the microbiota, and/or will be
associated with shorter recovery to baseline microbiota composition as compared to control. In the R33 phase
(N=108), to further delineate the effects of BB-12 administration on the antibiotic-depleted gut microbiota, we
will evaluate the timing of probiotic administration in four randomly assigned groups: 1) BB-12 yogurt
consumed at the same time as the antibiotic; 2) control yogurt consumed at the same time as the antibiotic; 3)
BB-12 yogurt consumed four hours after the antibiotic; and 4) control yogurt consumed four hours after the
antibiotic. Our long-term goal is to determine the impact of BB-12 on a variety of gastrointestinal disease states
and ages. Elucidation of the mechanism(s) of action will be integral in shaping the direction of future
translational research on probiotic effectiveness.","Project Narrative
Probiotics are commonly used to address gastrointestinal issues, such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea. While

Food fortification with folic acid (FA), a synthetic inactive form of folate more stable than the natural form in food (5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5mTHF)), is mandated by law in 87 countries, including the US. People vary in their ability to metabolize FA to 5mTHF, resulting in unmetabolized FA (UMFA), which is present in serum of >95% of the US population. While adequate folate intake is essential for human health, the widespread presence of UMFA in serum has raised questions regarding potential unanticipated adverse effects. Expert panels systematically reviewing the safety of high FA intake concluded there is strong evidence on the benefits of FA, e.g. for neural tube defect prevention, but uncertainty for non-NTD outcomes. Many feel that there is a critical need to identify alterations in metabolites and metabolic pathways associated with high FA intake. The metabolome offers a robust approach to do so as it integrates meaningful changes in a broad spectrum of key regulatory processes. The goal of this proposal is to leverage a wealth of data and banked samples from a recently completed randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (RCT) of FA supplementation (FACT, n=610) in Bangladesh. Unlike the US, Bangladesh is a FA-naïve population, as foods are not fortified with FA. We propose to incorporate new studies that will use novel high-resolution metabolomics (HRM). Untargeted metabolomics is the quantitative measurement of small-molecule metabolites that captures an unbiased snap-shot of the activity of all metabolically active organ systems involved in the development of almost all metabolic disorders. The FACT study design includes supplementation with FA (400 or 800 µg/d x 12 or 24 weeks), and a “wash-out” period following FA cessation. This study design permits us to identify and validate novel metabolites and pathways altered by FA supplementation (Aim 1) and UMFA (Aim 2) and to determine the stability or reversibility of those effects over time. In collaboration with Dr. Walker, leader of the high-resolution metabolomics facility at Mt. Sinai, we will combine FACT’s rigorous RCT approach – the gold standard design to determine causality – with HRM that interrogates greater than 80% of metabolic pathways. We will test the hypotheses that FA supplementation and/or UMFA influence unanticipated downstream metabolites and pathways, and identify those that may be linked to health outcomes. In Aim 3, in collaboration with geneticist, Dr. Pierce, we will evaluate how gene variants influence the effects of FA supplementation and UMFA on metabolomic outcomes. In Aim 4, with Dr. Kioumourtzoglou, we will use novel pattern recognition and hierarchical approaches to identify specific metabolic patterns that are impacted by FA supplementation and/or UMFA. The findings of this study may inform policy decisions regarding FA fortification programs and the forms and doses of folate sold in over-the-counter supplements and used in popular beverage products.","Folic acid (FA), used in 86 countries for food fortification, is a synthetic inactive form of folate, which is metabolized in variable amounts to the natural form in foods.

Expert panels systematically reviewing the safety of high FA intake concluded there is strong evidence on the benefits of FA, e.g. for neural tube defect prevention, but uncertainty for non-NTD outcomes. Many feel that there is a critical need to identify alterations in metabolites and metabolic pathways associated with high FA intake. The metabolome offers a robust approach to do so as it integrates meaningful changes in a broad spectrum of key regulatory processes. The goal of this proposal is to leverage a wealth of data and banked samples from a recently completed randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (RCT) of FA supplementation (FACT, n=610) in Bangladesh. Unlike the US, Bangladesh is a FA-naïve population, as foods are not fortified with FA. We propose to incorporate new studies that will use novel high-resolution metabolomics (HRM). Untargeted metabolomics is the quantitative measurement of small-molecule metabolites that captures an unbiased snap-shot of the activity of all metabolically active organ systems involved in the development of almost all metabolic disorders. The FACT study design includes supplementation with FA (400 or 800 µg/d x 12 or 24 weeks), and a “wash-out” period following FA cessation. This study design permits us to identify and validate novel metabolites and pathways altered by FA supplementation (Aim 1) and UMFA (Aim 2) and to determine the stability or reversibility of those effects over time. In collaboration with Dr. Walker, leader of the high-resolution metabolomics facility at Mt. Sinai, we will combine FACT’s rigorous RCT approach – the gold standard design to determine causality – with HRM that interrogates greater than 80% of metabolic pathways. We will test the hypotheses that FA supplementation and/or UMFA influence unanticipated downstream metabolites and pathways, and identify those that may be linked to health outcomes. In Aim 3, in collaboration with geneticist, Dr. Pierce, we will evaluate how gene variants influence the effects of FA supplementation and UMFA on metabolomic outcomes. In Aim 4, with Dr. Kioumourtzoglou, we will use novel pattern recognition and hierarchical approaches to identify specific metabolic patterns that are impacted by FA supplementation and/or UMFA. The findings of this study may inform policy decisions regarding FA fortification programs and the forms and doses of folate sold in over-the-counter supplements and used in popular beverage products.","Folic acid (FA), used in 86 countries for food fortification, is a synthetic inactive form of folate, which is metabolized in variable amounts to the natural form in foods. However, unmetabolized FA (UMFA) is almost universally present in serum of the U.S. population, and there are unanswered questions regarding its potential metabolic effects. The proposed studies will yield important new evidence to aid in our understanding of the metabolomic effects of FA and potential unanticipated effects of UMFA that may inform future policy decisions regarding food fortification, clinical supplement recommendations, and forms and doses of folate sold over-the- counter and used in popular beverage products.",

Abstract 
 Alaska Native (AN) children experience high rates of early rickets and vitamin D deficiency compared with 
other US populations. Pregnant AN women from Alaska`s Yukon Kuskokwim (YK) Delta have increased 
rates of vitamin D deficiency associated with transition from a traditional marine diet. Alaska Native 
children from the YK Delta experience one of the highest reported rates of early childhood caries (ECC). A 
Canadian study showed an association between low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels in prenatal 
women and ECC in their infants. We evaluated the association between YK Delta prenatal 25(OH)D 
levels and ECC in their children using data from the 'Maternal Organics Monitoring (MOM) Study”, and 
children's electronic dental records to assess ECC by decayed missing and filled teeth (dmft) scores. In 
the analysis, children 24-35 months of age with cord blood 25(OH)D <12 ng/ml had a mean dmft score 2.4 
times higher than non-deficient” children (p=0.003). There is limited information on the impact of prenatal 
supplementation improving vitamin D concentrations in pregnant women and no information on the impact 
on ECC. With available evidence, it is unclear whether vitamin D supplementation should be prescribed as 
part of routine antenatal care. Therefore, the current American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists 
recommends only the 400 IU of vitamin D in prenatal vitamins. Data in YK Delta women from the MOM 
study (2000-2010) showed 91% of 25(OH)D cord blood levels were <20ng/ml (insufficient), and 53% were 
<12ng/ml (deficient). In Fall 2015, YK Delta Regional Hospital (YKDRH) evaluated 25(OH)D in prenatal 
women – 60% were insufficient (<20ng/ml). In Fall 2016 YKDRH implemented guidelines to add 1000 IU 
of daily vitamin D to routinely recommended prenatal vitamins (400 IU) and calcium (200 IU). The recent 
Vitamin D supplementation guidelines in YK Delta offers an opportunity to evaluate the impact of prenatal 
supplementation on 25(OH)D concentrations and ECC. We propose a cohort study using the electronic 
health records and dental records to evaluate: 1) the effectiveness of prenatal vitamin D supplementation 
in increasing 25(OH)D concentrations to sufficient levels, 2) the association between deficient prenatal 
(25(OH)D concentrations and ECC, and 3) the impact of prenatal vitamin D supplementation on ECC. We 
will test the difference in 25(OH)D levels at first prenatal visit and third trimester in women before and after 
enhanced vitamin D supplementation, and measure factors associated with compliance. We will evaluate 
mean dmft scores between non-deficient and deficient Vitamin D groups, and before and after 
supplementation. and explore the relationship of covariates. This Information will help clinicians make 
decisions about prenatal vitamin D supplementation in YK Delta and other high risk populations.","No data",

The SWOG Statistical Center in Seattle, Washington, served as the coordinating center for two large prostate
cancer prevention trials: The Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) and the Prostate
Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT). SELECT was a Phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to
assess the effect of selenium and vitamin E, alone and in combination, primarily on prostate cancer incidence
and secondarily on other cancer incidence. SELECT randomized 35,533 men between 2001 and 2004. PCPT,
also a Phase III, double-blind trial, randomized 18,882 men to either finasteride or placebo between 1994 and
1997. Although schedules and requirements varied between the two studies, substantial serum, plasma, white
blood cells, and prostate tissue were collected on both, resulting in rich biorepositories.
Each had extensive prospective data collections which included diet and dietary supplements, quality of life,
physical activity, medications, other cancer diagnoses, cardiovascular endpoints, and treatment adverse events.
Although there have been significant scientific collaborations to date, there remain numerous opportunities to
further interrogate the clinical database and biobanks. Additionally, serum and plasma measures and extensive
genotyping data have already been obtained and are available for other investigators to use.
These cohorts are fully mature with 6,045 deaths and median follow-up of 18.4 years on PCPT and 3,762 deaths
and median follow-up of 10.1 years on SELECT. There have been 2,401 and 2,475 prostate cancers detected
during the trials plus an additional 890 and 338 prostate cancers identified via Medicare linkage in PCPT and
SELECT, respectively. Other primary cancers have also been documented either during the trials or through
data linkage. In addition to being able to extend the results of these well-conducted, randomized clinical trials
through linkages to Medicare, NDI and completed GWAS studies, these data can be used for epidemiologic
research as part of the ongoing consortium projects.
We request funds to continue to enrich the cohorts by collecting new data elements such as end point data from
Medicare and National Death Index linkages. We plan to update our linkages early in the upcoming grant period.
We also request support for the cohort team to develop detailed documentation and data sets to load into the
Cancer Epidemiology Data Repository, and we ask for continued support to provide a stable infrastructure for
the PCPT serum and PCPT and SELECT tissue repositories (all located at the University of Colorado). With
continued funding for the Statistical Center and some of our key scientific colleagues, we will be able to provide
administrative assistance and expertise to investigators who apply for additional funding to conduct studies using
our rich biologic repositories and clinical databases from PCPT and SELECT.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
By fully using the data and biologic samples from these two large cohorts with extensive follow-up, we will be
able to evaluate risk factors for prostate and other cancers, and subsequent prognosis. We will be able to
contribute clinical, demographic and biologic data, particularly genome wide measures, and we will provide
access to biologic specimens from men diagnosed with prostate and other cancers to researchers to better
understand the etiology of those cancers.",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Potent antiretroviral therapy has had an impressive impact on mortality in HIV-infected subjects, but this success came at the expense of significant co-morbidities, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. These co-morbidities have been linked to heightened inflammation and monocyte activation, but the etiology of this heightened activation/inflammation is not fully understood, but is partly due to gut epithelial barrier dysfunction and microbial translocation. Attempts at controlling inflammation, immune activation or microbial translocation in HIV+ treated subjects have been for the most part unsuccessful, and even treatment that have been successful (such as statins) have drug interactions and safety concerns, likely precluding their use in a large proportion of the HIV population. Safer strategies that could be more widely adopted are well needed. It has been estimated by the WHO that nearly two billion subjects may be zinc deficient in the developing countries. In the developed countries, prior to effective ART, zinc deficiency was prevalent in HIV-infected subjects, and had been independently linked to disease progression and to higher mortality. Unlike what is observed with most nutrients, the prevalence of zinc deficiency continues to be high, even in subjects on ART. For example, the Nutrition for Healthy Living study found that 38% of subjects on ART had zinc deficiency, and subjects in the upper quartiles of zinc levels had lower HIV-1 RNA levels than those in the lowest quartile. Thus far, there is a lack of data related to the contribution of zinc status to the heightened inflammation and monocyte activation in HIV. Also, the few available zinc-supplementation studies in HIV have been mostly in untreated or not optimally treated subjects, and no studies have assessed changes in inflammation markers after zinc supplementation in HIV+ subjects with virologic suppression on ART, a pertinent population to the current era of HIV infection where guidelines are calling for every HIV+ subject to be aggressively treated. In the R21 phase of the proposal, we will assess the prevalence of zinc deficiency in HIV-infected subjects on ART and compare it to that of a matched group of HIV negative controls. We will also study the relationships between zinc levels and systemic inflammation, innate immunity and gut epithelial barrier dysfunction. Lastly, we will conduct a pilot study testing two different doses of zinc supplementation in HIV-infected subjects on ART with documented zinc deficiency. This pilot trial will also explore whether this strategy may affect selected inflammation markers and will help guide the next phase of investigations. In the R33 phase, we will conduct a pilot randomized placebo-controlled study of zinc supplementation in HIV-infected subjects on ART with zinc deficiency, and we will assess whether zinc supplementation is safe and effective at increasing zinc levels, and whether it will affect different pathways involved in HIV-comorbidities, namely innate immunity, systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and gut epithelial barrier dysfunction. Our proposal should provide important mechanistic insights to inform us on the mechanism of action through which zinc may produce clinical benefit in the HIV+ population, and as such will provide the information necessary to develop a competitive full-scale clinical trial.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Despite the advent of safer HIV therapies, several comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes are more common in people living with HIV, and have been linked to heightened inflammation state. Zinc deficiency (or low zinc levels) has been associated with abnormal state of heightened inflammation and with altered gut barrier in the general population. Little is known about the frequency and consequences of zinc deficiency in people living with HIV despite the fact that this population is known to have high inflammation and abnormal gut barrier. We will measure zinc levels in a group of HIV positive individuals and a group of HIV negative controls, and we will explore whether zinc deficiency is associated with high inflammation and abnormal gut barrier in these groups. In addition, we will conduct a novel pilot trial to study the effect of zinc supplementatio to modulate inflammation and repair abnormal gut barrier. The results of this study should inform public health efforts to ameliorate the risk of comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease not only in HIV-infected subjects, but also in other conditions where inflammation is enhanced, such as rheumatoid arthritis.",

dramatically worldwide. It is estimated that obesity is second only to smoking as a cause of premature
preventable death. This is largely due to the comorbidities associated with obesity including metabolic syndrome,
diabetes, cardiovascular disease and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Yet, very little progress has been made in
the development of treatments to prevent obesity and its comorbidities, and the mechanistic link between obesity
and development of comorbidities is not completely understood. Several studies have shown that obese rodents
develop tissue vitamin A deficiency, with tissue retinoid concentrations decreasing by a stunning 75-90%,
suggesting profound metabolic dysregulation. Findings in cell systems and animal models demonstrate that
retinoids regulate adipocyte differentiation and glucose and lipid metabolism and, further, that decreased retinoid
concentrations are associated with progressive obesity, insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. Thus,
aggregate preclinical data suggest that altered vitamin A metabolism may contribute directly to obesity
progression and the development of obesity-related co-morbidities. Critically, the mechanisms underlying this
dysregulated vitamin A metabolism remain poorly understood, and the relevance of these preclinical findings to
human obesity is unclear. A central premise of this proposal is that altered vitamin A metabolism in obesity is a
result of increased inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6 and TNF in metabolic tissues, which regulate the
expression of the retinoid metabolizing enzymes CYP26, LRAT, ALDH1A and RDH in adipocytes and various
liver cell types. We further hypothesize that this dysregulation of vitamin A metabolism occurs in human obesity
as well as in animal models. We will test our hypotheses in two specific aims: 1) to identify the enzymes and the
key regulatory signals that control all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) concentrations and vitamin A metabolic flux in
human liver and adipose tissue, and 2) to establish whether adipose tissue and liver vitamin A metabolomes are
altered in obese humans. We will use our state-of-the-art mass spectrometry methods, innovative metabolic flux
experiments and kinetic modeling in specific cell types to characterize the key enzymes that metabolize retinoids
in liver and adipose tissue and determine how the activity of these enzymes is altered in obesity. To determine
whether tissue retinoids are altered in human obesity, we will conduct a cross sectional clinical study comparing
visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue, liver and serum vitamin A metabolomes in obese and non-obese
subjects. The proposed studies will lay the foundation for understanding the regulation of vitamin A metabolism
in human liver and adipose tissue and for determing how vitamin A metabolism may become dysregulated in
obesity contributing to progressive obesity and its co-morbidities in humans. The results will generate
unprecedented insight into human retinoid biology and ultimately could lead to targeted therapeutic interventions
designed to restore tissue retinoid signaling as a novel strategy for the treatment of obesity and its sequela.","The obesity epidemic is a major public health burden and incurs annual healthcare costs in excess of $150
million in the U.S. alone. Rodent models suggest that obesity is associated with significant tissue vitamin A
deficiency which, in turn, contributes to progressive obesity and development of obesity-associated co-
morbidities. This project will help define the mechanisms regulating tissue-specific vitamin A metabolism in
humans, determine the relevance of preclinical findings to human obesity, and establish whether tissue retinoids
may be potential novel treatment targets for obesity and its associated co-morbidities.",

ABSTRACT
In the past 5 years, the Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) has increased cumulative enrollment
to over 2000 adult and pediatric patients in the ongoing Prospective and Retrospective registry studies.
In addition, an “Acute” DILI protocol with collection of serial early biological samples for mechanistic
biomarker studies was developed and implemented. Other network aims included investigation of the
role of genetic polymorphisms in DILI susceptibility and outcome, development of improved causality
assessment methods, and expansion of the LiverTox website. The University of Michigan team led by
Dr. Fontana has played an important role in the design, implementation, and analysis of the primary and
ancillary DILIN studies since its inception in 2003. Michigan has not only been a leading enroller in all of
the ongoing Registry studies but also provided important leadership in multiple DILIN committees and
initiatives. The Michigan team now proposes a series of novel and feasible study aims for the DILIN
renewal. The PRIMARY AIM of this proposal is to continue to recruit and enroll high causality adult and
pediatric DILI cases into the registry studies for genetic, immunologic, biomarker and mechanistic
studies. The Michigan Hepatotoxicity Network has specific plans to increase the enrollment of ethnic
minorities via the engagement of hepatologists/ collaborators in southeastern Michigan and elsewhere
that care for a large number of African American, Hispanic, and Asian patients. In addition, further
development of natural language processing algorithms to search the EMR at the University of Michigan
are proposed to facilitate enrollment. Qualitative, quantitative and toxicological studies of the chemical
constituents in the herbal and dietary supplement (HDS) products implicated in a growing proportion of
DILI cases will be expanded via an ongoing collaboration with the National Center for National Products
Research. The SECOND AIM of this proposal is to conduct pilot/ feasibility clinical trials to improve the
outcomes of patients with severe acute DILI and those at risk for developing chronic DILI. Proposed
study designs include a 12 week course of a simple and safe, orally administered anti-inflammatory or
anti-oxidant agent (e.g. budesonide, SAMe, vitamin E) in selected patients with severe acute DILI at risk
for adverse outcomes. In addition, 12 to 24 week studies of a safe and effective orally administered anti-
cholestatic agent such as an ileal apical bile salt transport inhibitor that may reduce serum bile acids are
proposed for subjects at risk of chronic DILI. Lastly, prospective studies of magnetic resonance
elastography and MRCP imaging are proposed to improve our understanding of the severity and natural
history of DILI. The THIRD AIM of this proposal is to further expand the LiverTox website to include
additional chapters on HDS DILI, develop and implement a computerized causality assessment
instrument, and assemble working committees to insure that the website content remains up to date and
pertinent. Finally, additional collaborations between DILIN and the US FDA and other regulatory
agencies are proposed to enhance the pharmacovigilance capabilities of DILIN for new causes of DILI
and temporal changes over time.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
The University of Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network proposes to improve our understanding of
the etiologies, risk factors, and outcomes of DILI via the continued enrollment of adult and pediatric
patients including targeted enrollment of ethnic minority patients that will help determine if there are racial
differences in DILI susceptibility and outcomes via analysis of collected biological samples, DNA, liver
tissue, and clinical data. Pilot/ feasibility clinical trials of simple, safe and mechanistically based
treatments for patients with severe acute DILI and those at risk for developing chronic DILI are also
proposed. Finally, further development and enhancement of the LiverTox website is proposed to
include additional chapters on HDS DILI, development and implementation of a computerized diagnostic
instrument, and expansion of the pharmacovigilance capabilities of DILIN.",

cytokines and other circulating metabolites contributing to inflammation. Gut microbial composition and
function are amenable to modification by diet. Flaxseed (FS), a whole food commonly consumed as a dietary
adjuvant for several purported health effects, is a rich source of the polyphenolic lignans. Structurally similar to
endogenous estrogens, lignans have been most widely studied for phytoestrogen effects; however, anti-
inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antioxidant effects have also been reported, primarily in animal and cell
models. Importantly, to become physiologically available to humans, plant lignans require metabolism to
enterolignans by a consortium of gut microbial community members, but not all individuals are enterolactone
producers. Plant lignans are converted by the gut bacteria to the primary circulating enterolignan
enterolactone (ENL) which can be measured in most body fluids. ENL has been inversely associated with
several inflammation-related chronic diseases and, as a bacterial metabolite, has significant potential to impact
health. Using existing data and specimens from a completed flaxseed intervention study in healthy,
postmenopausal African American (AA) and non-Hispanic White (NHW) women that investigated the impact of
the intervention on gut microbial communities, lignan metabolism, and steroid hormone metabolism, we will
accomplish the following Aims: 1) In the overall study sample, determine associations between gut microbial
community profiles, circulating metabolic profiles, and circulating inflammation-related cytokines for women
who are high vs low ENL producers; 2) In a subset of women (n=80; 40 high producers [20 AA, 20 NHW], 40
low producers [20 AA, 20 NHW]), utilize metatranscriptomics to a) characterize the impact of the FS
intervention on pre- and postintervention microbial gene expression, b) determine associations between
microbial gene expression and circulating metabolites and inflammation-related cytokines, and c) how these
associations differ by producer status and race; and 3) In the subset of women in Aim 2, utilize fecal
metabolomics to characterize microbial metabolic profiles pre- and post-intervention, and determine
associations with microbial gene expression (metatranscriptomics), circulating metabolites, and inflammation-
related cytokines. We hypothesize that the FS intervention will modify microbial gene expression and
metabolic pathways related to chronic low grade inflammation and these pathways will differ by producer
status and for AA and NHW women. The proposed study offers a unique opportunity to characterize changes
in microbial function and subsequent modification of circulating metabolic profiles related to chronic low grade
inflammation in a generous sample of AA and NHW white women. Given the higher incidence of inflammation

Asthma and allergic diseases continue to be major public health problems resulting in significant disability and resource
utilization globally. Most asthma is diagnosed before the age of six. Thus, prenatal and early life exposures play an
important role in the development of asthma and allergies. On the basis of finding an inverse association between family
size and atopy, it was postulated that reduced microbial exposure in early life explains the epidemic of allergic diseases
(the “hygiene hypothesis”). The original hygiene hypothesis has undergone changes and refinement, and is now taken to
mean not just simply a reduced microbial exposure, but perhaps changes in the breadth and types of microorganisms
coupled with changing environments. The gut flora is, quantitatively, the most important postnatal source of microbial
stimulation of the immune system. Significant differences between the gut flora of children in industrialized and
developing nations suggest that the high prevalence of asthma in affluent nations may be due to changes in the
intestinal flora of young infants. This concept of “dysbiotic drift,” whereby environmental forces related to Westernized
lifestyles leads to a shift of the developing microbiota away from the norm, may explain why many chronic inflammatory
conditions, such as asthma, are associated with Westernized lifestyles. Dysbiosis is a potential mechanism by which the
environment interacts with the early developing immune system to program risk for chronic disease.
While there are a growing number of studies that are investigating the role of the intestinal microbiome in asthma,
these have examined stool samples obtained at one point in time. Since the intestinal microbiome undergoes rapid
changes before it becomes established between the ages of 1 and 3 years of life, longitudinal studies are needed.
Additionally, no studies have accounted for the host genetic background, which may determine both the development
of dysbiosis and who develops asthma when faced with dysbiosis. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that
vitamin D deficiency in the pre-, peri-, and immediate post-natal periods, in addition to host genetic influences, lead
to intestinal dysbiosis in early life. Dysbiosis, in the proper host genetic context, then increases the risk for
development of asthma. While we have collected information on a host of other relevant exposures, this proposal will
focus on vitamin D as the primary exposure of interest. We have put together 2 vitamin D clinical trial populations –
Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART) and Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood
(COPSAC2010) – with prospective collection of exposures during pregnancy and early life, that we will leverage to test our
hypotheses. This proposal is in response to FOA RFA-OD-16-004, Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes
(ECHO) Pediatric Cohorts (UG3/UH3).
In these cohorts, we will first determine the patterns of change in the early intestinal microbiome (both composition and
metabolic function) up to age 6 years that are related with vitamin D deficiency in the prenatal and perinatal periods.
We will also investigate genetic markers of the host that affect these patterns in the intestinal microbiome. We will then
investigate the relationship of these patterns of change in the microbiome with the presence of asthma by age 6 years.
Findings from this project will point to potential mechanisms by which early environmental exposures interact with the
developing intestinal microbiome and the host to confer risk for asthma.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Asthma and allergies are the most common chronic disorders in children. There is a lack of understanding of
the risk factors and mechanisms that lead to asthma and allergies. We will investigate the role of two novel risk
factors – vitamin D and the intestinal microbiome – on the risk of asthma and allergies in the child, and
findings from this important and efficient study could form the basis for development of new and important
approaches to reduction of these conditions.",

Despite strong anti-smoking efforts, at least 12% of American women cannot quit smoking when
pregnant, resulting in more than 450,000 smoke-exposed infants born yearly. Maternal smoking during
pregnancy adversely affects lung development as seen by lifelong decreases in pulmonary function and
increased risk of asthma. In a randomized controlled trial (RCT), published in JAMA, we have provided
evidence that maternal vitamin C supplementation (500 mg daily during pregnancy) can decrease the effects of
maternal smoking during pregnancy on offspring lung function and the subsequent incidence of wheeze. The
purpose of this ECHO application is to combine the offspring from the prenatal cohorts of two RCTs studying
the effects of vitamin C supplementation to pregnant smokers on offspring respiratory outcomes and to
determine if the innovative therapy of maternal vitamin C supplementation during pregnancy leads to
prolonged improvements on offspring’s pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and respiratory health. To begin to
understand mechanisms by which prenatal vitamin C may be preventing changes in the health of offspring of
smokers, we examined gene specific DNA methylation from a subset of placentas, cord bloods and buccal
swabs (ages 2-5) collected from subjects who were the offspring of prospectively-followed pregnant placebo-
treated smokers, vitamin C-treated smokers, or non-smokers. In parallel with the effects of vitamin C on the
reduction of the effects of maternal smoking on offspring PFTs and wheeze, the supplementary vitamin C
prevented the majority of significant changes in DNA methylation induced by maternal smoking in both
placentas and cord blood. Strikingly, this prevention of alterations in DNA methylation was still evident 2-5
years later in offspring buccal swabs. This preliminary data suggests that the mechanism underlying vitamin
C’s prevention of some of the effects of maternal smoking on offspring pulmonary health involves the
prevention of epigenetic changes induced by maternal smoking. Thus this application has 4 specific aims: 1,
to create the combined cohort of offspring from the 2 RCTs of vitamin C supplementation to pregnant smokers;
2, to determine if the protective effects of maternal vitamin C supplementation to pregnant smokers on
offspring pulmonary health extend to early adolescence; 3, to begin to characterize the epigenetic mechanisms
that appear to underlie the effects of smoking during pregnancy on offspring lung health and on the protective
effects of vitamin C; and 4, to gather core data for and interact with the overall ECHO study. Respiratory
health will be assessed by longitudinal semi-annual, validated respiratory histories and yearly PFTs beginning
at 3 years of age. Buccal swabs will be collected yearly and blood at 6, 9 and 12 years to provide DNA for
genetic analysis. DNA methylation changes will be measured by methylation chips and bisulfite sequencing.
This study will address how smoking during pregnancy affects respiratory outcomes, provide mechanistic and
therapeutic insights, and provide subjects and data to ECHO to address other key outcomes.","Narrative
Maternal smoking during pregnancy is the largest preventable cause of childhood respiratory
illness, and children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy show lifetime decreases in
pulmonary function and increased respiratory illnesses and asthma. Sadly, more than 50% of
smokers who become pregnant continue to smoke and approximately 20% of expenditures for
childhood respiratory illness are caused by maternal smoking amounting to over $1 billion
annually in current health care dollars. The purpose of this ECHO application is to combine two
prenatal cohorts to study the effects of maternal smoking during pregnancy on respiratory
outcomes, determine if the innovative therapy of maternal vitamin C supplementation during
pregnancy leads to prolonged improvements on offspring’s pulmonary function tests and
respiratory health, and to interact with the greater ECHO cohort to promote childhood health
and well-being.",

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) arises through T-cell mediated killing of the pancreatic beta-cells. It has a strong
genetic component, but environmental factors likely influence disease triggering as well as the post-onset
disease course. In human T1D families, we have identified an elevated inflammatory state that is consistent
with exposure to microbial antigens. In healthy siblings of probands, this familial innate inflammation is
supplanted by an age-dependent regulatory state that includes temporal increases in peripheral activated
regulatory T-cell frequencies. We have identified a similar inflammatory state in the BioBreeding DR rat model
of T1D. DR rats are not spontaneously diabetic, however T1D can be triggered in young animals by viral
infection. Importantly, the innate inflammatory state in DR rats is temporally supplanted by an IL-10/TGF-β-
mediated regulatory state that coincides with the inability of virus to induce T1D in older animals. In line with
studies that implicate an altered gastrointestinal microbiota in T1D pathogenesis, modulation of the microbiota
in healthy siblings of T1D probands or DR rats partially normalizes the underlying inflammatory state. In
BioBreeding rats, such treatments prevent development of T1D. Our studies suggest that T1D progression is
promoted when the genetically controlled but environmentally influenced familial innate state is augmented by
additional inflammatory signals prior to the establishment of robust counter-regulatory mechanisms. Our
studies have also focused on the persistence of insulin secretion after T1D onset, which is clinically significant
as even modest residual beta cell function is associated with reduced risk of complications. These studies
have utilized a plasma-based transcriptional bioassay that quantitatively captures inflammatory: regulatory
balance. Importantly, new onset T1D patients with short post-onset partial remissions, exhibit plasma based
signatures with predictively higher inflammatory bias, as well as reduced peripheral regulatory T-cell
abundances. In genetically susceptible healthy subjects and T1D patients, we hypothesize
that levels of immune activity are in part governed by composition of the microbiota and systemic microbial
antigen exposure. This in turn influences the rate of T1D progression as measured by duration of the post-
onset partial remission. With our large patient population and expertise, we are well-positioned to test the
hypothesis that the inflammatory state associated with T1D and T1D susceptibility can be partially normalized
through probiotic supplementation. We propose the following specific aims.
1. Determine whether Lactobacillus plantarum 299v supplement reduces systemic inflammation and
prolongs residual β-cell function in new onset T1D.
2. Define how L. plantarum 299v supplementation alters immune activity in new onset T1D.","Project Narrative

Our broad, long-term goal is to develop rational therapeutics for the orphan disease pantothenate kinase-
associated neurodegeneration (PKAN), an inborn error of vitamin B5 metabolism that is caused by defects in
the gene that encodes PANK2, the first regulatory step in the coenzyme A biosynthetic pathway, and to do so
as cost-effectively as possible. Children and adults affected by the disease develop a severe movement
disorder and a characteristic pattern of abnormal iron accumulation in the brain. PKAN causes profound
disability and suffering, especially in children, many of whom succumb to complications of the disease in the
first decade of life. No proven disease-modifying therapy is currently available.
In this project, we will build on recent work from the laboratory demonstrating a compelling, disease-relevant
molecular and functional signature in the PKAN mouse brain that is recapitulated in both fibroblast cell cultures
and in peripheral blood from human patients. This biological signature is ameliorated in vivo and in vitro by a
product of intermediary metabolism in a dose-dependent fashion.
In this application, we propose to extend this work to the clinic, evaluating the safety, tolerability and
pharmacodynamic profile of the product in a phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-
ranging, parallel-group study in children and adults with PKAN. A 6-month double-blind phase will be followed
by an 18-month open-label phase. We will also explore the feasibility of applying a latent growth curve
modeling approach to longitudinal natural history data to capture a disease modifying effect, with the goal of
informing future study design. We will employ a novel approach to study conduct that is designed to reduce the
barriers to study participation inherent in rare disease clinical research, minimize risks to subjects, and lessen
the burden on families.","Project Narrative

Public Health Issue: Low circulating levels of 25(OH) vitamin D (VD) have been correlated with many
adverse health conditions and health disparities in African Americans (AA). Supraphysiological high-dose VD
supplementation is required to eliminate the differences observed in the levels of circulating 25(OH)VD in AA
and white subjects. However, recent studies have questioned the therapeutic effects of high-dose VD
supplementation.
Rationale: Glutathione (GSH) is a major physiological antioxidant. Recent studies report that low levels of
GSH are linked to 25(OH)VD deficiencies in both animal and human studies. Animal studies using ZDF rats
and a mouse model of 25(OH)VD deficiency have shown that, compared to supplementation with VD-alone,
co-supplementation with VD (cholecalciferol) + L-cysteine (LC, a GSH precursor) led to an improvement in
GSH status that resulted in significant increases in circulating levels of 25(OH)VD and reduced oxidative
stress, TNF-α, and insulin resistance (IR).
Approach: AA have reduced levels of glutathione (GSH), as well as a high incidence of insulin resistance (IR)
and inflammatory disorders. This R33 application presents our design for a randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled clinical trial to test the hypothesis that supplementation with VD in combination with L-cysteine (a
GSH precursor) is more successful at optimizing the statuses of 25(OH)VD and GSH [biological signatures]
and simultaneously decreasing TNF-α and IR [functional or clinical outcomes], suggesting a better therapeutic
approach compared with supplementation with VD alone in AA subjects.
Impact on Public Health: The successful completion of this R33 clinical trial will have a significant impact on
the design of future efficacy clinical trials examining co-supplementation using a GSH precursor coupled with
lower VD doses to reduce 25(OH)VD deficiency/inadequacy, inflammation, and IR biomarkers. The
development of a safe, low-cost dietary supplement that can improve 25-hydroxy vitamin D status and reduce
insulin resistance and inflammation would provide significant benefits in the treatment of pre-diabetes and
health disparities, including chronic pain, in the African American population.
This application, which is highly responsive to PAR-18-828, will replicate previous human studies and examine
the outcome of biological signatures by combining the natural product L-cysteine with VD to optimize its
supplementation and efficacy.","NARRATIVE SUMMARY/RELEVANCE
 Two-thirds of our population is at risk for 25-hydroxy vitamin D deficiency and its associated health
hazards, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. This has led to widespread vitamin D
supplementation by the public. However, supraphysiological supplementation of vitamin D is needed to
achieve normal circulating 25-hydroxy VD levels, and some subjects respond poorly to supplementation or
experience side effects.
 The African-American (AA) population has been reported to have a higher incidence of 25-hydroxy VD
deficiency as well as clinical pain. This study will investigate whether the combined use of the nutrients VD
and L-cysteine exerts measurable and beneficial effects on 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels and insulin resistance
biomarkers. The translation and validation of our novel hypothesis could have a tremendous impact on medical
practice, leading to the novel recommendation that supplementation that combines the use of vitamin D and a
GSH precursor is superior to the current practice of supplementation with high-dose vitamin D alone.
 The long-term goal is to discover new approaches to ensure adequate 25(OH)VD status and to
prevent the adverse effects of vitamin D deficiency on health conditions in the African-American population.",

Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) comprise a range of effects resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure
(PAE) including neurological abnormalities, cognitive and behavioral impairments, growth retardation, and
craniofacial anomalies. Very few treatments have been investigated despite FASD’s tremendous public health
burden. Neurocognitive deficits are a core feature of FASD, and cognition is a natural target for intervention
because deficits contribute to problems with adaptive functioning, social skills, and independent living. One
potential intervention for the cognitive impairments in FASD is the essential nutrient choline - which is known to
have numerous direct effects on brain development and emerging cognition. Choline impacts
neurodevelopment broadly, but especially in the hippocampus; choline contributes to increased dendritic
arborization, larger cells, and functional changes. Choline affects the cholinergic system and alters brain
structure and function in regions essential for memory functioning, including methylation in the hippocampus
and prefrontal cortex. Only a handful of human choline studies for FASD have been undertaken and our group
has conducted most of them. Our early double-blind, randomized, controlled trial established safety and
tolerability. Our subsequent trial revealed beneficial effects for sequential delayed memory in participants with
FASD (greater in younger [ages 2-3] rather than older [ages 3-5] children). Our third (ongoing) study included
a long-term follow-up that demonstrated permanent benefits for choline vs. placebo in non-verbal processing,
working memory, long-term verbal memory, and ADHD behavior. The proposed studies will capitalize on
three existing cohorts for additional longitudinal studies that have the potential to show permanency of the
effects of early treatment. A 4-year and 8-year follow-up study will each examine cognitive effects as well as
structural and functional brain effects using advance MRI methods. Cognitive measures will include the
Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale, the Elicited Imitation memory test, the NIH Toolbox Flanker test and Picture
Sequence Memory Test, and the Minnesota Executive Function Scale. We will examine choline effects on
behavior using parent-report (Child Behavior Checklist). Hippocampus in particular will be examined for
volumetric alterations following choline, including alterations at the level of sub-structures. Hippocampal
connectivity will be examined and is expected to reflect changes from early choline supplementation. Lastly,
the proposed studies will include a new clinical trial with a new cohort of 2-5 year old children with FASD.
Rather than a placebo-controlled trial, this will be a 3-arm dose finding study in which participants will receive
choline for one of three durations (3, 6, or 9 months). Results of the trial will directly inform future clinical
implementation of choline as a neurodevelopmental intervention.","NARRATIVE
We have completed several studies of choline supplementation in children with neurodevelopmental
abnormalities resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE): a feasibility study, a pilot efficacy study, and a
long-term follow-up study. The proposed study will continue that work, helping to determine whether choline
supplementation during a specific developmental window when the child’s brain remains plastic is able to
attenuate the deficits in thinking, memory, processing speed, and behavior that are common in children with
PAE and whether these changes are long-lasting. We will also use MRI to measure changes in the trajectory
of structures known to be involved in these cognitive functions as well as to examine the development of
connectivity in response to choline or placebo.",

 Arsenic (As) exposure afflicts >140 million people in 70+ countries worldwide, including the U.S., and
contributes to cancer and many other chronic diseases. Chronic exposure to manganese (Mn), a known
neurotoxin, through contaminated drinking water afflicts 50+ countries, including the U.S., and may interact
with As exposure for some outcomes. Furthermore, enforceable drinking water standards and biomarkers of
Mn exposure are lacking. Strategies to identify individuals at risk are urgently needed. Despite years of
research, the mechanisms by which As exposure leads to adverse health outcomes remains poorly
understood. Innovative approaches are needed to characterize metabolic effects of As and Mn exposures –
prior to disease onset – to begin to better understand the underlying mechanisms, ultimately to identify
individuals at risk. Once ingested, inorganic As undergoes methylation by S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to form
mono- (MMAs) and di-methyl (DMAs) arsenicals in a process that facilitates urinary As elimination. Methyl
groups from folate are required for SAM synthesis. In our recently completed randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled folic acid clinical trial (FACT) in Bangladesh, we demonstrated that FA supplementation
significantly increased As methylation to DMAs and thereby lowered blood As and blood MMAs, a toxic
intermediate. We propose to leverage data and biological samples from FACT to employ novel ultra high-
resolution metabolomics (HRM) analyses to identify metabolites and metabolic pathways associated with As
exposure, As exposure reduction, As methylation and the independent and joint effects of Mn exposure.
 The unique FACT study design includes provision of As-removal filters with/without FA supplementation (400
or 800 µg/d × 12 or 24 weeks). This design permits us to identify and validate novel metabolites and pathways
altered by As exposure and As methylation profiles (Aim 1a); Mn exposure (Aim 1b); and reduction in As
exposure (Aim 2a). Aims 2b-c allow us to identify persistence/reversibility by FA treatment, including effects of
dose-dependent increases in As methylation facilitated by FA supplementation; and the impact of co-exposure
to Mn (Aim 2d). In a new collaboration with Dr. Walker, Director of the Metabolomics Center at Mt. Sinai, we
will combine FACT’s rigorous RCT approach–the best possible design to determine causality in humans–with
our HRM platform that interrogates thousands of metabolites and most metabolic pathways. We will use dose-
and duration-dependent approaches to enhance the rigor of our findings. In Aim 3a, in a new collaboration with
Dr. Kioumourtzoglou at Columbia, we will use novel and robust pattern recognition approaches to identify
specific metabolic patterns that are impacted by As and Mn exposures. Aim 3b will use hierarchical modeling
to comprehensively quantify the As and Mn impacts on the pathways identified in Aims 1 and 2. The findings of
this study may inform policy decisions regarding FA fortification programs in As-endemic areas and may

Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on
the host. One of the most common indications for probiotic treatment is the prevention of antibiotic-associated
diarrhea (AAD). Unfortunately, the efficacy of many probiotic products used for AAD is not supported by
rigorous independent research, and non-evidence-based clinical usage is common. Data from several studies
suggest antibiotic-induced disruption of commensal colonic bacteria results in a significant reduction in short
chain fatty acid (SCFA) production and a concomitant reduction in Na-dependent fluid absorption, ultimately
resulting in AAD. The probiotic strain Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 (BB-12) has been shown to
ameliorate a variety of gastrointestinal disease states and is known to produce acetate – the most abundant
primary colonic SCFA – at concentrations of up to 50 mM in vitro. Thus, we hypothesize that the concurrent
administration of BB-12 with antibiotics will protect against the development of AAD by the ability of BB-12 to
both generate acetate directly, and increase other SCFAs through cross-feeding of certain bacteria in the
Firmicutes phylum. For example, Clostridium, Eubacterium and Roseburia use acetate to produce butyrate,
another common SCFA. The primary aim of the R61 phase (N=60) is to determine if BB-12 can mitigate
antibiotic-induced reduction in SCFA concentration, as reflected in fecal acetate levels. We hypothesize that
antibiotics will decrease fecal SCFAs, but BB-12 supplementation will protect against antibiotic-induced SCFA
reduction, and/or be associated with quicker restoration to baseline SCFA levels as compared to control.
Antibiotic administration also lowers total microbial counts and diversity in the gut microbiota, disrupting the
homeostasis of the gut ecosystem and allowing colonization by pathogens. The secondary aim uses 16S rDNA
profiling to determine if BB-12 inhibits antibiotic-induced disruption of the gut microbiota. We hypothesize that
antibiotics will diminish the overall number and diversity of bacterial species present in the fecal microbiota,
and concurrent BB-12 supplementation will minimize antibiotic-induced shifts in the microbiota, and/or will be
associated with shorter recovery to baseline microbiota composition as compared to control. In the R33 phase
(N=108), to further delineate the effects of BB-12 administration on the antibiotic-depleted gut microbiota, we
will evaluate the timing of probiotic administration in four randomly assigned groups: 1) BB-12 yogurt
consumed at the same time as the antibiotic; 2) control yogurt consumed at the same time as the antibiotic; 3)
BB-12 yogurt consumed four hours after the antibiotic; and 4) control yogurt consumed four hours after the
antibiotic. Our long-term goal is to determine the impact of BB-12 on a variety of gastrointestinal disease states
and ages. Elucidation of the mechanism(s) of action will be integral in shaping the direction of future
translational research on probiotic effectiveness.","Project Narrative
Probiotics are commonly used to address gastrointestinal issues, such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea. While
some studies have shown that probiotics may help prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea, the mechanism of

Abnormalities in cognition and mobility are common accompaniments of aging that often precede the
development of Alzheimer’s disease. Among their many etiologies, these abnormalities are associated with
alterations in the regulation of cerebral blood flow to frontal regions of the brain that subserve executive
functions and gait speed. We have previously shown that treatment with cocoa flavanols can improve blood
flow in response to a cognitive task (neurovascular coupling [NVC]), as well as executive function in older
people with impaired NVC. These compounds can also reduce the number of senescent cells and their toxic
secretory products (SASP) in a variety of tissues. In mice, “senolytic” compounds such as flavanols and
tyrosine kinase inhibitors, have been shown to reduce neurofibrillary tangle density, neuron loss, and
ventricular enlargement, and in humans with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, improve gait speed and other
functional abilities. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that the flavanol, Quercetin, and tyrosine kinase
inhibitor, Dasatinib, (Q+D) will improve NVC in response to an executive task, reduce circulating SASP
components, and in so doing, improve cognition and mobility in older adults who are at risk of Alzheimer’s
disease. Our specific aims are: 1) To conduct a 12-week single arm, open label, pre-post pilot study to
determine the feasibility and recruitment challenges of studying intermittent doses of Quercetin and Dasatinib
(Q+D) in 12 older adults aged 70 to 90 years with slow gait speed (<1.0 m/sec) and Mild Cognitive Impairment;
2) To obtain preliminary data on the effect of this Q+D regimen on: a) resting cerebral blood flow (CBF) and
neurovascular coupling (NVC) during an executive task, b) gait speed and executive function, and c) other
secondary measures of physical and cognitive performance; and 3) To develop preliminary evidence
concerning whether Q+D is associated with a) a reduction in biomarkers of senescence in serum and urine
and senescent cells in blood, and b) whether reductions in these biomarkers are associated with improvements
in NVC, gait speed, and executive function. This research will leverage the expertise and resources of the
Boston Pepper Center and Mayo Clinic-based Translational Geroscience Network. Its results may identify a
novel approach for improving cerebral blood flow regulation, mobility, and cognition in older adults, and
preventing their progression to Alzheimer’s disease. The study may also help establish proof-of-concept that
the cognitive and functional disabilities of older age may arise, in part, from the secretory products of
senescent cells and be alleviated by senolytic agents.","Narrative: The long-term goal of this study is to prevent common age-related impairments in cognition and
mobility that lead to the development of Alzheimer’s disease by interrupting one of the fundamental
mechanisms of aging, namely the accumulation of senescent cells and their damaging products. We will
determine the feasibility of administering Quercetin and Dasatinib to eliminate these cells from the body, and
test whether their elimination can improve brain blood flow, cognition, and mobility in older adults at risk of
developing Alzheimer’s disease.",

Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem worldwide, and half of patients presenting with HF have
preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), rather than reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). However, HFpEF remains
a therapeutic challenge, given current limited understanding of causal and contributing factors. Functional iron
deficiency (FID, defined as a ferritin level < 100 ng/ml or transferrin saturation (Tsat) < 20% with ferritin < 300
ng/ml) is present in approximately half of all patients with either HFpEF or HFrEF. In patients with HFrEF, FID
is associated with reduced exercise capacity, poorer quality of life, and increased mortality regardless of
hemoglobin level. Correction of FID consistently and durably improves exercise capacity in HFrEF, however
less is known about the functional impact of FID in patients with HFpEF or in the general population. Beyond
its role in erythropoiesis, iron is an obligate component of myoglobin and enzymes involved in cellular
respiration, oxidative phosphorylation, vascular homeostasis, nitric oxide generation, and the citric acid cycle,
which all can be negatively impacted by iron deficiency. Hepcidin, a hormone synthesized by the liver, is
considered the master regulator of iron homeostasis. Hepcidin reduces iron bioavailability and levels are
regulated by inflammatory signaling pathways (eg, IL-6, IL-1β) and by the protein hemojuvelin which plays a
critical role in iron sensing. We have previously demonstrated that lower hepcidin levels are cardioprotective in
animal model studies and that elevated hepcidin levels in symptomatic HFrEF patients precluded normalization
of FID with oral iron supplementation in the NIH-sponsored multi-center IRONOUT-HF Trial. In our preliminary
studies of HFpEF patients undergoing comprehensive cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) FID with
reduced Tsat/hepcidin ratio was associated with exercise cardiac output, peripheral O2 extraction, pulmonary
vascular resistance and peak VO2, implicating FID as an important determinant of multiple aspects of exercise
capacity. We now propose to measure iron status, hepcidin and hemojuvelin levels in a large community-
based cohort (Framingham Heart Study Gen3/OMNI2, N=3,116) and in a referral cohort with suspected
HFpEF (MGH ExS, N=450) to understand the role of FID in relation to functional capacity, leveraging existing
CPET measures of low-level, intermediate and peak exercise O2 utilization in both cohorts. Our overarching
hypothesis is that FID arises in the setting of pro-inflammatory states that precede overt HFpEF, which is
characterized by impaired ability to augment O2 utilization, as reflected by reduced peak VO2. In Aim 1A, we
will determine the prevalence, risk factors, genetic determinants, and functional significance of functional iron
deficiency (FID) in the community. In Aim 1B, we will determine how FID relates to organ-specific dysfunction
indicative of HFpEF subphenotypes in the MGH Exercise Study. In Aim 2, we will prospectively investigate how
treatment of FID in a randomized trial of iron repletion in 66 HFpEF patients improves exercise capacity and
influences distinct mechanisms of exercise intolerance.","Project Narrative (Public Health Relevance)
Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a highly morbid condition in which exercise capacity is
significantly reduced. Our goal is to understand how functional iron deficiency relates to exercise capacity in
HFpEF and in middle-aged adults at risk for HFpEF. We will then perform a trial to investigate how iron repletion
influences mechanisms of exercise intolerance in patients with symptomatic HFpEF.",

Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) comprise a range of effects resulting from prenatal alcohol
exposure (PAE) including neurological abnormalities, cognitive and behavioral impairments, growth
retardation, and craniofacial anomalies. Few treatments have been investigated despite FASD’s
tremendous public health burden. Cognitive deficits are a core feature of FASD, and cognition is a
natural target for intervention. One potential intervention for cognition in FASD is the essential
nutrient choline - known to have effects on brain development and cognition. In the hippocampus,
choline contributes to increased dendritic arborization, larger cells, and functional changes. Choline
affects the cholinergic system and alters brain structure and function in regions essential for memory
functioning, including methylation in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Only a handful of human
choline studies for FASD have been undertaken and our group has conducted most of them. Our
early double-blind, randomized, controlled trial established safety and tolerability. Our subsequent
trial revealed beneficial effects for sequential delayed memory in participants with FASD (greater in
younger [ages 2-3] rather than older [ages 3-5] children). Our third (ongoing) study included a long-
term follow-up that demonstrated long-term benefits for choline vs. placebo in non-verbal processing,
working memory, long-term verbal memory, and ADHD behavior. The proposed studies will include a
new clinical trial with a new cohort of 2-5 year old children with FASD. Rather than a placebo-
controlled trial, it will be a two-arm block-randomized study with cumulative choline exposure
durations of 3 or 6 months. Results will directly inform future clinical implementation of choline as a
neurodevelopmental intervention. The proposed studies will also capitalize on three existing cohorts
for additional longitudinal studies that will determine durability of effects from early treatment. A 4-
year and 8-year follow-up study will each examine cognitive effects as well as structural and
functional brain effects using advanced MRI methods. Cognitive measures will include the Stanford-
Binet Intelligence Scale, the Elicited Imitation memory test, the NIH Toolbox Flanker test and Picture
Sequence Memory Test, and the Minnesota Executive Function Scale. We will examine choline
effects on behavior using parent-report (CBCL) and a structured diagnostic interview (KSADS).
Select hippocampal sub-fields will be examined for volumetric improvements following choline or
placebo. Functional connectivity will be examined and is expected to reflect changes from early
choline supplementation. We will also use cortical myelin mapping to evaluate choline’s effect on
long-term myelin development. In addition, we will apply diffusion-weighted imaging to determine
choline’s effect on white matter microstructure – which is known to be disrupted in FASD.","NARRATIVE
We have completed several studies of choline supplementation in children with neurodevelopmental
abnormalities resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE): a feasibility study, a pilot efficacy study, and a
long-term follow-up study. The proposed study will continue that work, helping to determine whether choline
supplementation during a specific developmental window when the child’s brain remains plastic is able to
attenuate the deficits in thinking, memory, processing speed, and behavior that are common in children with
PAE and whether these changes are long-lasting. We will also use MRI to measure changes in the trajectory of
structures known to be involved in these cognitive functions as well as to examine the development of
connectivity in response to choline or placebo.",

This reaction is known to regulate the de novo purine biosynthesis and folate-dependent homocysteine re-methylation cycle. It could also play a key role in controlling the flux of one-carbon groups to anabolic pathways. In support of the role in the regulation of folate metabolism, we have recently shown that the loss of the ALDH1L1 gene in knockout mice causes functional folate deficiency, even when the mice had sufficient folate intake. Analysis of Aldh1l1 knockout mice also showed that the enzyme is the main regulator of glycine metabolism in the liver: KO mice have lower levels of glycine and glycine conjugates, indicating that the enzyme is involved in the folate-dependent synthesis of glycine from serine. We have further reported that human ALDH1L1 has six common non-synonymous exonic SNPs at the polymorphic loci rs3796191, rs2886059, rs9282691, rs2276724, rs1127717 and rs4646750 with the occurrence of haplotypes associated with these SNPs being remarkably different between ethnic populations. Our analysis of an established cohort of Hispanic children, Viva La Familia, has shown a significant reduction of serum glycine and increase in serine/glycine ratio in children with rs2276724 and rs3796191, indicating deregulation of serine to glycine conversion and re- capitulating our mouse findings. ALDH1L1 non-synonymous SNPs were also associated with markers of metabolic stress and adiposity in this cohort. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that non-synonymous ALDH1L1 SNPs produce enzyme variants with altered catalytic activity and/or stability that affects their ability to metabolize 10-formyl-THF and thus deregulates glycine metabolism. Accordingly, individuals with specific haplotypes have different ratios of THF/10-formyl-THF and serine/glycine, and altered levels of glycine and its conjugates, with perturbations in the metabotype representing a signature of metabolic health. This proposal will address the question of how haplotype-specific ALDH1L1 variants affect folate metabolism and the overall cellular metabotype, and how the haplotype-specific effect is modified by folate supplementation, by pursuing the following specific aims. Aim 1. Functionally characterize the ALDH1L1 enzyme variants from common human haplotypes. Aim 2. Determine the impact of major ALDH1L1 haplotypes on cellular metabolism and haplotype- specific responses to various folate supplementations. Aim 3. Link ALDH1L1 haplotypes to the folate-dependent regulation of glycine metabolism and health outcomes in humans. ALDH1L1 variants are very common in different populations but their role in folate homeostasis and in the etiology of metabolic disease is largely unexplored. It is expected that ALDH1L1 haplotypes differently mediate the metabolic response to dietary folate that might require adjustments of folate intake for individuals bearing certain ALDH1L1 SNPs. By filling this knowledge gap, the proposed research will provide mechanistic insight into the metabolic regulation by ALDH1L1 SNPs and will lay ground for the evaluation of population-specific ALDH1L1 haplotypes as a disease risk factor.","The ALDH1L1 gene in folate pathways has high frequency of non-synonymous polymorphisms with resulting haplotypes being different among human populations. The proposed research will functionally characterize haplotype-specific ALDH1L1 enzyme variants, determine how they differ in the regulation of folate and glycine metabolism, and define haplotype-specific metabotypes as a function of folate status and an indicator of metabolic health.",

Basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and squamous precancers in-situ (CIS, also
known as actinic keratoses), are the most common of all human neoplasias and contribute significantly to the
national healthcare burden. While existing techniques such as cryoablation or surgical excision are generally
curative, those treatments cause scarring that can be especially disfiguring in patients at high risk for skin
cancer (i.e., patients with chronic severe photodamage; immunosuppression due to organ transplantation; or
Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome, BCNS). Photodynamic therapy (PDT) combines a photosensitizer
(protoporphyrin PpIX, induced by the administration of aminolevulic acid, ALA) with activation by visible light,
and is a completely nonscarring technique. PDT is approved by the FDA for field treatment of widespread
cutaneous precancers, and in European countries PDT is also approved for treating SCC and BCC. In the
U.S. however, approval of PDT for SCC and BCC will require further clinical trials to demonstrate an efficacy
similar to existing techniques (destructive ablation). As a new way to increase PDT efficacy, we showed that in
animal models of SCC and BCC, transient administration of Vitamin D (VD) prior to ALA-PDT enhances PpIX
accumulation and PDT efficacy. The oral (dietary) form of VD (cholecalciferol; D3, given as 10,000 IU/day for
10 days) increases PDT-induced tumor killing by several fold, and is very safe with little risk for inducing
hypercalcemia. In this grant, we propose to test this approach in human clinical trials using oral D3 as a
neoadjuvant to PDT. Aim 1 will examine the relationship between VD status (serium 25OH-D3) and PDT
efficacy for CIS. Subaim 1a is a longitudinal study to test the correlation between serum 25OH-D3 levels and
treatment outcomes in routine PDT patients in our clinics, and to examine the predictive value of certain
biomarkers (e.g. VDR allelic polymorphisms). Subaim 1b is an interventional trial to assess the benefit of
giving neoadjuvant D3 (transient oral D3) prior to PDT. Results from combined D3/PDT treatment (Subaim 1b)
will be compared to results after D3 alone (Subaim 1a), stratified by the VD deficiency status. In Aim 2, we will
examine the potential benefit of neoadjuvant D3/PDT in patients with BCNS (Gorlin-Goltz syndrome). These
patients, who have multiple BCC tumors will receive 3 bimonthly PDT treatments, and rates of tumor shrinkage
will be correlated with serum 25OH-D3 levels. Each patient will serve as his/her own control by randomizing
the order of the first two PDT treatments, one session to be done with neoadjuvant D3 and the other without.
The third PDT treatment will occur after the serum VD level has been adjusted to normal levels with D3
supplements. This approach will allow us to determine whether neoadjuvant D3/PDT can help all patients,
even the VD deficient individuals, through customization of D3 dose. Together, we expect this group of clinical
trials to establish the foundation for a new treatment modality, i.e., neoadjuvant D3/PDT for skin cancer. The
potential benefit for public health is that data showing improved efficacy of PDT with this safe and simple
approach will lay the foundation for a nonscarring alternative to surgery for early SCC and BCC tumors.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
This is a proposal to develop a new combination regimen that combines Vitamin D3 pretreatment with
photodynamic therapy (PDT), as a nonsurgical and non-scarring alternative for the treatment of skin cancer. In
clinical trials, we will test the hypothesis that oral Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) will boost the levels of target
photosensitizer (protoporphyrin IX) in widespread squamous cell precancers and in basal cell carcinoma, and
improve the therapeutic response to PDT. Our study population will comprise patients at high risk, including
organ transplant recipients and patients with the Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome. The potential benefit to public
health is a safe, efficacious, and non-scarring alternative to surgery for the treatment of skin cancer.",

 The overarching goal of Research Component 2 (RC2) is to determine whether two non-invasive biological
interventions, transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation (tVNS) and a probiotic supplementation intervention (PBI), will
improve cognitive and brain functioning, systemic and neuroinflammation, and gut microbiome health in people living
with HIV (PWLH) who are high risk users of alcohol. The study will also delineate mechanisms of the gut-brain axis, which
is particularly relevant, given that the factors underlying adverse cognitive and brain effects of alcohol use among PLWH
remains unresolved. There is also considerable public health significance if beneficial effects of tVNS and/or PBI can be
demonstrated, as cognitive disturbances that adversely impact health outcomes, functional abilities and quality of life
are common (~ 50% prevalence), despite marked reductions in mortality in the era of antiretroviral therapies (ART).
Among PLWH with reconstituted immune function and undetectable viral loads, comorbid conditions remain common
and can have adverse functional consequences. High risk alcohol use, prevalent among PLWH, not only contributes to
cognitive and brain dysfunction, but also further exacerbates comorbidities (e.g. liver disease, hepatitis coinfection,
obesity, and cardiovascular and gastrointestinal dysfunction), and reduces treatment adherence while increasing the
propensity for high risk sexual behaviors, worse health outcomes, and transmission of the virus. The study’s clinical
significance is strong given the need for effective interventions to improve cognition and health outcomes in PLWH.
 To test these hypotheses, we will conduct a hybrid randomized clinical trial that will enroll 80 PLWH who are high
risk drinkers from our existing research infrastructure supported by the Southern HIV Alcohol Research Consortium
(SHARC). In a 2x2 factorial design, participants will be randomly assigned to one of 4 conditions (tVNS+placebo, sham-
stimulaiton+placebo, tVNS+probiotic, sham-stimulation+probiotic). We will obtain data on alcohol consumption,
cognitive assessments, blood biomarkers, stool microbiome, and neuroimaging at three timepoints (baseline, 30-days,

rising. Older adults frequently do not recover from falls, resulting in permanent disability and premature death.
Given the aging US population, identifying mechanisms by which falls occur and interventions to prevent falls
are recognized public health priorities. This proposal focuses on an innovative hypothesis that undetected or
subclinical cardiovascular disease (CVD), a condition highly prevalent in older adults, may contribute to falls in
older adults. Our scientific premise is based on our recently published work in middle-aged adults, which
demonstrated that subclinical CVD was strongly associated with orthostatic hypotension, a fall risk factor.
Given the essential role of the cardiovascular system to support functions of both muscle and the central
nervous system, we believe that CVD might promote falls in several ways beyond orthostasis, including muscle
strength, gait speed, and balance, and that elevations in markers of subclinical CVD would be associated with
a higher risk of falling. However, these pathways have not been tested in a population of older adults.
This supplement proposal aims to (1) determine the contribution of subclinical CVD toward the pathogenesis of
falls via orthostatic hypotension, and (2) determine the impact of vitamin D3 supplementation, an intervention
for falls, on subclinical CVD. We will accomplish these aims by measuring subclinical CVD via two reliable and
highly sensitive markers of cardiovascular injury and strain: high sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) and N-
terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in stored specimens of the NIA-funded trial (STURDY).
STURDY tests the effects of vitamin D3 supplementation on falls in high-risk adults, age 70 and older, and
includes detailed assessments of muscle strength, gait speed, and balance along with comprehensive
assessments of orthostatic hypotension, secondary to Dr. Juraschek's K23 ancillary proposal. Furthermore,
STURDY's randomized design, which involves one of four vitamin D3 doses administered to adults with
insufficient or deficient vitamin D, affords a tremendous opportunity to determine the direct effects of
appropriately dosed vitamin D3 on subclinical CVD.
This innovative proposal brings together (1) an expert team of STURDY investigators on orthostatic
hypotension, supplements, and the measurement of CVD biomarkers (Drs. Juraschek, Appel, Christenson), (2)
an ongoing industry partnership with Siemens which significantly reduces assay costs, (3) an incredibly unique
and established NIA study population, and (4) a remarkable track record of productivity.
This proposal has the potential to shift paradigms in how orthostatic hypotension is understood and establish
subclinical CVD as a critical focus of subsequent fall prevention strategies. Furthermore, our proposal will
provide definitive evidence as to whether one fall intervention, vitamin D3 supplementation, reduces subclinical
CVD. Together these aims will inform future intervention studies focused on subclinical CVD to prevent
orthostatic hypotension and prevent falls in older adults.","Project Narrative
Despite a high incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD), concerns about orthostatic hypotension often
discourage health providers from treating CVD risk factors in older adults. Based on our prior work, our
proposal tests the hypothesis that subclinical CVD itself is a direct contributor to orthostatic hypotension and
that vitamin D3 supplementation prevents falls by reducing subclinical CVD. By measuring high sensitivity
cardiac troponin I (a highly sensitive marker of subclinical cardiac injury) and N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic
peptide (a highly sensitive marker of cardiac wall strain) in stored serum from a large, NIA-funded trial on falls
in older adults, our proposal has the potential to rewrite the discourse surrounding CVD treatment in older
adults and establish CVD as a new target for future fall interventions.",

a natural outgrowth of the applicant's current work. Despite aggressive traditional risk factor modification and
glycemic control efforts with even the most recent glycemic control agents with favorable cardiovascular profiles,
atherosclerotic vascular diseases and microvascular disease continue to disproportionately impact individuals
with diabetes mellitus (DM). Vascular disease in T2DM begins with the development of vascular endothelial
dysfunction. The applicant's group recently reported that once daily supplementation with Lp299v results in
improved endothelial function and reduced systemic vascular inflammation in men with stable coronary artery
disease. This was the first report of a probiotic supplement having a favorable impact on vascular endothelial
function in humans. While this data supports the concept that Lp299v improves vascular endothelial function and
reduces systemic inflammation, only three individuals in the pilot study had T2DM. Whether the favorable effects
of Lp299v supplementation extend to humans with T2DM remains uncertain. Equipose regarding impact of
Lp299v supplementation in human T2DM is further supported by the known significant differences in the

microbiota with Lp299v may significantly differ compared to those without diabetes. The applicant's preliminary
data suggest Lp299v's favorable impact on endothelium-dependent vasodilation and vascular inflammation may
be magnified in individuals with T2DM. We will test the hypothesis that Lp299v supplementation improves
endothelium-dependent vasodilation and microvascular function, reduces inflammation, and improves insulin
sensitivity in humans with T2DM in the setting of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover

United States military Veterans from recent conflicts are coping with symptoms related to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Many Veterans are resistant to conventional health and mental health interventions (e.g., medication, psychotherapy), and often symptoms are not significantly improved by traditional treatments. Alternative treatment methods are needed. An underlying feature of PTSD is exaggerated inflammation, both peripherally and in the central nervous system, which is thought to play an important role in the vulnerability to, aggravation of, and perpetuation of adverse consequences of this condition. Therefore, an innovative intervention strategy would be the use of anti-inflammatory/immunoregulatory probiotics to reduce inflammation. In this study, we will investigate the effects of an 8-week oral administration of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG; ATCC53103), a probiotic shown to have anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory effects on both biological signatures of systemic inflammatory processes and proximal signatures of probiotic administration. LGG is a commensal organism that colonizes the human gut mucosa and suppresses mucosal inflammation via inhibition of the production of proinflammatory cytokines. The specific aim of the study is to identify the effect of probiotics on systemic inflammation, as well as PTSD symptoms, microbiota composition, gut permeability, stress response, and decision-making. Outcomes will be assessed using a longitudinal, double blind, randomized placebo-controlled design. After initial evaluation procedures to confirm PTSD and Functional Bowel Disorder diagnoses, 59 participants will be randomized to probiotic supplementation and 59 will be randomized to placebo supplementation. The proposed line of research addresses the NIH funding opportunity purpose, “to accelerate translational and clinical Phase IIa” trials regarding “probiotic[s]” to increase “understanding regarding underlying mechanisms of their action(s), and variability in responses to these interventions”.

Our preliminary data in 20 men with coronary artery disease (CAD) suggest that probiotic supplementation with
Lp299v has a strong and favorable impact on the vascular endothelium and a strong anti-inflammatory effect
on inflammatory cells critical to the development of endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. Our
preliminary data suggest obese CAD patients derive the greatest benefit, but whether the favorable impact of
Lp299v supplementation systematically differs in women or in obese humans with CAD remains unknown and
will be the foci of Aims 1 and 2. Our preliminary data also show improved endothelium dependent vasodilation
and reduced systemic inflammation occur concomitantly with changes in the concentrations of circulating
short-chain fatty acid (SCFAs)– known systemic metabolic products of the gut microbiota. In animal models,
SCFAs cause endothelium-dependent vasodilation by activating G protein-coupled receptor 41 (FFAR3).
Whether this novel mechanism is relevant in humans with CAD remains unknown. Our preliminary data shows
Lp299v supplementation increases circulating propionate, a three-carbon SCFA. Additionally, post-
supplementation plasma reversed impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation in resistance arteries from
CAD patients in an eNOS- and FFAR3-dependent manner. FFAR3's role in endothelium-dependent
vasodilation responses to Lp299v is a focus of in Aim 2. In Aim 3, we will test whether Lp299v
supplementation reduces pro-inflammatory signaling in human mononuclear cells known to contribute to
atherosclerosis formation and disease activity and whether FFAR3 activity is involved in this effect. The
application employs an innovative mix of translational investigations. We combine a randomized clinical trial to
study sex- and BMI-specific effects of Lp299v on vascular function using brachial artery ultrasound with critical
molecular and pharmacological studies targeting FFAR3 expression and activity in intact human vessels and
mononuclear cells. Additionally, we will employ innovative plasma-induced transcription studies and pathway
analyses to determine the impact of supplementation on whole genome transcription in human mononuclear
cells [lymphocytes (T-cell, B-cell, and NK cells) and monocytes] to determine how Lp299v impacts key
regulatory pathways involved in human vascular inflammation, atheroma formation, and plaque stability.","Recent human studies report an emerging, novel relationship between the gut microbiome and its metabolites
with the development of heart attacks and strokes. This application seeks to determine whether supplementation
with L. plantatum 299v can improve blood vessel function and reduce inflammation in both men and women as
well as obese and non-obese individuals and additionally determine if the favorable effects of L. plantarum 299v
are mediated through a novel receptor (FFAR3). Our findings would support the potential L. plantatum 299v to
improve cardiovascular health in humans.",

Maternal iron deficiency anemia (IDA) increases the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes and can negatively
impact the iron endowment of the neonate that may cause irreversible deleterious effects on neurodevelopment.
To avert IDA in pregnancy, women are universally prescribed a daily oral supplement containing ~27 mg of iron.
However, there is growing concern regarding the efficacy of this one-size-fits-all approach for women with
systemic inflammation, including women with obesity. Obese women experience disruption to the hepcidin-
ferroportin complex deeming iron from diet, including supplemental iron, and body stores less bioavailable. This
indicates an urgent need to develop and test new methods to prevent maternal IDA among women with obesity.
In this planning grant application, we will develop the clinical and research infrastructure to test the preliminary
efficacy of oral bovine lactoferrin (bLf) supplementation for the prevention of maternal IDA among obese women.
Lactoferrin is a natural compound found in secretions from mammals, including milk, and is an important
regulator of body iron balance given its effects on inflammation and the hepcidin-ferroportin complex. Daily oral
bLf has been shown to be superior to oral iron supplementation for treating IDA in pregnant women with
inflammation but has not been studied for its ability to prevent IDA in pregnancy. The specific aims of this clinical
trial planning grant include: 1) Establish the clinical and research infrastructure to recruit, enroll, and randomize
obese women at risk of IDA to an oral bLf intervention in pregnancy. In this aim we will establish, test, refine and
finalize the clinical and research infrastructure and implementation procedures, including a provider referral
system, real-time adherence monitoring, and data infrastructure; and 2) Pilot test a randomized controlled trial
of oral bLf supplementation from early second trimester up through delivery among 40 pregnant women with
obesity at risk of IDA. In this aim we seek to understand recruitment, adherence, and retention rates and
intervention acceptability to determine feasibility and preliminary efficacy on maternal inflammation and maternal
and neonatal iron and hematological-related markers. This study will provide first of its kind data, necessary and
sufficient to inform and develop a large-scale efficacy trial of oral bLf as a safe and scalable natural compound
for the prevention of IDA among obese women. Ultimately if successful, this project is an important first step
toward improving prenatal care for obese women who represent more than a third of reproductive-age women
in the United States.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Pregnant women in the U.S. are prescribed a daily prenatal supplement containing iron to prevent iron deficiency
anemia (IDA), a condition associated with adverse maternal and neonatal health. However, this one-size-fits-all
approach to preventing IDA may not be appropriate for women with inflammation, including obese women. We
propose to test oral lactoferrin along with a prenatal supplement devoid of iron in obese pregnant women to
assess whether it is feasible, acceptable, and potentially more effective at preventing IDA than a traditional daily
prenatal supplement containing iron.",

 More than 90% of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and cognitive impairment/dementia occur in men and
women >50 years of age. Changes in age demographics in the U.S. predict progressive increases in these
disorders without effective, evidence-based interventions. The age-related increase in systolic blood
pressure (SBP) is a major factor driving the increased risk of these disorders in later middle-aged and older
(MA/O) adults. This increase in SBP is due primarily to stiffening of the large elastic arteries, as indicated by
increased carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (CFPWV), which reflects stiffening of the aorta. Aortic
stiffening with aging is mediated by structural and functional (increased vascular smooth muscle tone)
changes in the arterial wall stimulated by oxidative stress and chronic low-grade inflammation.
 New BP guidelines describe a casual (resting) SBP of 120-129 mmHg as “elevated” and SBP of 130-139
mmHg as “stage 1 hypertension”, as these levels account for much of the increased risk of CVD and other
BP-influenced disorders of aging. Importantly, ~50% of adults age >50 have SBP within these ranges. The
first-line treatment for lowering SBP in these ranges is lifestyle-based therapy. In this context, we have shown
that caloric restriction (CR) reduces SBP and CFPWV in older mice and in overweight/obese MA/O humans,
but adherence is poor and CR reduces muscle and bone mass. As a result, we have since shown that
boosting NAD+ bioavailability to stimulate SIRT-1, a “CR mimetic” approach, reduces CFPWV and oxidative
stress in old mice, and we recently took the first step in translating these findings in a small pilot study of MA/O
adults (n=24). We found that supplementation with nicotinamide riboside, a natural, commercially available
precursor of NAD+ and novel CR mimetic, was well-tolerated and increased NAD+ bioavailability in the overall
group, and reduced SBP (-8 mmHg) and CFPWV in a subgroup (n=13) with baseline SBP of 120-139 mmHg.
 Here we propose a randomized, placebo controlled, double-blind, single-site phase IIa clinical trial to
assess the safety and efficacy of oral nicotinamide riboside (500 mg capsules 2x/day; NIAGEN®; ChromaDex
Inc.) for 3 months vs. placebo (n=59/group) for decreasing SBP and aortic stiffness in MA/O men and women
(50-79 years) with SBP in the elevated/stage 1 hypertension (120-139 mmHg) range. We hypothesize that
treatment will be safe and well-tolerated, and will reduce SBP and CFPWV, as related to increases in systemic
NAD+ bioavailability and reductions in vasoconstrictor factors, oxidative stress and inflammation.
Aim 1: To measure casual SBP (primary outcome) before/after nicotinamide riboside vs. placebo treatment;
Aim 2: To measure 24-hour ambulatory SBP and CFPWV (secondary outcomes) before and after treatment;
Aim 3: To determine the safety and tolerability of treatment with nicotinamide riboside vs. placebo;
Aim 4: To measure systemic NAD+ and NAD+–related metabolite concentrations, as well as circulating
 markers of vasoconstriction factors, oxidative stress and inflammation before and after treatment.","Project Narrative
Age-related increases in clinic and 24-hour systolic blood pressure (SBP) and arterial stiffness are strong
independent predictors of heart disease, stroke, cognitive impairments/dementia and other chronic disorders of
aging. This phase IIa clinical trial seeks to establish the safety and efficacy of nicotinamide riboside, a natural
supplement and novel alternative approach to mimicking the effects of sustained calorie restriction (i.e.,
“dieting”), for lowering clinic and 24-hour SBP and aortic stiffness in middle-aged and older adults with

The ultimate goal of this research is to develop a means to safely administer iron supplements to infants in

beneficial, protective gut microbiota by co-administration of prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) and iron-
sequestering bovine lactoferrin (bLF) during iron supplementation will prevent iron-induced increases of
opportunistic enteropathogens that cause infection and inflammation. The proposed research will extend our
established strategy of conjoining investigations in vivo with intestinal fermentation and cellular models in vitro.
We will conduct a randomized clinical trial in 6 month-old Kenyan infants in conjunction with mechanistic
microbiota studies using our established long-term continuous polyfermenter platform inoculated with
immobilized fecal microbiota from Kenyan infants. The period from about 6 months to 1 year of age is vital both
for iron nutrition and for the establishment of a healthy gut microbiome that promotes immune system
development, local immune homeostasis and limits pathogen colonization. Oral iron supplements are
associated with a significant 15% increase in the rate of diarrhea in children in malaria-endemic areas. Our
most recent studies have shown that prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) can provide partial amelioration
of the adverse effects of iron-induced dysbiosis by enhancing the growth of barrier populations of bifidobacteria
and lactobacilli. We hypothesize that the combination of prebiotic GOS with bovine lactoferrin (bLF), adding
iron sequestration, antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities, will provide virtually complete protection
against the adverse effects of added iron on the intestinal microbiota. Our research has two specific aims:
 (1) to conduct a randomized, controlled double-blind 9-month clinical trial in 6-month old Kenyan infants
 comparing the effects on gut microbiome composition among groups receiving in-home fortification
 for 6 months with micronutrient powders containing 5 mg iron (as sodium iron EDTA [2.5 mg] and
 ferrous fumarate [2.5 mg]) and (i) galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS; 7.5 g), (ii) bovine lactoferrin (bLF, 1.0
 g), (iii) GOS (7.5 g) and bLF (1.0 g), and (iv) no GOS or bLF. Each infant will then be followed for an
 additional 3 months to determine the longer-term effects of the treatments.
 (2) to examine mechanisms of prebiotic GOS and iron-sequestering bLF on microbiota composition,
 enteropathogen development, microbiota functions and metabolic activity, and inflammatory potential

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy 2 (TACT2) is to perform a pragmatic and efficient replication of TACT1 in patients with diabetes and a prior heart attack. The results of this trial will determine whether disodium ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (Na2EDTA) chelation therapy receives approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is subsequently accepted to reduce the risk of major adverse events from coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with diabetes.

Surprisingly to cardiologists, the chelation strategy,  combination of up to 40 infusions with intravenous disodium EDTA plus oral multivitamins and multiminerals (OMVM) compared with intravenous and oral placebo, led to a significant reduction in the time to first recurrent cardiovascular event in patients with prior myocardial infarction (MI), age 50 or older, already treated with standard evidence based medical therapies (HR 0.74; 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.57- 0.95; p=0.016.

In the prespecified subgroup with diabetes (n=633), the results were dramatic: the chelation-based strategy reduced the composite primary clinical endpoint by 51% (HR 0.49, 95%CI (0.33 0.75); p<0.001, 5-year NNT 5.5) and reduced total mortality by 43% (p=0.011, 5-year NNT 12). As a result of these findings, and because of the public health impact of cardiovascular disease and of diabetes, we have been encouraged by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the FDA to confirm the results of TACT1. The three Specific Aims of TACT2 are: 1) To determine if the chelation-based strategy in patients with diabetes and prior MI improves event-free survival; 2) To determine if the chelation-based strategy in patients with diabetes and prior MI reduces mortality; 3) To perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of the TACT2 chelation strategy. TACT2 will enroll 1200 diabetic patients 50 years of age or older with a prior MI and a serum creatinine of 2.0 mg/dL or less. Patients will be randomly allocated (1:1) to receive either chelation + OMVM or double placebo and followed for clinical events until the end of the 5 year trial. The primary endpoint will be a composite of all-cause mortality, recurrent
MI, stroke, coronary revascularization, and hospitalization for unstable angina. A Clinical Events Committee masked to treatment assignment will adjudicate events. Principal secondary endpoints will include: (1) all-cause mortality; (2) a composite of cardiovascular mortality, recurrent MI, or stroke; and (3) safety.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of the Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy 2 (TACT2) is to perform a pragmatic and efficient replication of TACT1 in patients with diabetes and a prior heart attack. The results of TACT2 will determine whether disodium ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (Na2EDTA) chelation therapy receives approval from the US Food and Drug Administration and is subsequently accepted to reduce the risk of major adverse events from coronary artery disease in patients with diabetes.

whose mothers participated in a randomized control trial providing lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNS) to
pregnant women from ≤ 20 weeks of gestation through 6 months postpartum and to their children from age 6 to

had fewer social-emotional difficulties at age 4-6 years, with greater effects of LNS in children from
disadvantaged home environments, suggesting that early supplementation buffered the effect of a
disadvantaged environment on the development of social-emotional difficulties in this sample, in which a high

Elevated circulating levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), increased serum phosphate, and anemia are
associated with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), cardiovascular disease (CVD), and chronic kidney disease
(CKD) progression in children. Current treatment strategies for CKD-mineral bone disorder and CKD-related
anemia include 1,25D, binders, iron, and erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESA). However, 1,25D therapy
further increases circulating and bone FGF23 levels, and iron deficiency and ESA treatment both also
stimulate FGF23 production. A novel paradigm in earlier CKD has been suggested with the use of phosphate
binders with or without an inhibitor of enteral phosphate absorption, when serum phosphate levels are
within the normal range, to lower FGF23 and to raise endogenous 1,25D levels. However, such approach led
to inconsistent results. Therapy with ferric citrate (FC), on the other hand, has been shown consistently to
lower FGF23 and phosphate levels while improving indices of iron metabolism in adults with CKD stages 3-4.
Furthermore, FC decreased serum phosphate levels, improved iron parameters and was well tolerated in
pediatric dialysis patients. Thus, FC may have added value especially for children with pre-dialysis CKD in
whom iron deficiency anemia and elevated FGF23 levels are highly prevalent. Moreover, iron deficiency is a
potent driver of FGF23 production. Therefore, we hypothesize that treatment with FC will lower intact FGF23
levels during a 12-month period in a randomized, double-blinded, two -arms parallel study in 160 pediatric
patients with CKD stages 3-4 and normal serum phosphate levels. The multi-site trial will pursue the following
specific aims: Specific Aim 1: To determine the efficacy of FC to lower serum intact FGF23 levels (primary
endpoint) in pediatric patients with CKD 3–4 over 12 months. Specific Aim 2: To determine the effects of the
interventions on anemia, kidney function, and indices of bone and mineral metabolism (secondary end-points).
Additionally, we will perform pre- and post-treatment bone biopsies to assess bone histomorphometry and
FGF23 expression in a sub-cohort of 24 UCLA patients. Specific Aim 3: To determine the safety and
tolerability of FC in pediatric CKD 3-4 patients. If our hypothesis is confirmed, then a new treatment paradigm
would emerge in which therapy with FC will be initiated early in CKD, when patients are normophosphatemic,
slowing progressive increases in FGF23 and blunting FGF23-associated adverse renal and CVD.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) levels are elevated in early stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in
children and they are associated with CKD progression and cardiovascular disease. Thus, strategies that lower
or limit the rise of FGF23 may lead to a new paradigm for the treatment of CKD-Mineral Bone Disorder. Thus,
early intervention that focuses on control of FGF23 may lead to correcting 1,25D deficiency with replacement
therapy that is associated with further rise in FGF23 levels.",

and Alzheimer's Disease compared to adults without overweight or obesity. However, research on nutritional
interventions to support cognitive health has been fragmented, and largely restricted to testing individual nutrition
factors or generally healthy dietary patterns. The overarching goal of this proposal, responding to PAR-18-877,
is to identify effective nutrition-based interventions to improve cognitive and brain functioning in older adults with
overweight and obesity. Our central hypothesis is that age-sensitive cognitive functions and cerebral blood flow
(CBF, an important biomarker of brain health) can be significantly increased in older adults with overweight or
obesity by consumption of a novel multiple-component nutrition supplement (MCNS) used alone or in
combination with a behavioral weight loss (WL) intervention. The scientific premise is that older adults with
overweight and obesity have pathophysiological changes in the brain secondary to excess weight that damage
brain structure and function, and as a result are particularly susceptible to nutritional deficiencies and oxidative
stress; thus, optimal nutritional interventions for cognitive health should provide a comprehensive panel of
nutrients and other food constituents to support structural and functional remodeling while reducing inflammation
and oxidative damage. The project is proposed by a multidisciplinary team with expertise in all aspects of the
research. The conceptual basis of the work is supported by our recent compelling data demonstrating
effectiveness of a MCNS for improving executive function and cerebral blood flow in young children, which is a
landmark advance because less comprehensive supplement formulations have been found to be ineffective.
 A 1-year randomized placebo-controlled trial will be conducted in 268 older adults with overweight and
obesity, low intakes of target nutrients, and normal cognition or mild cognitive impairment. A 2x2 factorial design
will randomize participants to: i) a MCNS supplement containing flavanols including epicatechin and catechin,
essential micronutrients and omega-3 fatty acids, or to an isocaloric placebo; and b) to receive a behavioral WL
intervention or an attentional Control. The primary outcome will be change in a composite cognitive z-score of
well-established standardized scores on 5 neuropsychological tests. We hypothesize improved cognitive
function in participants randomized to MCNS, WL and MCNS+WL compared to Controls, with greatest mean
benefits in MCNS+WL participants. The primary analysis is intention-to-treat. Linear mixed-effects models will
be applied to assess the effects of MCNS, WL, and MCNS+WL vs. Control and MCNS+WL vs. MCNS and WL
alone. Additional cognitive tests will be drawn for other reliable sources, and microvascular cerebral blood flow
and macrovascular cerebral blood flow velocity will be measured using diffuse correlation spectroscopy and
transcranial Doppler ultrasound. This research will identify practical nutrition-based interventions for improving
cognitive health in vulnerable older adults to support transformational advances in public health initiatives.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

The human diet can positively or negatively impact cancer incidence, with plant-derived compounds – such as
polyphenols – often exhibiting antioxidant cancer-preventive properties. Walnuts are an exceptional source of
polyphenolic ellagitannins (ETs) that are converted to ellagic acid and various urolithins by gut microbiota in the
colon. Urolithin A (UroA) is of particular interest for its potent anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, and prebiotic
activities. However, UroA production in individuals can vary significantly, likely based on differences in gut
microbiota. We will substantiate the anti-cancer benefits of a prebiotic/probiotic complex derived from consuming
walnuts and determine the basis of human inter-individual variability in UroA formation.
 Our overall hypothesis is that walnut supplementation improves colonic health and lowers colorectal cancer
(CRC) risk through UroA formation. This leads to several working hypotheses guiding our Aims: Working
Hypothesis 1. UroA producers are at a lower risk of having an advanced colonic lesion; Working Hypothesis 2.
Walnut supplementation will increase urinary UroA levels; and Working Hypothesis 3. CRC prevention by
walnuts will be greater in UroA-producers than in non-producers. In Aim 1, we propose a randomized, controlled
crossover trial in 69 patients (45-75 y) to examine walnut effects on CRC risk factors. We will associate an
individual's ability to produce UroA with biomarkers of inflammation and CRC risk, and identify the bacterial
species responsible for urolithin metabolism. In Aim 2, we will investigate prebiotic effects of ET-containing
walnuts in two conditional mouse CRC models, focusing on important processes in CRC and inflammation,
including bile acid metabolism, inflammation, and short chain fatty acid production. In Aim 3, we will test the
probiotic effects of human UroA-producing microbiota in a mouse fecal microbiota transplant (MT) study and
demonstrate a causal role for specific microbes in UroA formation. This will enable us to validate the concept that
important protective effects of walnuts and other ET-rich foods occur through specific microbiota-derived
metabolites. This will also define biomarkers and probiotics that highlight the benefits of these foods. Our
approach incorporates personalized nutrition with a focus on UroA producers and non-producers in colonic
health. Ultimately, our human and pre-clinical mouse studies may lead to prebiotics and probiotics that increase
protective urolithins for CRC prevention. These highly significant studies will test the ability of the microbiota to
generate colonic mucosa-protective agents (e.g., UroA). It is possible that high-risk patients can be efficiently
converted to a protective state by taking probiotics to realize the full benefits of ET-rich foods.","NARRATIVE

Risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) is significantly elevated in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD);
however, this increased risk is only partially explained by traditional CV risk factors. Arterial dysfunction is an
important nontraditional CV risk factor gaining increased recognition in the field of nephrology. While many
changes likely contribute to the development of arterial dysfunction in patients with CKD, among those of
greatest concern is the development of stiffening of the large elastic arteries. This process is best represented,
both physiologically and pathophysiologically, by increases in the gold standard measure of arterial stiffening,
carotid to femoral artery pulse wave velocity (CFPWV), which reflects, in particular, increases in aortic
stiffness. Aortic stiffening with CKD is mediated by structural and functional (increased vascular smooth
muscle tone) changes in the arterial wall stimulated by oxidative stress and chronic low-grade
inflammation. Caloric restriction (CR) is a promising strategy for prevention of CKD-associated arterial
dysfunction and CVD. In this context, we have shown that CR reduces CFPWV and SBP in older mice and in
overweight/obese middle-age and older adults. However, long-term adherence to chronic CR regimens with
optimal nutrition is very difficult to achieve and unlikely to become clinically relevant in the near future as it may
reduce muscle and bone mass. As a result, we have since shown that boosting NAD+ bioavailability to
stimulate SIRT-1, a “CR mimetic” approach, reduces CFPW and oxidative stress in old mice, and we recently
took the first step in translating these findings in a study of middle-age and older adults with normal kidney
function and elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP). We found that supplementation with nicotinamide
riboside, a natural, commercially available precursor of NAD+ and novel CR mimetic, was well tolerated and
increased NAD+ bioavailability and reduced CFPWV and SBP. Here we propose a randomized, placebo-
controlled, double-blind, single-site phase IIa clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of oral
nicotinamide riboside (500 mg capsules 2x/day; NIAGEN®; ChromaDex Inc.) for 3 months vs. placebo
(n=59/group) for decreasing aortic stiffness and SBP in men and women (35-80 years) with stage III and IV
CKD. We hypothesize that treatment will be safe and well-tolerated, and will reduce CFPWV and SBP, as
related to increases in systemic NAD+ bioavailability and reductions in oxidative stress, inflammation and
vasoconstrictor factors.
Aim 1: To measure CFPWV (primary outcome) before/after nicotinamide riboside vs. placebo treatment;
Aim 2: To measure casual and 24h-ambulatory SBP (secondary outcome) before and after treatment;
Aim 3: To determine the safety and tolerability of treatment with nicotinamide riboside vs. placebo;
Aim 4: To measure systemic NAD+ and NAD+–related metabolite concentrations, as well as circulating
markers of oxidative stress, inflammation, and vasoconstriction factors before and after treatment.","Project Narrative
The proposed research will determine the effectiveness of nicotinamide riboside, a natural supplement and
novel alternative approach to mimic the effects of sustained calorie restriction (i.e., “dieting”) for improving the
health and function of arteries in adults with moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease. The research also
will study the effects on clinic and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure and will provide insight into how
nicotinamide riboside improves artery health by assessing novel physiological mechanisms (biological
reasons) involved. Overall, the proposed research will provide important new scientific evidence on the
effectiveness of mimicking calorie restriction for reducing risk of cardiovascular disease in people with chronic

There are high prevalences of osteoporotic fractures and vitamin D deficiency in the U.S., especially among
older adults. Although vitamin D supplements are widely used to improve bone health, evidence for a role of
supplemental vitamin D alone in reducing fractures is lacking. While the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]
level is considered the best analyte to assess vitamin D status, currently there is no consensus on the optimal
circulating total 25(OH)D concentration for bone. While, like many hormones, vitamin D circulates bound to
proteins, the relative importance of free 25(OH)D (FVD) or bioavailable 25(OH)D levels on fracture risk is not
known. New advances in technology make it possible to directly measure the biologically active, FVD level.
Results from recent observational studies on whether FVD and/or bioavailable 25(OH)D are more strongly
associated than total 25(OH)D levels with calcium homeostasis and bone mineral density (BMD) are
inconsistent. In addition, there are no data from large, randomized controlled trials on whether bioavailable
25(OH)D and/or FVD vs. total 25(OH)D levels or gene variations in vitamin D-related pathways modify effects
of supplemental vitamin D on fractures and changes in BMD. To fill gaps in knowledge, we propose an
ancillary study to the large, NIH-sponsored, randomized, controlled VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL)
that is testing effects of supplemental vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol, 2000 IU/d), and/or omega-3 fatty acids (fish
oil, 1 g/d) in the primary prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease in 25,874 U.S. men (aged ≥50) and
women (aged ≥55), including 5,107 African Americans. The proposed ancillary study will definitively determine
whether supplemental, high-dose, vitamin D3 alone reduces incident total, non-vertebral and hip fractures by
extending adjudication of fractures to the full 5 years of treatment in 25,874 VITAL participants nationwide. The
proposed studies will also rigorously test whether concentrations of bioavailable 25(OH)D and/or FVD are
more strongly associated with changes in BMD and incident fractures than total 25(OH)D levels; and whether
these vitamin D biomarkers and genetic variants in vitamin D-related pathways modify effects of supplemental
vitamin D on BMD and fracture risk. For each of the proposed aims, we will assess whether results vary by (a)
sex, (b) race/ethnicity, and (c) BMI. Key VITAL resources will be leveraged at no additional cost to the
proposed studies including: blood samples and BMD measurements (at baseline and follow-up), extensive
data on changes in 25(OH)D levels over time (in the treatment vs. placebo arms), measures of calcium
homeostasis, information on clinical risk factors, and extracted DNA. This proposal provides a unique and cost-
efficient opportunity to generate important positive or informative negative results about effects of supplemental
vitamin D3 alone on fracture risk, while also elucidating the relative importance of vitamin D biomarkers and
genetic variations in vitamin D-related pathways on bone. Findings from the proposed ancillary study have the
potential for major clinical as well as public health impact for both men and women in the U.S.","NARRATIVE
Vitamin D supplements are widely promoted for bone health, but definitive data on benefits and risks of high-

Falls and decreased physical function increase markedly with age and result in injury, hospitalization, and
death. Safe, cost-effective primary prevention strategies are needed to reduce these adverse outcomes in the
aging U.S. population. Basic, preclinical, and clinical studies suggest that flavanols, a class of nutrients present
in high concentrations in cocoa, have favorable effects on muscle and physical performance. Flavanols
decrease oxidative stress and improve biomarkers of mitochondrial biogenesis and muscle growth. Emerging
studies show potential benefits of supplemental cocoa flavanols on physical performance, including grip
strength and walking speed in older adults. However, there are no large, long-term randomized controlled trials
(RCTs) of the effects of supplemental flavanols on falls, muscle performance, and/or fall-related injuries. In an
ancillary study to the COcoa Supplement and Multivitamins Outcomes Study (COSMOS), which is testing the
effects of supplemental cocoa flavanols and/or multivitamin for the prevention of cardiovascular disease and
cancer, we propose the first large, placebo-controlled, prospective study to determine whether supplemental
flavanols reduce falls and improve musculoskeletal health in women aged ≥ 65 and men aged ≥ 60. In the
proposed study, we will determine effects of a cocoa flavanol supplement [600 mg/d flavanols, including 80 mg
(-)- epicatechins] and/or multivitamin on the following clinically meaningful outcomes: falls in the overall
COSMOS cohort (n=21,444) and physical performance in a clinic sub-cohort (n=603). We will test the following
hypotheses: Aim 1: In the overall COSMOS cohort, cocoa flavanol supplementation will reduce risk of: (a)
injurious fall(s) resulting in a visit to a healthcare provider or hospital with medical record review and (b) two or
more falls per year and (c) injurious fall(s) (not resulting in healthcare utilization) as assessed by annual
questionnaires. Aim 2: In the clinic sub-cohort, cocoa flavanol supplementation will benefit physical
performance measures at 2-year post randomization, as assessed by grip strength, walking speed, and Short
Physical Performance Battery (a composite of standing balance, walking speed, and chair stands). Aim 3: In
the overall COSMOS cohort, cocoa flavanol supplementation reduces incident fractures as assessed by
annual questionnaires. We will explore whether effects of cocoa flavanols on fracture outcomes are mediated
through falls and/or bone density changes. In exploratory aims we will also assess effects of multivitamins on
these same outcomes. RCTs testing effects of multivitamins on falls and musculoskeletal outcomes are
lacking. This ancillary study maximizes cost-efficiency to fill gaps in knowledge regarding effects of flavanols
for the primary prevention of falls. We expect the proposed, rigorous translational study will elucidate whether
supplemental flavanols improve musculoskeletal health and prevent falls and declining physical performance in
the increasing number of older adults in the U.S. with potential for clinical and public health benefits.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Cocoa products, containing high concentrations of flavanols, are widely used and their health benefits have
received increasing attention in the medical literature. Promising results from preclinical and clinical studies

adults. This study will determine whether supplemental cocoa flavanols slow age-related declines in physical
performance and decrease falls and fall-related fractures (broken bones) that are major public health problems
in older women and men in the U.S.",

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) arises through T-cell mediated killing of the pancreatic beta-cells. It has a strong
genetic component, but environmental factors likely influence disease triggering as well as the post-onset
disease course. In human T1D families, we have identified an elevated inflammatory state that is consistent
with exposure to microbial antigens. In healthy siblings of probands, this familial innate inflammation is
supplanted by an age-dependent regulatory state that includes temporal increases in peripheral activated
regulatory T-cell frequencies. We have identified a similar inflammatory state in the BioBreeding DR rat model
of T1D. DR rats are not spontaneously diabetic, however T1D can be triggered in young animals by viral
infection. Importantly, the innate inflammatory state in DR rats is temporally supplanted by an IL-10/TGF-β-
mediated regulatory state that coincides with the inability of virus to induce T1D in older animals. In line with
studies that implicate an altered gastrointestinal microbiota in T1D pathogenesis, modulation of the microbiota
in healthy siblings of T1D probands or DR rats partially normalizes the underlying inflammatory state. In
BioBreeding rats, such treatments prevent development of T1D. Our studies suggest that T1D progression is
promoted when the genetically controlled but environmentally influenced familial innate state is augmented by
additional inflammatory signals prior to the establishment of robust counter-regulatory mechanisms. Our
studies have also focused on the persistence of insulin secretion after T1D onset, which is clinically significant
as even modest residual beta cell function is associated with reduced risk of complications. These studies
have utilized a plasma-based transcriptional bioassay that quantitatively captures inflammatory: regulatory
balance. Importantly, new onset T1D patients with short post-onset partial remissions, exhibit plasma based
signatures with predictively higher inflammatory bias, as well as reduced peripheral regulatory T-cell
abundances. In genetically susceptible healthy subjects and T1D patients, we hypothesize
that levels of immune activity are in part governed by composition of the microbiota and systemic microbial
antigen exposure. This in turn influences the rate of T1D progression as measured by duration of the post-
onset partial remission. With our large patient population and expertise, we are well-positioned to test the
hypothesis that the inflammatory state associated with T1D and T1D susceptibility can be partially normalized
through probiotic supplementation. We propose the following specific aims.
1. Determine whether Lactobacillus plantarum 299v supplement reduces systemic inflammation and
prolongs residual β-cell function in new onset T1D.
2. Define how L. plantarum 299v supplementation alters immune activity in new onset T1D.","Project Narrative

One in four people with HIV (PWH) report hazardous drinking [i.e., >7 (14) drinks per week or >3 (4) drinks per
occasion for women (men)]. Of this population, 65% report depressive symptoms or smoking, and 21% report
all three- constituting an alcohol-associated syndemic (i.e., interaction of 2+ conditions to increase risk for poor
outcomes). This syndemic is associated with increased risk of incident cardiovascular disease (CVD). The
gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome is a strong candidate mechanistic pathway for the syndemic-related excess
CVD risk, through GI dysbiosis, microbial translocation (MT), and systemic inflammation. Dysbiosis is
characterized as a decrease in beneficial bacteria and increase in pro-inflammatory bacteria. GI dysbiosis
leads to MT, in which tight junctions of the GI lumen are compromised, driving systemic inflammation- a
leading cause of CVD. HIV, hazardous drinking, smoking and depression are independently associated with GI
dysbiosis, MT and inflammation. Beneficial butyrate producing bacteria, which downregulate pro-inflammatory
mediators, are depleted in hazardous drinking PWH. In humans with alcohol use disorder, probiotic use
attenuates MT and inflammation. Among PWH, probiotic (e.g., butyrate producing bacteria) with prebiotic use
(nutrients for bacterial growth), a combination known as “synbiotic”, favorably alters the GI microbiome within
4-16 weeks. We hypothesize that the alcohol-associated syndemic is associated with GI dysbiosis and
subsequent CVD related biomarkers and that targeted supplementation may restore GI microbiome
homeostasis and reduce inflammation. With a transdisciplinary mentoring panel at Vanderbilt University
Medical Center (VUMC), my career development plan will advance skills in clinical investigation of alcohol
syndemic phenotypes; microbiome structure, function, diversity and immunology; clinical & translational
research; and primary data collection, responsible conduct of research, and leadership. Aim 1 will identify
changes in the GI microbiome among PWH with the alcohol-associated syndemic over 12 months, Aim 2 will
determine changes in biomarker profiles related to GI permeability, MT, and inflammation among PWH with the
alcohol-associated syndemic over 12 months, and Aim 3 will evaluate the a) feasibility of administering a
butyrate supplement pill followed by a multi-strain synbiotic (prebiotic + probiotic) pill and b) treatment effects
on GI microbiome structures and CVD-related biomarkers among PWH with the alcohol-associated syndemic
(n=40). Aims 1 & 2 leverage secondary data from an NIAAA-funded microbiome study of 200 PWH with
existing GI microbiome data, sero-biomarker data, and validated self-reports of alcohol use, smoking, and
depressive symptoms. Aim 3 utilizes the infrastructure of the Tennessee Center for AIDS Research at VUMC,
which has a strong record of supporting Early Career Faculty. This award will facilitate my transition to an
independent investigator with expertise in alcohol/CVD epidemiology, microbiome structure and function, and
clinical trial development among PWH, and will also provide informative data for an R01 application.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

Patients undergoing surgery to treat their bladder cancer face very high rates of complications and mortality.
The radical cystectomy operation is fraught with the highest complication rates of all urologic oncology
surgeries performed and is also extremely catabolic. As the National Cancer Institute has identified in its
provocative questions 2 & 11, variations in immune function and nutritional interventions affect the
response to cancer treatment. Radical cystectomy will continue to save lives, but there is a high cost in terms
of persistent surgical complications. The long-term goal of this project is to unlock the potential of nutrition
interventions to improve outcomes, survival, and quality of life in cancer patients. The objective of this project
is to determine the impact of a specialized form of nutritional support on surgical outcomes and to better
understand the mechanisms by which it acts. The hypothesis is that perioperative use of a specialized form of
nutritional support will have greater efficacy than a standard form of nutritional support to reduce post-
operative complications. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of published preliminary data
produced in the applicants' laboratories and expert guidelines calling for more rigorous study of this
approach. The rationale is that Specialized IMmunonutrition (SIM) is fortified with nutrients (L-arginine,
omega-3 fatty acids, dietary nucleotides, and vitamin A) that have immediate effects on immune and
inflammatory responses, muscle sparing, and wound healing after surgery. Guided by strong preliminary
data, the hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: 1) To determine the impact of perioperative SIM
versus an identical Oral Nutrition Support (ONS) lacking the immuno-modulators on post-operative
complications from RC; 2) To compare the impact of SIM to ONS on secondary clinical outcomes after RC
surgery; 3) To evaluate the impact of consuming SIM compared to ONS for restraining myeloid-derived
suppressor cells (MDSCs), decreasing inflammation, and modulating nutrient metabolism. The project is
significant because it offers a high yield, low-risk, low-cost strategy to improve the outcome of patients with
bladder cancer who undergo RC. Our innovative approach could transform clinical practice to reduce post-
operative complications, thereby diminishing the burden of bladder cancer surgery and has the added
potential to help many other surgical patients beyond cystectomy.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
The ultimate goal of this research is to unlock the potential of nutrition interventions to improve outcomes,

Although the adverse effects associated with prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) are well known, many women
continue to drink heavily during pregnancy, putting their infants at risk for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.
Given the limited effectiveness of psychosocial and informational interventions, there is a growing interest in
new approaches, such as nutritional interventions, that may be more effective. Animal studies have shown that
choline supplementation during the equivalent of the 3rd trimester in humans can mitigate effects of PAE on
growth and development. However, findings from studies in humans to date have been inconsistent and
difficult to interpret. Choline, an essential nutrient, serves as a methyl-group donor for DNA methylation and is
a constituent of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and a precursor to major components of cell membranes. In
an R21 feasibility trial, 70 heavy drinkers were randomly assigned to receive a daily dose of 2g of choline or a
placebo from time of enrollment in antenatal care until delivery. Participants were recruited from the Cape
Coloured (mixed ancestry) community in Cape Town, South Africa, where the incidence of heavy drinking during
pregnancy and fetal alcohol syndrome are among the highest in the world. Infants in the choline-treated arm
were more likely to meet criterion for eyeblink conditioning than those in the placebo arm. Infants born to both
the choline- and placebo-treated mothers were small at birth, but those in the choline arm showed
considerable catch-up growth in weight and head circumference by 6.5 mo, which persisted through 12 mo. At
12 mo, infants in the choline arm showed markedly better recognition memory compared to placebo-treated on
the Fagan Test of Infant Intelligence, which is known to have predictive validity for school-age IQ. Key features
of this study included the higher choline dose (4.4 times adequate intake (AI), compared to 1.7-2.5 in previous
human studies) and initiation of treatment early in pregnancy. We propose to recruit heavy drinking pregnant
women from a rural Cape Coloured community to participate in a fully-powered, double-blind, randomized,
placebo-controlled choline supplementation trial (1) to assess the effectiveness of maternal choline
supplementation during pregnancy to mitigate effects of PAE on three primary outcomes: infant recognition
memory and postnatal growth restriction (weight and head circumference); (2) to assess the efficacy of this
supplementation for mitigating alcohol effects on the following secondary outcomes: infant eyeblink
conditioning, postnatal length, and information processing speed; (3) to use innovative methods from causal
inference analysis to examine protocol adherence as an important source of variation in treatment efficacy and
to identify socio-demographic factors associated with non-compliance in order to facilitate implementation of
the intervention protocol in clinical settings; and (4) in exploratory analyses, to examine whether maternal
choline supplementation is particularly effective in women with lower dietary choline intake or poor nutritional
status.

Given the limited effectiveness of informational and psychosocial interventions in addressing the
continuing major health risks associated with maternal heavy alcohol consumption and binge
drinking during pregnancy, there is growing interest in new approaches, such as nutritional
interventions, that may be more effective in reducing the risks associated with fetal alcohol

a high dose of the nutrient choline initiated early in pregnancy can be effective in mitigating a
range of adverse effects on growth and neurobehavioral function seen in FASD. The proposed

Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on
the host. One of the most common indications for probiotic treatment is the prevention of antibiotic-associated
diarrhea (AAD), but the efficacy of many probiotic products used for AAD is not supported by rigorous
independent research, often resulting in non-evidence-based usage. Our research group has been working
closely with the United States Food and Drug Administration to move research forward for the most well
studied Bifidobacterium strain, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (B. lactis) BB-12 (BB-12), via an
Investigational New Drug pathway. As part of this pathway, we previously conducted two Phase I, safety trials
and are currently conducting a Phase II clinical trial that examines efficacy and further monitors the safety of
BB-12 in preventing AAD under the parent award R01HD088428. To explore possible mechanisms
responsible for BB-12 effects in ameliorating AAD, we are also studying gut microbiota composition and
function by collecting fecal samples at multiple time points pre- and post- BB-12 administration.
The current trial, “A Phase II randomized controlled trial to evaluate the role of BB-12 in antibiotic-associated
diarrhea and its effects on the gut microbiome”, had successfully enrolled 205 children between the ages of 3-
12 years before the study was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We are requesting this supplement
to support unanticipated expenses due to these delays in order to reach our a priori recruitment goal of 300
participants. The specific aims and hypotheses of the current trial, which remain unchanged, are:
· Aim 1: To test the efficacy of high dose, BB-12-supplemented yogurt in preventing AAD, compared to
 yogurt without BB-12, in children receiving antibiotics.
 Hypothesis: Children receiving antibiotics who receive the yogurt with BB-12 will demonstrate less diarrhea
 than those receiving a control yogurt without BB-12.
· Aim 2: To assess the safety of yogurt supplemented with BB-12.
 Hypothesis: Yogurt containing BB-12 will be safe and well tolerated in this larger pediatric population. This
 is a Phase II trial that requires additional safety evaluation of high dose BB-12.
· Aim 3: To carry out longitudinal community structure and gene expression analysis of fecal microbiota to
 evaluate the impact of high dose BB-12 in a pediatric population receiving antibiotics.
 Hypotheses: (i) Administration of antibiotics will alter the composition and gene expression profile of the gut
microbiota in pediatric patients, and (ii) concomitant ingestion of BB-12 in yogurt will mitigate the antibiotic-
induced disturbance in the gut microbiota, as identified using 16S rRNA and metatranscriptomic profiling.
Our long-term goal is to determine the impact of BB-12 on a variety of gastrointestinal disease states and
ages, through high-level independent research. An administrative supplement will be critical to the continuation
and completion of this trial, and to the preservation of the overall impact of the project consistent with its
originally approved objectives.","Project Narrative

Stomach problems are common in children with autism. The proposed research project will
study children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), 4-15 years of age, who are complaining of
recurring gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, such as abdominal pain, constipation, and vomiting.
These gastrointestinal problems are often associated with abnormal behavior, such as
irritability. Our group is planning to test if at two different doses of a probiotic (defined as a
bacterial product which when consumed in adequate quantity improves health) can benefit
these children with GI symptoms. Oral doses of the probiotic we have selected (Lactobacillus
rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium lactis BB-12, BB-12+LGG) to be tested are: a straw with 2
billion colony forming units (CFUs), a straw with 10 billion CFUs, and a placebo straw. We plan
to enroll 70 eligible subjects with confirmed ASD and randomize them to placebo, low dose, and
high dose of BB-12+LGG once daily at 1:2:2 ratio. The probiotic, to be added to food, may
improve abdominal complaints which we hypothesize may produce changes in autistic behaviors
that accompany these GI symptoms.
Even though probiotics are widely available, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires
that we demonstrate that this particular combination probiotic is safe in children before we can
undertake a large multi-center trial to see if BB-12+LGG is effective at different doses in
children with ASD. Based on previous trials in adults and adolescents, we expect no serious side
effects from the use of BB-12+LGG. There will be 4 visits over 90 days. We expect to see a trend
toward improvement of autistic behavior and GI symptoms by the end of the 56 days of
treatment with BB-12+LGG at the highest dose. The pain and abnormal behaviors will be
recorded using validated questionnaires.
This study incorporates an Integrated Omics approach. Several blood and stool tests will be
tested as potentially useful biomarkers of intestinal health in ASD, including a test of gut
permeability (zonulin), a blood test for systemic inflammation (S100A9), and a stool test for
inflammation (calprotectin). We will concomitantly measure bacterial communities in the stool

nursing home (NH) residents. Thus, there is an urgent need for effective strategies to prevent PNA in elderly.
An important predisposing factor that may account for the higher incidence of PNA in older adults is the age-
associated decline in T cell function. Importantly, there are remarkable similarities between Zn deficiency and
age-induced changes in T cells. We have shown that 29% of NH residents have low serum Zn levels, which
was associated with higher incidence and duration of PNA, and antibiotic use. Although our preliminary data
strongly suggest that low serum Zn is an independent risk factor for PNA in the elderly, a controlled clinical trial
is critically needed to determine the efficacy of Zn supplementation in PNA prevention in this population. The
objective of the larger clinical trial that will pursue the studies proposed in this R34 is to determine the effects of
Zn supplementation on PNA outcomes in NH elderly and to understand their mechanistic basis. Our central
hypothesis is that improving Zn status in NH elderly with low serum Zn will reduce the incidence and duration
of PNA, and the frequency of antibiotic use, and that the effect of Zn is mediated mainly through the
improvement of T cell function and/or innate immunity. Our rationale for conducting the proposed clinical trial is
to determine the value of Zn supplementation as an inexpensive, easily implemented intervention that would
aid in the prevention of PNA in the elderly.
 In our previous study NH elderly with low serum Zn levels, who were supplemented with 30 mg/d of Zn and
½ RDA of essential micronutrients showed, on average, significantly improved serum Zn levels. However, only
58% of participant became serum Zn adequate. We therefore hypothesize that either a higher dose or a longer
duration of supplementation is required to achieve adequate serum Zn levels in all Zn deficient elderly. Our
rationale for conducting the proposed pilot study is to determine the most effective yet safe dose for Zn
supplementation in NH residents to be used in the larger clinical trial described above.
The Specific Aim of the proposed two-year, pilot study is to establish the optimal dose of supplemental Zn to
achieve adequate Zn status, and improved T cell function in Zn deficient elderly. We will accomplish this goal
by conducting a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial to test the efficacy of
supplementation with 30 or 60 mg/d of Zn for 12 months on serum and immune cell Zn levels, key measures of
T cell mediated and innate immunity, and adverse events. The findings of this proposal are scientifically
essential, yet sufficient, to allow us to make definitive decisions that inform the final design of our planned
clinical trial, which aims to establish the value of Zn supplementation as an inexpensive, easily implemented
intervention that would aid in the prevention of PNA, limit the duration of PNA, and consequently reduce the
need for antimicrobial therapy in the elderly.","Project Narrative

 Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common and devastating complication of critical
illness, and effective therapies to prevent ARDS are limited. Vitamin D metabolites have potent
immunomodulatory effects and attenuate acute organ injury in animal models. Randomized controlled trials
(RCTs) are ongoing to test whether vitamin D3 (vit D3) administration improves outcomes in critically ill patients
at risk of ARDS. However, due to the heterogeneous nature of critical illness, patient-specific factors likely play
a major role in determining response to vit D3. We will use a precision medicine approach to investigate the
clinical, genetic, and biochemical factors that determine response to vit D3 administration in critical illness.
 This proposal is an ancillary study to the NHLBI-funded Vitamin D to Improve Outcomes by Leveraging
Early Treatment (VIOLET) trial, an ongoing, multicenter RCT that is enrolling 3000 critically ill patients at high
risk of ARDS and death. Patients are randomly assigned to receive a single enteral dose of 540,000 I.U. of vit
D3 or placebo to test whether vit D3 reduces 90-day mortality and acute organ injury. VIOLET is archiving
plasma and DNA from all 3000 patients on day 0, and plasma on day 3 from the first 300 patients. We
propose to collect plasma on day 3 from an additional 500 patients (Aim 1) and to leverage existing samples
(Aims 2 and 3) to test the following hypotheses.
 In Aim 1 we will use paired plasma samples (n=400) from days 0 and 3 to investigate the clinical factors
that affect the pharmacokinetic response to vit D3 administration in critical illness. We will test whether greater
severity-of-illness (higher SOFA score), obesity, and acute or chronic liver or kidney disease attenuate
increases in plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25D) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D) levels from day 0 to 3 in
patients who receive vit D3. In Aim 2 we will investigate whether pre-specified common polymorphisms in
genes affecting vitamin D metabolism or in vitamin D target genes identify a patient population more likely to
benefit from vit D3 administration, assessed by 90-day mortality (primary endpoint) and acute organ injury
(secondary endpoint). In Aim 3, we will investigate whether lower plasma levels of fibroblast growth factor-23,
an osteocyte-derived hormone that inhibits the conversion of 25D to 1,25D, identify a patient population more
likely to benefit from vit D3 administration, assessed by 90-day mortality (primary endpoint) and acute organ
injury (secondary endpoint).
 Development of a precision medicine approach to vit D3 administration in critical illness could have
immediate and actionable clinical impact by helping to inform both clinical decision making and the design of
future trials of vitamin D metabolites in critical illness.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common and devastating complication of critical illness, and
effective therapies to prevent ARDS are limited. Vitamin D3 has emerged as a promising therapeutic agent to
prevent ARDS and death in critically ill patients. Here, we seek to develop a precision medicine approach to
vitamin D3 administration in critical illness, by determining patient-specific clinical, genetic, and biochemical
factors that identify patient populations most likely to benefit from vitamin D3 administration.",

Identification of dietary factors that delay decline in cognitive function has important implications for reducing
the burden of Alzheimer’s dementia (AD) and reducing health care costs as the population ages. Inadequate
intakes of vitamin K and vitamin D are common among the elderly, and there is growing evidence that both
nutrients have biological roles in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related pathologies, and
the risk of Alzheimer’s dementia. We demonstrated in the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) study that
higher postmortem brain levels of vitamin K and vitamin D were associated with better cognitive function prior
to death. Further investigation of neuropathologically-defined outcomes revealed that higher brain vitamin K
concentrations were associated with lower global AD pathology, specifically fewer neurofibrillary tangles, and
with lesser Lewy bodies (sine qua non of Parkinson’s disease and Lewy Body Dementia). There is now an
urgent need for additional research to clarify the biologic mechanism(s) underlying these cognitive protective
effects. Based on our collective prior research and exciting new research findings generated during the current
project period, we propose an overall goal to elucidate associations between Vitamin K and Vitamin D with
brain structure (neuropathology and neuroimaging outcomes) and brain function (cognitive and motor) in
older persons from two well-characterized community-based studies, MAP and the Rush Minority Aging
Research Study (MARS). Guided by strong preliminary data, this objective will be accomplished by pursuing
two aims: Specific Aim 1: Determine associations of Vitamin K and Vitamin D with MRI-derived indices of
white and gray matter tissue integrity and measures of brain neuropathology in: (a) postmortem brain samples;
and (b) antemortem blood samples; and Specific Aim 2: Determine the associations of brain vitamin K and
vitamin D with motor function and parkinsonian signs. The proposed approach is innovative because this highly
productive and multidisciplinary team will: (1) expand our brain structure outcomes to include neuroimaging
that leverage novel deep-learning approaches, in addition to neuropathologic outcomes, to determine if these
two vitamins are involved in changes in brain tissue integrity that occur in AD and related pathologies; (2)
expand brain function outcomes to include existing outcomes of motor function and parkinsonian signs, in
addition to cognitive outcomes, for novel insight into common mechanisms underlying age-related cognitive
and physical function declines; and (3) add African-American decedents with autopsies from MARS to enhance
generalizability of the findings. The proposed research is significant because intakes of these two nutrients,
which are generally below the recommended amounts in older persons, are modifiable, low-cost, and safe
when consumed in higher amounts. Successful completion of the proposed study will provide the foundation
for future studies on the impact of modifying vitamin K and/or vitamin D on AD risk.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
The proposed research is relevant to public health and NIA’s mission for the division of neuroscience as
understanding vitamin D and K’s role in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias of aging offers a potentially
important, novel, and low-cost intervention for populations at higher risk for dementia. A thorough analysis of
this relationship will ultimately allow researchers to clarify the forms of vitamin D and vitamin K important to
dementia and justify the conduct of future vitamin D and K supplementation trials.",

Cocoa products have become a widely consumed food, with growing demand across the world and steadily
increasing interest in its potential health benefits and anti-aging biology. However, the role of cocoa consumption
on epigenetic aging remains essentially unexplored. There has been compelling evidence for the anti-
inflammatory role of cocoa and cocoa-derived flavanols based upon in vitro and animal models. However, a
critical barrier of research progress remains the lack of definitive large-scale randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
Accelerated epigenetic aging that comprises DNA methylation changes has recently emerged as a powerful,
novel predictor for lifespan and health span, disease susceptibility, morbidity, and mortality risk. Further,
inflammaging is a highly significant risk factor for both morbidity and mortality in the elderly, as many age-related
diseases including cardiovascular disease (CVD) share an inflammatory pathogenesis. As such, interventions
to slow or mitigate epigenetic aging and inflammaging are critical for promoting healthy aging.
 The COcoa Supplement and Multivitamin Outcomes Study (COSMOS) is an ongoing randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled, 2x2 factorial RCT of a high-quality cocoa extract supplement (containing 600 mg/d
flavanols, including 80 mg epicatechins), and a multivitamin supplement to reduce the risk of CVD and cancer
in women aged ≥65 years and men aged ≥60 years. COSMOS has randomized 21,444 participants into the trial,
including 2,006 participants with bio-samples already collected at baseline, year 1 and year 2 follow-up.
COSMOS is the only large RCT testing the effects of cocoa extract in women and men, and for multivitamins in
women. Thus, this proposed ancillary study will build upon the parent COSMOS trial to examine the effects of
randomized cocoa or multivitamin supplementation on anti-aging (epigenetic aging and inflammaging) in 600
representative subjects with three bio-sample collections at baseline, year 1, and year 2, as well as measured
CVD risk factors, and examining these findings in the context of CVD outcomes. We will test our central
hypotheses that cocoa supplementation reduces epigenetic aging indices (e.g., AgeAccelHorvath,
AgeAccelHannum, AgeAccelGrim, AgeAccelPheno, and DNAmTLadjAge) and inflammaging (serum hsCRP, IL-
1β, IL-4, IL-6, and TNF-α) over time. We will also determine to what extent the effects of cocoa supplementation
on inflammaging and CVD risk factors are mediated by epigenetic aging.
 The purported anti-aging health benefits of cocoa-rich products such as dark chocolate have popularized and
increased consumption of cocoa-rich products over the past decade. Moreover, multivitamins remain the most
common dietary supplement taken by at least one-third of older US adults. It remains of critical public health
importance to rigorously test the anti-aging properties of these two supplements via large RCTs for more
definitive evidence of their potential efficacy, and to approve or refute their potential anti-aging benefits.","PROJECT NARRATIVE:RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH
Cocoa products have become a widely consumed food, with growing demand and increasing interest in its
anti-aging biology. While the popularity of cocoa consumption remains steady, enthusiasm has outpaced
the scientific evidence in humans. Thus, we propose to leverage the large-scale ongoing national
randomized clinical trial called COSMOS to evaluate the effect of cocoa supplementation on longitudinal
change in biological aging including epigenetic aging and inflammation aging in relation to cardiovascular
disease (CVD). Parallel assessments of the randomized multivitamin intervention on the same biological
aging and CVD outcomes will be also performed, as multivitamins have remained the most common
dietary supplement, taken by at least one-third of US adults. Thus, this study will not only provide valuable
insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms for the two popular supplements (cocoa and
multivitamin), but also holds great promise for targeting by nutritional interventions.",

Significant Public Health efforts have been made towards salt reduction but most have met with failure. Dietary
factors such high sodium/low potassium diets contribute to the development of cardiovascular diseases
(CVDs) such as atherosclerosis and high blood pressure (BP). This is important as CVD is the number one
killer in the U.S. While the role of these two nutrients on BP is widely accepted, their impact on the vasculature
has received less attention. Endothelial dysfunction, characterized by impaired dilation, is an important non-
traditional risk factor for atherosclerosis. We have shown that high sodium diets cause endothelial dysfunction,
independent of changes in BP (accomplished by testing adults with salt resistant BP). Evidence supporting
potassium's beneficial role on vascular health remains unclear although it may be more effective in the
presence of a high sodium diet. A purported mechanism responsible for sodium-induced vascular dysfunction
is overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulting in reduced nitric oxide (NO)
production/bioavailability. It has been suggested that potassium can counteract sodium's effects by reducing
ROS. Additionally, high sodium diets have been shown to stiffen the endothelium by increasing abundance of
the endothelial sodium channel (EnNaC) while potassium's role on EnNaC is unknown. Our central hypothesis
is that dietary potassium will protect the vasculature from sodium's harmful effect by preserving NO and
reducing oxidative stress and endothelial cell stiffness. We will use three 10-day diets to test our hypothesis
(controlled feeding study, crossover design, diet order sequence randomized with washout between diets). We
will compare a moderate potassium/high sodium diet (MK/HS; 65 mmol/300 mmol) to a high potassium/high
sodium (HK/HS;120 mmol/300 mmol) to assess potassium's protective effect on the vasculature during a fixed
sodium intake. We will also compare a moderate potassium/low sodium (MK/LS; 65 mmol/50 mmol) diet to the
MK/HS diet to individually confirm salt resistant BP status. Focusing on salt resistant adults allows us to isolate
the vascular effects, without the confound of changes in BP (i.e., independent of BP). Rigor will be enhanced
by utilizing twenty-four hour ambulatory BP and urine collections during each diet condition; men, women, and
minorities will be tested. Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation will be used to assess conduit endothelial-
dependent dilation. Cutaneous vasodilation in response to local heating using laser Doppler flowmetry coupled
with intradermal microdialysis will be used to assess microvascular function. Venous endothelial cells will be
collected for direct assessment of cell stiffness by atomic force microscopy and markers of oxidative stress.
We expect to demonstrate that dietary potassium protects the endothelium from the deleterious effects of high
sodium by reducing oxidative stress and endothelial cell stiffness and preserving NO. These studies are novel
in that they will be the first to comprehensively evaluate the role of dietary potassium on vascular function
independent of BP.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
The proposed research is relevant to public health because sodium intake continues to remain high and has
been shown to have deleterious effects on the vasculature independent of blood pressure. In contrast, dietary
potassium is known for its blood pressure lowering effects yet its role on the vasculature remains understudied.
Upon conclusion of this study, we will likely demonstrate that potassium blunts the deleterious effects of high
sodium on the vasculature, independent of blood pressure.",

Osteoporosis is the most common bone disease; 53.6 million Americans have a reduced bone mass, which
increases their risk of fragility fractures. In addition to the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, recent
studies show that approximately 60% of older men and 40% of older women have inadequate vitamin K
intakes. Growing evidence indicates that there are important interrelationships between vitamin D and vitamin
K on bone. Vitamin D increases intestinal calcium absorption and stimulates production of two proteins,
osteocalcin and matrix Gla protein. Vitamin K plays an essential role in activating these proteins so that
osteocalcin incorporates calcium in bone and matrix Gla protein inhibits calcification in soft tissues, including
the kidney. Both vitamins D and K are important for optimal function of these proteins. Although vitamin D
supplements are widely used to improve bone health, trials of supplemental vitamin D alone in reducing
fractures showed inconsistent results. Emerging evidence indicates that supplemental D in the context of low
vitamin K status is less effective on bone health measures. Therefore, low vitamin K status may account for
some of the inconsistencies of trials testing vitamin D and bone health and may contribute to toxicities
attributed to high-dose vitamin D such as kidney stones. No previous randomized controlled trials have been
adequately powered to test effects of vitamin K status on fracture risk or the interaction of vitamin K status with
high-dose, supplemental vitamin D on bone. To fill knowledge gaps, we propose an innovative, ancillary study
to the large, NIH-sponsored, VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL). VITAL is testing effects of supplemental
vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol, 2000 IU/d), and/or omega-3 fatty acids (fish oil, 1 g/d) in the primary prevention of
cancer and cardiovascular disease in 25,871 U.S. men (aged ≥50) and women (aged ≥55), including 5,106
African Americans. In this competitive renewal application of “VITAL: Effects on Bone Structure and
Architecture,” we will determine whether low vitamin K status, assessed by 3 sensitive biomarkers, modifies
effects of supplemental vitamin D on fractures, bone mineral density (BMD) and structure, and secondarily on
increases in urine calcium excretion, a risk factor for low BMD and kidney stones. During the first cycle of this
grant, we surpassed recruitment goals and collected baseline and 2-yr post-randomization imaging studies for
bone density, structure and architecture that will be used in the proposed studies (n=771). In addition, other
key VITAL resources will be leveraged including: 16,953 baseline and 6,000 follow-up blood samples;
measures of vitamin D, calcium, creatinine and parathyroid hormone; and adjudicated fractures and kidney
stones. This proposal provides a unique opportunity to clarify in the largest study of supplemental vitamin D,
the interdependencies of vitamins D and K and their roles on fractures, bone health measures, and urine
calcium excretion. Findings from the proposed ancillary study will be critical to the interpretation of on-going
vitamin D trials and provide new insights to advance clinical care and public health recommendations.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

This reaction is known to regulate the de novo purine biosynthesis and folate-dependent homocysteine re-methylation cycle. It could also play a key role in controlling the flux of one-carbon groups to anabolic pathways. In support of the role in the regulation of folate metabolism, we have recently shown that the loss of the ALDH1L1 gene in knockout mice causes functional folate deficiency, even when the mice had sufficient folate intake. Analysis of Aldh1l1 knockout mice also showed that the enzyme is the main regulator of glycine metabolism in the liver: KO mice have lower levels of glycine and glycine conjugates, indicating that the enzyme is involved in the folate-dependent synthesis of glycine from serine. We have further reported that human ALDH1L1 has six common non-synonymous exonic SNPs at the polymorphic loci rs3796191, rs2886059, rs9282691, rs2276724, rs1127717 and rs4646750 with the occurrence of haplotypes associated with these SNPs being remarkably different between ethnic populations. Our analysis of an established cohort of Hispanic children, Viva La Familia, has shown a significant reduction of serum glycine and increase in serine/glycine ratio in children with rs2276724 and rs3796191, indicating deregulation of serine to glycine conversion and re- capitulating our mouse findings. ALDH1L1 non-synonymous SNPs were also associated with markers of metabolic stress and adiposity in this cohort. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that non-synonymous ALDH1L1 SNPs produce enzyme variants with altered catalytic activity and/or stability that affects their ability to metabolize 10-formyl-THF and thus deregulates glycine metabolism. Accordingly, individuals with specific haplotypes have different ratios of THF/10-formyl-THF and serine/glycine, and altered levels of glycine and its conjugates, with perturbations in the metabotype representing a signature of metabolic health. This proposal will address the question of how haplotype-specific ALDH1L1 variants affect folate metabolism and the overall cellular metabotype, and how the haplotype-specific effect is modified by folate supplementation, by pursuing the following specific aims. Aim 1. Functionally characterize the ALDH1L1 enzyme variants from common human haplotypes. Aim 2. Determine the impact of major ALDH1L1 haplotypes on cellular metabolism and haplotype- specific responses to various folate supplementations. Aim 3. Link ALDH1L1 haplotypes to the folate-dependent regulation of glycine metabolism and health outcomes in humans. ALDH1L1 variants are very common in different populations but their role in folate homeostasis and in the etiology of metabolic disease is largely unexplored. It is expected that ALDH1L1 haplotypes differently mediate the metabolic response to dietary folate that might require adjustments of folate intake for individuals bearing certain ALDH1L1 SNPs. By filling this knowledge gap, the proposed research will provide mechanistic insight into the metabolic regulation by ALDH1L1 SNPs and will lay ground for the evaluation of population-specific ALDH1L1 haplotypes as a disease risk factor.","The ALDH1L1 gene in folate pathways has high frequency of non-synonymous polymorphisms with resulting haplotypes being different among human populations. The proposed research will functionally characterize haplotype-specific ALDH1L1 enzyme variants, determine how they differ in the regulation of folate and glycine metabolism, and define haplotype-specific metabotypes as a function of folate status and an indicator of metabolic health.",

Background. The risk of stillbirth, preterm delivery, low birthweight and other adverse pregnancy outcomes is
extremely high in Sub-Saharan African countries including Botswana, especially among HIV-positive women.
Daily iron and folic acid supplementation during pregnancy could reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes by
reducing maternal anemia. However, the effectiveness of supplementation in subgroups defined by HIV status,
anemia, gestational age, and other clinical, demographic and geographic factors remains unknown and
compliance with supplementation guidelines is variable (<50% in Botswana). Cost-effective interventions to
provide supplementation to pregnant women in Botswana and other resource-limited settings should be
designed to address key barriers to successful supplementation and to reach subgroups that would benefit
most from intervention. This K01 provides a unique opportunity to address this gap in the literature.
Candidate Overview. My long-term career objective is to become an independent investigator who specializes
in interventions to improve maternal and child health in resource-limited settings. My background is in
applications of epidemiologic methods to evaluate effects of HIV treatment strategies in adults and infants. A
K01 award will provide the necessary additional training and experience needed to become an expert in the
design, implementation, and evaluation of interventions to improve pregnancy outcomes in HIV-positive
women and underserved populations.
Career Development and Training Plan. My education program includes structured course work,
professional conferences, directed readings, and a research project with specific aims timed to coincide with
these activities. My mentorship team includes international experts who specialize in areas related to my
training goals: Dr. Scott Braithwaite (decision science), Dr. Roger Shapiro (HIV and maternal and child health
in Botswana), Dr. Donna Shelley (intervention development and implementation), and Dr. Carolyn Berry
(qualitative methods).
Environment. NYU School of Medicine provides an exceptional environment for me to conduct the proposed
study, obtain additional training and mentorship, and successfully transition to an independent investigator.
Research Strategy. Using the data and infrastructure from an ongoing birth outcomes surveillance study in
Botswana consisting of data from over 130,000 births, my study will: 1) estimate the effect of iron and folic acid
supplementation during pregnancy on adverse pregnancy outcomes by HIV status, anemia, gestational age,
and other key subgroups to identify populations that would benefit most from intervention; 2) assess barriers to
supplementation during and prior to pregnancy; 3) optimize a hypothetical intervention to provide
supplementation using computer simulation; and 4) develop and test the feasibility of an intervention to provide
supplementation to pregnant women in Botswana.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

The SWOG Statistical Center in Seattle, Washington, served as the coordinating center for two large prostate
cancer prevention trials: The Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) and the Prostate
Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT). SELECT was a Phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to
assess the effect of selenium and vitamin E, alone and in combination, primarily on prostate cancer incidence
and secondarily on other cancer incidence. SELECT randomized 35,533 men between 2001 and 2004. PCPT,
also a Phase III, double-blind trial, randomized 18,882 men to either finasteride or placebo between 1994 and
1997. Although schedules and requirements varied between the two studies, substantial serum, plasma, white
blood cells, and prostate tissue were collected on both, resulting in rich biorepositories.
Each had extensive prospective data collections which included diet and dietary supplements, quality of life,
physical activity, medications, other cancer diagnoses, cardiovascular endpoints, and treatment adverse events.
Although there have been significant scientific collaborations to date, there remain numerous opportunities to
further interrogate the clinical database and biobanks. Additionally, serum and plasma measures and extensive
genotyping data have already been obtained and are available for other investigators to use.
These cohorts are fully mature with 6,045 deaths and median follow-up of 18.4 years on PCPT and 3,762 deaths
and median follow-up of 10.1 years on SELECT. There have been 2,401 and 2,475 prostate cancers detected
during the trials plus an additional 890 and 338 prostate cancers identified via Medicare linkage in PCPT and
SELECT, respectively. Other primary cancers have also been documented either during the trials or through
data linkage. In addition to being able to extend the results of these well-conducted, randomized clinical trials
through linkages to Medicare, NDI and completed GWAS studies, these data can be used for epidemiologic
research as part of the ongoing consortium projects.
We request funds to continue to enrich the cohorts by collecting new data elements such as end point data from
Medicare and National Death Index linkages. We plan to update our linkages early in the upcoming grant period.
We also request support for the cohort team to develop detailed documentation and data sets to load into the
Cancer Epidemiology Data Repository, and we ask for continued support to provide a stable infrastructure for
the PCPT serum and PCPT and SELECT tissue repositories (all located at the University of Colorado). With
continued funding for the Statistical Center and some of our key scientific colleagues, we will be able to provide
administrative assistance and expertise to investigators who apply for additional funding to conduct studies using
our rich biologic repositories and clinical databases from PCPT and SELECT.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
By fully using the data and biologic samples from these two large cohorts with extensive follow-up, we will be
able to evaluate risk factors for prostate and other cancers, and subsequent prognosis. We will be able to
contribute clinical, demographic and biologic data, particularly genome wide measures, and we will provide
access to biologic specimens from men diagnosed with prostate and other cancers to researchers to better
understand the etiology of those cancers.",

Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem worldwide, and half of patients presenting with HF have
preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), rather than reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). However, HFpEF remains
a therapeutic challenge, given current limited understanding of causal and contributing factors. Functional iron
deficiency (FID, defined as a ferritin level < 100 ng/ml or transferrin saturation (Tsat) < 20% with ferritin < 300
ng/ml) is present in approximately half of all patients with either HFpEF or HFrEF. In patients with HFrEF, FID
is associated with reduced exercise capacity, poorer quality of life, and increased mortality regardless of
hemoglobin level. Correction of FID consistently and durably improves exercise capacity in HFrEF, however
less is known about the functional impact of FID in patients with HFpEF or in the general population. Beyond
its role in erythropoiesis, iron is an obligate component of myoglobin and enzymes involved in cellular
respiration, oxidative phosphorylation, vascular homeostasis, nitric oxide generation, and the citric acid cycle,
which all can be negatively impacted by iron deficiency. Hepcidin, a hormone synthesized by the liver, is
considered the master regulator of iron homeostasis. Hepcidin reduces iron bioavailability and levels are
regulated by inflammatory signaling pathways (eg, IL-6, IL-1β) and by the protein hemojuvelin which plays a
critical role in iron sensing. We have previously demonstrated that lower hepcidin levels are cardioprotective in
animal model studies and that elevated hepcidin levels in symptomatic HFrEF patients precluded normalization
of FID with oral iron supplementation in the NIH-sponsored multi-center IRONOUT-HF Trial. In our preliminary
studies of HFpEF patients undergoing comprehensive cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) FID with
reduced Tsat/hepcidin ratio was associated with exercise cardiac output, peripheral O2 extraction, pulmonary
vascular resistance and peak VO2, implicating FID as an important determinant of multiple aspects of exercise
capacity. We now propose to measure iron status, hepcidin and hemojuvelin levels in a large community-
based cohort (Framingham Heart Study Gen3/OMNI2, N=3,116) and in a referral cohort with suspected
HFpEF (MGH ExS, N=450) to understand the role of FID in relation to functional capacity, leveraging existing
CPET measures of low-level, intermediate and peak exercise O2 utilization in both cohorts. Our overarching
hypothesis is that FID arises in the setting of pro-inflammatory states that precede overt HFpEF, which is
characterized by impaired ability to augment O2 utilization, as reflected by reduced peak VO2. In Aim 1A, we
will determine the prevalence, risk factors, genetic determinants, and functional significance of functional iron
deficiency (FID) in the community. In Aim 1B, we will determine how FID relates to organ-specific dysfunction
indicative of HFpEF subphenotypes in the MGH Exercise Study. In Aim 2, we will prospectively investigate how
treatment of FID in a randomized trial of iron repletion in 66 HFpEF patients improves exercise capacity and
influences distinct mechanisms of exercise intolerance.","Project Narrative (Public Health Relevance)
Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a highly morbid condition in which exercise capacity is
significantly reduced. Our goal is to understand how functional iron deficiency relates to exercise capacity in
HFpEF and in middle-aged adults at risk for HFpEF. We will then perform a trial to investigate how iron repletion
influences mechanisms of exercise intolerance in patients with symptomatic HFpEF.",

ABSTRACT
In the past 5 years, the Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) has increased cumulative enrollment
to over 2000 adult and pediatric patients in the ongoing Prospective and Retrospective registry studies.
In addition, an “Acute” DILI protocol with collection of serial early biological samples for mechanistic
biomarker studies was developed and implemented. Other network aims included investigation of the
role of genetic polymorphisms in DILI susceptibility and outcome, development of improved causality
assessment methods, and expansion of the LiverTox website. The University of Michigan team led by
Dr. Fontana has played an important role in the design, implementation, and analysis of the primary and
ancillary DILIN studies since its inception in 2003. Michigan has not only been a leading enroller in all of
the ongoing Registry studies but also provided important leadership in multiple DILIN committees and
initiatives. The Michigan team now proposes a series of novel and feasible study aims for the DILIN
renewal. The PRIMARY AIM of this proposal is to continue to recruit and enroll high causality adult and
pediatric DILI cases into the registry studies for genetic, immunologic, biomarker and mechanistic
studies. The Michigan Hepatotoxicity Network has specific plans to increase the enrollment of ethnic
minorities via the engagement of hepatologists/ collaborators in southeastern Michigan and elsewhere
that care for a large number of African American, Hispanic, and Asian patients. In addition, further
development of natural language processing algorithms to search the EMR at the University of Michigan
are proposed to facilitate enrollment. Qualitative, quantitative and toxicological studies of the chemical
constituents in the herbal and dietary supplement (HDS) products implicated in a growing proportion of
DILI cases will be expanded via an ongoing collaboration with the National Center for National Products
Research. The SECOND AIM of this proposal is to conduct pilot/ feasibility clinical trials to improve the
outcomes of patients with severe acute DILI and those at risk for developing chronic DILI. Proposed
study designs include a 12 week course of a simple and safe, orally administered anti-inflammatory or
anti-oxidant agent (e.g. budesonide, SAMe, vitamin E) in selected patients with severe acute DILI at risk
for adverse outcomes. In addition, 12 to 24 week studies of a safe and effective orally administered anti-
cholestatic agent such as an ileal apical bile salt transport inhibitor that may reduce serum bile acids are
proposed for subjects at risk of chronic DILI. Lastly, prospective studies of magnetic resonance
elastography and MRCP imaging are proposed to improve our understanding of the severity and natural
history of DILI. The THIRD AIM of this proposal is to further expand the LiverTox website to include
additional chapters on HDS DILI, develop and implement a computerized causality assessment
instrument, and assemble working committees to insure that the website content remains up to date and
pertinent. Finally, additional collaborations between DILIN and the US FDA and other regulatory
agencies are proposed to enhance the pharmacovigilance capabilities of DILIN for new causes of DILI
and temporal changes over time.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
The University of Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network proposes to improve our understanding of
the etiologies, risk factors, and outcomes of DILI via the continued enrollment of adult and pediatric

differences in DILI susceptibility and outcomes via analysis of collected biological samples, DNA, liver
tissue, and clinical data. Pilot/ feasibility clinical trials of simple, safe and mechanistically based
treatments for patients with severe acute DILI and those at risk for developing chronic DILI are also
proposed. Finally, further development and enhancement of the LiverTox website is proposed to
include additional chapters on HDS DILI, development and implementation of a computerized diagnostic

 Arsenic (As) exposure afflicts >140 million people in 70+ countries worldwide, including the U.S., and
contributes to cancer and many other chronic diseases. Chronic exposure to manganese (Mn), a known
neurotoxin, through contaminated drinking water afflicts 50+ countries, including the U.S., and may interact
with As exposure for some outcomes. Furthermore, enforceable drinking water standards and biomarkers of
Mn exposure are lacking. Strategies to identify individuals at risk are urgently needed. Despite years of
research, the mechanisms by which As exposure leads to adverse health outcomes remains poorly
understood. Innovative approaches are needed to characterize metabolic effects of As and Mn exposures –
prior to disease onset – to begin to better understand the underlying mechanisms, ultimately to identify
individuals at risk. Once ingested, inorganic As undergoes methylation by S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to form
mono- (MMAs) and di-methyl (DMAs) arsenicals in a process that facilitates urinary As elimination. Methyl
groups from folate are required for SAM synthesis. In our recently completed randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled folic acid clinical trial (FACT) in Bangladesh, we demonstrated that FA supplementation
significantly increased As methylation to DMAs and thereby lowered blood As and blood MMAs, a toxic
intermediate. We propose to leverage data and biological samples from FACT to employ novel ultra high-
resolution metabolomics (HRM) analyses to identify metabolites and metabolic pathways associated with As
exposure, As exposure reduction, As methylation and the independent and joint effects of Mn exposure.
 The unique FACT study design includes provision of As-removal filters with/without FA supplementation (400
or 800 µg/d × 12 or 24 weeks). This design permits us to identify and validate novel metabolites and pathways
altered by As exposure and As methylation profiles (Aim 1a); Mn exposure (Aim 1b); and reduction in As
exposure (Aim 2a). Aims 2b-c allow us to identify persistence/reversibility by FA treatment, including effects of
dose-dependent increases in As methylation facilitated by FA supplementation; and the impact of co-exposure
to Mn (Aim 2d). In a new collaboration with Dr. Walker, Director of the Metabolomics Center at Mt. Sinai, we
will combine FACT’s rigorous RCT approach–the best possible design to determine causality in humans–with
our HRM platform that interrogates thousands of metabolites and most metabolic pathways. We will use dose-
and duration-dependent approaches to enhance the rigor of our findings. In Aim 3a, in a new collaboration with
Dr. Kioumourtzoglou at Columbia, we will use novel and robust pattern recognition approaches to identify
specific metabolic patterns that are impacted by As and Mn exposures. Aim 3b will use hierarchical modeling
to comprehensively quantify the As and Mn impacts on the pathways identified in Aims 1 and 2. The findings of
this study may inform policy decisions regarding FA fortification programs in As-endemic areas and may
identify biomarkers of As and Mn exposure that may inform decisions on drinking water standards.","Project Narrative
Arsenic (As) exposure afflicts >140 million people in 70+ countries worldwide, including the U.S., and

of As and Mn exposures to begin to better understand the underlying mechanisms, to identify individuals at

Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) comprise a range of effects resulting from prenatal alcohol
exposure (PAE) including neurological abnormalities, cognitive and behavioral impairments, growth
retardation, and craniofacial anomalies. Few treatments have been investigated despite FASD’s
tremendous public health burden. Cognitive deficits are a core feature of FASD, and cognition is a
natural target for intervention. One potential intervention for cognition in FASD is the essential
nutrient choline - known to have effects on brain development and cognition. In the hippocampus,
choline contributes to increased dendritic arborization, larger cells, and functional changes. Choline
affects the cholinergic system and alters brain structure and function in regions essential for memory
functioning, including methylation in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Only a handful of human
choline studies for FASD have been undertaken and our group has conducted most of them. Our
early double-blind, randomized, controlled trial established safety and tolerability. Our subsequent
trial revealed beneficial effects for sequential delayed memory in participants with FASD (greater in
younger [ages 2-3] rather than older [ages 3-5] children). Our third (ongoing) study included a long-
term follow-up that demonstrated long-term benefits for choline vs. placebo in non-verbal processing,
working memory, long-term verbal memory, and ADHD behavior. The proposed studies will include a
new clinical trial with a new cohort of 2-5 year old children with FASD. Rather than a placebo-
controlled trial, it will be a two-arm block-randomized study with cumulative choline exposure
durations of 3 or 6 months. Results will directly inform future clinical implementation of choline as a
neurodevelopmental intervention. The proposed studies will also capitalize on three existing cohorts
for additional longitudinal studies that will determine durability of effects from early treatment. A 4-
year and 8-year follow-up study will each examine cognitive effects as well as structural and
functional brain effects using advanced MRI methods. Cognitive measures will include the Stanford-
Binet Intelligence Scale, the Elicited Imitation memory test, the NIH Toolbox Flanker test and Picture
Sequence Memory Test, and the Minnesota Executive Function Scale. We will examine choline
effects on behavior using parent-report (CBCL) and a structured diagnostic interview (KSADS).
Select hippocampal sub-fields will be examined for volumetric improvements following choline or
placebo. Functional connectivity will be examined and is expected to reflect changes from early
choline supplementation. We will also use cortical myelin mapping to evaluate choline’s effect on
long-term myelin development. In addition, we will apply diffusion-weighted imaging to determine
choline’s effect on white matter microstructure – which is known to be disrupted in FASD.","NARRATIVE
We have completed several studies of choline supplementation in children with neurodevelopmental
abnormalities resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE): a feasibility study, a pilot efficacy study, and a
long-term follow-up study. The proposed study will continue that work, helping to determine whether choline
supplementation during a specific developmental window when the child’s brain remains plastic is able to
attenuate the deficits in thinking, memory, processing speed, and behavior that are common in children with
PAE and whether these changes are long-lasting. We will also use MRI to measure changes in the trajectory of
structures known to be involved in these cognitive functions as well as to examine the development of
connectivity in response to choline or placebo.",

 This proposal details a 5-year training plan to prepare the physician candidate, Thao (Tina) Ho, for a career as
an independent, translational investigator who will become a leader in the field of iron deficiency and anemia of
prematurity. The project will identify the effects of enteral iron supplementation, as prevention for anemia, on
intestinal health of preterm infants through complementary clinical and basic science studies.
 All preterm infants are at risk for iron deficiency. Enteral iron supplementation is recommended to all preterm
infants at 2-4 mg/kg/day; however, they are often given at higher doses, 6-10 mg/kg/day. Emerging evidence
suggest that enteral iron can exacerbate the overgrowth of enteric pathogens and suppress beneficial bacteria.
This imbalance, or intestinal dysbiosis, intestinal inflammation, and disrupted barrier are observed in necrotizing
enterocolitis, a devastating intestinal disease of prematurity. Preterm infants are colonized with higher
percentage of enteric pathogens at baseline compared to term infants. Dr. Ho’s preliminary data has led to the
hypothesis that high enteral iron supplementation exacerbates intestinal dysbiosis, mucosal
inflammation and permeability in preterm infants. Dr. Ho will test this hypothesis by conducting a randomized
study to compare the fecal bacterial composition, mucosal inflammation and barrier function between premature
infants given high vs. low iron regimens and investigating the cellular mechanisms with cytokine production and
gene expression using human 3D enteroid models. At the completion of this project, Dr. Ho will be experienced
in 1) designing and conducting clinical studies, 2) advanced biostatistical analyses and interpreting the results
of large clinical datasets, and 3) performing experiments on 3D cell models.

Despite prophylactic immune suppression, clinically significant (Grade II–IV) acute graft-versus-host disease
(aGvHD) afflicts up to 45% of pediatric patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation
(alloHCT). As aGvHD is responsible for nearly 20% of deaths following alloHCT, the need for better prevention
and therapy for aGvHD is readily apparent. Involvement of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract in the pathogenesis
of aGvHD has been substantiated by the translation of pre-clinical and clinical studies. Emerging evidence
suggests that perturbations in the microbiota diversity result in aberrant systemic immune response as well as
pathogen colonization and mucosal invasion, fostering the development of GvHD. Pre-clinical studies also
suggest that replenishing commensals like Lactobacillus prior to HCT substantially decrease GvHD severity
and intestinal insult. Our pilot data suggest that probiotics are safe to administer prior to and during children
and adolescents undergoing HCT (IND#108,977). This proposal is a double-blind, randomized, multi-center
intervention trial to evaluate the specific effect of probiotics in preventing GI aGvHD and more generally the
effects on overall GvHD severity. The proposal is an approved concept of Children’s Oncology Group’s (COG),
a NCI National Clinical Trial Network group. The study will be conducted through COG using its clinical
research infrastructure. Correlative laboratory studies (plasma and stool analysis) will be performed in order to
elucidate the mechanisms of action of probiotic therapy. The probiotic, Lactobacillus plantarum (LBP), or
placebo will be administered to 384 evaluable children and adolescents undergoing alloHCT for hematologic
malignancy beginning with the initiation of conditioning through Day 56. We hypothesize that maintaining
epithelial cell integrity through the administration of probiotic therapy will lead to restoring microbial diversity,
which will preserve immune tolerance and prevent aGvHD. The primary study aim is to determine efficacy of
orally-administered LBP in preventing the development of GI aGvHD in children and adolescents undergoing
alloHCT for the treatment of cancer. Secondary study aims are: (1) To determine whether orally-administered
LBP decreases the incidence of Grade II–IV aGvHD following alloHCT; (2) To determine whether LBP
administration maintains intestinal integrity as measured by mean plasma citrulline levels and reduction in
mucosal barrier injury (MBI) bacteremia; (3a) To measure the effects of LBP on the intestinal flora phylogenetic
composition during and after alloHCT using 16S rRNA gene deep sequencing; (3b) To measure effects of LBP
on intestinal flora function during and after alloHCT using metagenomic and metabolite profiling; and (4) To
measure proposed immunomodulatory effects of LBP in mean plasma levels of alloreactive-induced
inflammatory cytokines (IL-2, IL-6, IL-12p70, IFNγ, and TNFα) in patients receiving LBP compared to placebo.
The proposed study will be the first double-blind randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of
probiotics in preventing GI aGvHD in pediatric HCT. If a beneficial effect is observed, expansion of the
proposed intervention to other pediatric and adult malignant conditions requiring alloHCT may improve overall
quality of life and prevent transplant-related complications like aGvHD.","Project Narrative
The proposed study is a randomized, controlled intervention trial to determine the benefit of probiotic therapy in
preventing the development of gastrointestinal acute graft versus host disease in children undergoing
allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation for a hematologic malignancy. Importantly, correlative studies will

Public Health Issue: Low circulating levels of 25(OH) vitamin D (VD) have been correlated with many

Rationale: Glutathione (GSH) is a major physiological antioxidant. Recent studies report that low levels of
GSH are linked to 25(OH)VD deficiencies in both animal and human studies. Animal studies using ZDF rats
and a mouse model of 25(OH)VD deficiency have shown that, compared to supplementation with VD-alone,
co-supplementation with VD (cholecalciferol) + L-cysteine (LC, a GSH precursor) led to an improvement in
GSH status that resulted in significant increases in circulating levels of 25(OH)VD and reduced oxidative

GSH precursor) is more successful at optimizing the statuses of 25(OH)VD and GSH [biological signatures]
and simultaneously decreasing TNF-α and IR [functional or clinical outcomes], suggesting a better therapeutic
approach compared with supplementation with VD alone in AA subjects.
Impact on Public Health: The successful completion of this R33 clinical trial will have a significant impact on
the design of future efficacy clinical trials examining co-supplementation using a GSH precursor coupled with
lower VD doses to reduce 25(OH)VD deficiency/inadequacy, inflammation, and IR biomarkers. The
development of a safe, low-cost dietary supplement that can improve 25-hydroxy vitamin D status and reduce
insulin resistance and inflammation would provide significant benefits in the treatment of pre-diabetes and
health disparities, including chronic pain, in the African American population.
This application, which is highly responsive to PAR-18-828, will replicate previous human studies and examine
the outcome of biological signatures by combining the natural product L-cysteine with VD to optimize its
supplementation and efficacy.","NARRATIVE SUMMARY/RELEVANCE
 Two-thirds of our population is at risk for 25-hydroxy vitamin D deficiency and its associated health
hazards, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. This has led to widespread vitamin D
supplementation by the public. However, supraphysiological supplementation of vitamin D is needed to
achieve normal circulating 25-hydroxy VD levels, and some subjects respond poorly to supplementation or
experience side effects.
 The African-American (AA) population has been reported to have a higher incidence of 25-hydroxy VD
deficiency as well as clinical pain. This study will investigate whether the combined use of the nutrients VD
and L-cysteine exerts measurable and beneficial effects on 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels and insulin resistance
biomarkers. The translation and validation of our novel hypothesis could have a tremendous impact on medical
practice, leading to the novel recommendation that supplementation that combines the use of vitamin D and a
GSH precursor is superior to the current practice of supplementation with high-dose vitamin D alone.
 The long-term goal is to discover new approaches to ensure adequate 25(OH)VD status and to
prevent the adverse effects of vitamin D deficiency on health conditions in the African-American population.",

Asthma and allergic diseases continue to be major public health problems resulting in significant disability and resource
utilization globally. Most asthma is diagnosed before the age of six. Thus, prenatal and early life exposures play an
important role in the development of asthma and allergies. On the basis of finding an inverse association between family
size and atopy, it was postulated that reduced microbial exposure in early life explains the epidemic of allergic diseases
(the “hygiene hypothesis”). The original hygiene hypothesis has undergone changes and refinement, and is now taken to
mean not just simply a reduced microbial exposure, but perhaps changes in the breadth and types of microorganisms
coupled with changing environments. The gut flora is, quantitatively, the most important postnatal source of microbial
stimulation of the immune system. Significant differences between the gut flora of children in industrialized and
developing nations suggest that the high prevalence of asthma in affluent nations may be due to changes in the
intestinal flora of young infants. This concept of “dysbiotic drift,” whereby environmental forces related to Westernized
lifestyles leads to a shift of the developing microbiota away from the norm, may explain why many chronic inflammatory
conditions, such as asthma, are associated with Westernized lifestyles. Dysbiosis is a potential mechanism by which the
environment interacts with the early developing immune system to program risk for chronic disease.
While there are a growing number of studies that are investigating the role of the intestinal microbiome in asthma,
these have examined stool samples obtained at one point in time. Since the intestinal microbiome undergoes rapid
changes before it becomes established between the ages of 1 and 3 years of life, longitudinal studies are needed.
Additionally, no studies have accounted for the host genetic background, which may determine both the development
of dysbiosis and who develops asthma when faced with dysbiosis. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that
vitamin D deficiency in the pre-, peri-, and immediate post-natal periods, in addition to host genetic influences, lead
to intestinal dysbiosis in early life. Dysbiosis, in the proper host genetic context, then increases the risk for
development of asthma. While we have collected information on a host of other relevant exposures, this proposal will
focus on vitamin D as the primary exposure of interest. We have put together 2 vitamin D clinical trial populations –
Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART) and Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood
(COPSAC2010) – with prospective collection of exposures during pregnancy and early life, that we will leverage to test our
hypotheses. This proposal is in response to FOA RFA-OD-16-004, Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes
(ECHO) Pediatric Cohorts (UG3/UH3).
In these cohorts, we will first determine the patterns of change in the early intestinal microbiome (both composition and
metabolic function) up to age 6 years that are related with vitamin D deficiency in the prenatal and perinatal periods.
We will also investigate genetic markers of the host that affect these patterns in the intestinal microbiome. We will then
investigate the relationship of these patterns of change in the microbiome with the presence of asthma by age 6 years.
Findings from this project will point to potential mechanisms by which early environmental exposures interact with the
developing intestinal microbiome and the host to confer risk for asthma.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Asthma and allergies are the most common chronic disorders in children. There is a lack of understanding of
the risk factors and mechanisms that lead to asthma and allergies. We will investigate the role of two novel risk
factors – vitamin D and the intestinal microbiome – on the risk of asthma and allergies in the child, and
findings from this important and efficient study could form the basis for development of new and important
approaches to reduction of these conditions.",

Background. The risk of stillbirth, preterm delivery, low birthweight and other adverse pregnancy outcomes is
extremely high in Sub-Saharan African countries including Botswana, especially among HIV-positive women.
Daily iron and folic acid supplementation during pregnancy could reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes by
reducing maternal anemia. However, the effectiveness of supplementation in subgroups defined by HIV status,
anemia, gestational age, and other clinical, demographic and geographic factors remains unknown and
compliance with supplementation guidelines is variable (<50% in Botswana). Cost-effective interventions to
provide supplementation to pregnant women in Botswana and other resource-limited settings should be
designed to address key barriers to successful supplementation and to reach subgroups that would benefit
most from intervention. This K01 provides a unique opportunity to address this gap in the literature.
Candidate Overview. My long-term career objective is to become an independent investigator who specializes
in interventions to improve maternal and child health in resource-limited settings. My background is in
applications of epidemiologic methods to evaluate effects of HIV treatment strategies in adults and infants. A
K01 award will provide the necessary additional training and experience needed to become an expert in the
design, implementation, and evaluation of interventions to improve pregnancy outcomes in HIV-positive
women and underserved populations.
Career Development and Training Plan. My education program includes structured course work,
professional conferences, directed readings, and a research project with specific aims timed to coincide with
these activities. My mentorship team includes international experts who specialize in areas related to my
training goals: Dr. Scott Braithwaite (decision science), Dr. Roger Shapiro (HIV and maternal and child health
in Botswana), Dr. Donna Shelley (intervention development and implementation), and Dr. Carolyn Berry
(qualitative methods).
Environment. NYU School of Medicine provides an exceptional environment for me to conduct the proposed
study, obtain additional training and mentorship, and successfully transition to an independent investigator.
Research Strategy. Using the data and infrastructure from an ongoing birth outcomes surveillance study in
Botswana consisting of data from over 130,000 births, my study will: 1) estimate the effect of iron and folic acid
supplementation during pregnancy on adverse pregnancy outcomes by HIV status, anemia, gestational age,
and other key subgroups to identify populations that would benefit most from intervention; 2) assess barriers to
supplementation during and prior to pregnancy; 3) optimize a hypothetical intervention to provide
supplementation using computer simulation; and 4) develop and test the feasibility of an intervention to provide
supplementation to pregnant women in Botswana.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Iron and folic acid supplementation may reduce the high risk of stillbirth, preterm delivery, low birthweight and
other adverse pregnancy outcomes in resource-limited countries such as Botswana. The goal of the proposed
research is to identify and evaluate interventions to provide supplementation to pregnant women that address
key barriers to successful supplementation and reach populations that would benefit most from intervention.
The results of this work will inform supplementation strategies in Botswana and other resource-limited
countries and larger-scale intervention studies to provide supplementation to women in Botswana.",

Despite strong anti-smoking efforts, at least 12% of American women cannot quit smoking when
pregnant, resulting in more than 450,000 smoke-exposed infants born yearly. Maternal smoking during
pregnancy adversely affects lung development as seen by lifelong decreases in pulmonary function and
increased risk of asthma. In a randomized controlled trial (RCT), published in JAMA, we have provided
evidence that maternal vitamin C supplementation (500 mg daily during pregnancy) can decrease the effects of
maternal smoking during pregnancy on offspring lung function and the subsequent incidence of wheeze. The
purpose of this ECHO application is to combine the offspring from the prenatal cohorts of two RCTs studying
the effects of vitamin C supplementation to pregnant smokers on offspring respiratory outcomes and to
determine if the innovative therapy of maternal vitamin C supplementation during pregnancy leads to
prolonged improvements on offspring’s pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and respiratory health. To begin to
understand mechanisms by which prenatal vitamin C may be preventing changes in the health of offspring of
smokers, we examined gene specific DNA methylation from a subset of placentas, cord bloods and buccal
swabs (ages 2-5) collected from subjects who were the offspring of prospectively-followed pregnant placebo-
treated smokers, vitamin C-treated smokers, or non-smokers. In parallel with the effects of vitamin C on the
reduction of the effects of maternal smoking on offspring PFTs and wheeze, the supplementary vitamin C
prevented the majority of significant changes in DNA methylation induced by maternal smoking in both
placentas and cord blood. Strikingly, this prevention of alterations in DNA methylation was still evident 2-5
years later in offspring buccal swabs. This preliminary data suggests that the mechanism underlying vitamin
C’s prevention of some of the effects of maternal smoking on offspring pulmonary health involves the
prevention of epigenetic changes induced by maternal smoking. Thus this application has 4 specific aims: 1,
to create the combined cohort of offspring from the 2 RCTs of vitamin C supplementation to pregnant smokers;
2, to determine if the protective effects of maternal vitamin C supplementation to pregnant smokers on
offspring pulmonary health extend to early adolescence; 3, to begin to characterize the epigenetic mechanisms
that appear to underlie the effects of smoking during pregnancy on offspring lung health and on the protective
effects of vitamin C; and 4, to gather core data for and interact with the overall ECHO study. Respiratory
health will be assessed by longitudinal semi-annual, validated respiratory histories and yearly PFTs beginning
at 3 years of age. Buccal swabs will be collected yearly and blood at 6, 9 and 12 years to provide DNA for
genetic analysis. DNA methylation changes will be measured by methylation chips and bisulfite sequencing.
This study will address how smoking during pregnancy affects respiratory outcomes, provide mechanistic and
therapeutic insights, and provide subjects and data to ECHO to address other key outcomes.","Narrative
Maternal smoking during pregnancy is the largest preventable cause of childhood respiratory
illness, and children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy show lifetime decreases in
pulmonary function and increased respiratory illnesses and asthma. Sadly, more than 50% of
smokers who become pregnant continue to smoke and approximately 20% of expenditures for
childhood respiratory illness are caused by maternal smoking amounting to over $1 billion
annually in current health care dollars. The purpose of this ECHO application is to combine two
prenatal cohorts to study the effects of maternal smoking during pregnancy on respiratory
outcomes, determine if the innovative therapy of maternal vitamin C supplementation during
pregnancy leads to prolonged improvements on offspring’s pulmonary function tests and
respiratory health, and to interact with the greater ECHO cohort to promote childhood health
and well-being.",

Elevated circulating levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), increased serum phosphate, and anemia are
associated with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), cardiovascular disease (CVD), and chronic kidney disease
(CKD) progression in children. Current treatment strategies for CKD-mineral bone disorder and CKD-related
anemia include 1,25D, binders, iron, and erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESA). However, 1,25D therapy
further increases circulating and bone FGF23 levels, and iron deficiency and ESA treatment both also
stimulate FGF23 production. A novel paradigm in earlier CKD has been suggested with the use of phosphate
binders with or without an inhibitor of enteral phosphate absorption, when serum phosphate levels are
within the normal range, to lower FGF23 and to raise endogenous 1,25D levels. However, such approach led
to inconsistent results. Therapy with ferric citrate (FC), on the other hand, has been shown consistently to
lower FGF23 and phosphate levels while improving indices of iron metabolism in adults with CKD stages 3-4.
Furthermore, FC decreased serum phosphate levels, improved iron parameters and was well tolerated in
pediatric dialysis patients. Thus, FC may have added value especially for children with pre-dialysis CKD in
whom iron deficiency anemia and elevated FGF23 levels are highly prevalent. Moreover, iron deficiency is a
potent driver of FGF23 production. Therefore, we hypothesize that treatment with FC will lower intact FGF23
levels during a 12-month period in a randomized, double-blinded, two -arms parallel study in 160 pediatric
patients with CKD stages 3-4 and normal serum phosphate levels. The multi-site trial will pursue the following
specific aims: Specific Aim 1: To determine the efficacy of FC to lower serum intact FGF23 levels (primary
endpoint) in pediatric patients with CKD 3–4 over 12 months. Specific Aim 2: To determine the effects of the
interventions on anemia, kidney function, and indices of bone and mineral metabolism (secondary end-points).
Additionally, we will perform pre- and post-treatment bone biopsies to assess bone histomorphometry and
FGF23 expression in a sub-cohort of 24 UCLA patients. Specific Aim 3: To determine the safety and
tolerability of FC in pediatric CKD 3-4 patients. If our hypothesis is confirmed, then a new treatment paradigm
would emerge in which therapy with FC will be initiated early in CKD, when patients are normophosphatemic,
slowing progressive increases in FGF23 and blunting FGF23-associated adverse renal and CVD.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) levels are elevated in early stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in
children and they are associated with CKD progression and cardiovascular disease. Thus, strategies that lower
or limit the rise of FGF23 may lead to a new paradigm for the treatment of CKD-Mineral Bone Disorder. Thus,
early intervention that focuses on control of FGF23 may lead to correcting 1,25D deficiency with replacement
therapy that is associated with further rise in FGF23 levels.",

Our broad, long-term goal is to develop rational therapeutics for the orphan disease pantothenate kinase-
associated neurodegeneration (PKAN), an inborn error of vitamin B5 metabolism that is caused by defects in
the gene that encodes PANK2, the first regulatory step in the coenzyme A biosynthetic pathway, and to do so
as cost-effectively as possible. Children and adults affected by the disease develop a severe movement
disorder and a characteristic pattern of abnormal iron accumulation in the brain. PKAN causes profound
disability and suffering, especially in children, many of whom succumb to complications of the disease in the
first decade of life. No proven disease-modifying therapy is currently available.
In this project, we will build on recent work from the laboratory demonstrating a compelling, disease-relevant
molecular and functional signature in the PKAN mouse brain that is recapitulated in both fibroblast cell cultures
and in peripheral blood from human patients. This biological signature is ameliorated in vivo and in vitro by a
product of intermediary metabolism in a dose-dependent fashion.
In this application, we propose to extend this work to the clinic, evaluating the safety, tolerability and
pharmacodynamic profile of the product in a phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-
ranging, parallel-group study in children and adults with PKAN. A 6-month double-blind phase will be followed
by an 18-month open-label phase. We will also explore the feasibility of applying a latent growth curve
modeling approach to longitudinal natural history data to capture a disease modifying effect, with the goal of
informing future study design. We will employ a novel approach to study conduct that is designed to reduce the
barriers to study participation inherent in rare disease clinical research, minimize risks to subjects, and lessen
the burden on families.","Project Narrative

Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on
the host. One of the most common indications for probiotic treatment is the prevention of antibiotic-associated
diarrhea (AAD). Unfortunately, the efficacy of many probiotic products used for AAD is not supported by
rigorous independent research, and non-evidence-based clinical usage is common. Data from several studies
suggest antibiotic-induced disruption of commensal colonic bacteria results in a significant reduction in short
chain fatty acid (SCFA) production and a concomitant reduction in Na-dependent fluid absorption, ultimately
resulting in AAD. The probiotic strain Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 (BB-12) has been shown to
ameliorate a variety of gastrointestinal disease states and is known to produce acetate – the most abundant
primary colonic SCFA – at concentrations of up to 50 mM in vitro. Thus, we hypothesize that the concurrent
administration of BB-12 with antibiotics will protect against the development of AAD by the ability of BB-12 to
both generate acetate directly, and increase other SCFAs through cross-feeding of certain bacteria in the
Firmicutes phylum. For example, Clostridium, Eubacterium and Roseburia use acetate to produce butyrate,
another common SCFA. The primary aim of the R61 phase (N=60) is to determine if BB-12 can mitigate
antibiotic-induced reduction in SCFA concentration, as reflected in fecal acetate levels. We hypothesize that
antibiotics will decrease fecal SCFAs, but BB-12 supplementation will protect against antibiotic-induced SCFA
reduction, and/or be associated with quicker restoration to baseline SCFA levels as compared to control.
Antibiotic administration also lowers total microbial counts and diversity in the gut microbiota, disrupting the
homeostasis of the gut ecosystem and allowing colonization by pathogens. The secondary aim uses 16S rDNA
profiling to determine if BB-12 inhibits antibiotic-induced disruption of the gut microbiota. We hypothesize that
antibiotics will diminish the overall number and diversity of bacterial species present in the fecal microbiota,
and concurrent BB-12 supplementation will minimize antibiotic-induced shifts in the microbiota, and/or will be
associated with shorter recovery to baseline microbiota composition as compared to control. In the R33 phase
(N=108), to further delineate the effects of BB-12 administration on the antibiotic-depleted gut microbiota, we
will evaluate the timing of probiotic administration in four randomly assigned groups: 1) BB-12 yogurt
consumed at the same time as the antibiotic; 2) control yogurt consumed at the same time as the antibiotic; 3)
BB-12 yogurt consumed four hours after the antibiotic; and 4) control yogurt consumed four hours after the
antibiotic. Our long-term goal is to determine the impact of BB-12 on a variety of gastrointestinal disease states
and ages. Elucidation of the mechanism(s) of action will be integral in shaping the direction of future
translational research on probiotic effectiveness.","Project Narrative
Probiotics are commonly used to address gastrointestinal issues, such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea. While
some studies have shown that probiotics may help prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea, the mechanism of
action behind this effect is unclear. This study will generate valuable mechanistic data and help advance
probiotic research forward in a systematic, well-accepted manner.",

 The overarching goal of Research Component 2 (RC2) is to determine whether two non-invasive biological
interventions, transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation (tVNS) and a probiotic supplementation intervention (PBI), will
improve cognitive and brain functioning, systemic and neuroinflammation, and gut microbiome health in people living
with HIV (PWLH) who are high risk users of alcohol. The study will also delineate mechanisms of the gut-brain axis, which
is particularly relevant, given that the factors underlying adverse cognitive and brain effects of alcohol use among PLWH
remains unresolved. There is also considerable public health significance if beneficial effects of tVNS and/or PBI can be
demonstrated, as cognitive disturbances that adversely impact health outcomes, functional abilities and quality of life
are common (~ 50% prevalence), despite marked reductions in mortality in the era of antiretroviral therapies (ART).
Among PLWH with reconstituted immune function and undetectable viral loads, comorbid conditions remain common
and can have adverse functional consequences. High risk alcohol use, prevalent among PLWH, not only contributes to
cognitive and brain dysfunction, but also further exacerbates comorbidities (e.g. liver disease, hepatitis coinfection,
obesity, and cardiovascular and gastrointestinal dysfunction), and reduces treatment adherence while increasing the
propensity for high risk sexual behaviors, worse health outcomes, and transmission of the virus. The study’s clinical
significance is strong given the need for effective interventions to improve cognition and health outcomes in PLWH.
 To test these hypotheses, we will conduct a hybrid randomized clinical trial that will enroll 80 PLWH who are high
risk drinkers from our existing research infrastructure supported by the Southern HIV Alcohol Research Consortium
(SHARC). In a 2x2 factorial design, participants will be randomly assigned to one of 4 conditions (tVNS+placebo, sham-

Adequate diet quality has the potential to promote childhood cognitive health and have a lasting impact on
children’s ability for learning and achievement. My laboratory has identified that lutein, a plant pigment or
carotenoid found in rich quantities in dark green vegetables, is uniquely suitable for supporting childhood
cognition and achievement. Lutein is the predominant carotenoid in neural tissue, serving roles as an antioxidant
across neural membranes. Further, lutein, along with two other carotenoids (i.e., zeaxanthin and
mesozeaxanthin) accumulate in the macular as macular pigment, which is known to strongly correlate with brain
lutein. My work has linked macular pigment optical density (MPOD) – a noninvasive measure of retinal and brain
lutein – to greater childhood cognitive function. However, the cognitive implications of lutein and zeaxanthin
intake in children have not been directly investigated. This proposal aims to establish a causal relationship
between lutein intake, cognitive function, and academic performance. The central hypothesis is that lutein
consumption will benefit cognitive function and academic achievement in preadolescents. I also anticipate that
gains in cognitive outcomes will be mediated by the improvement in MPOD. These hypotheses will be tested by
conducting a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trial to examine the effects of 9-month carotenoid
supplementation on MPOD, cognition (attention and memory), and achievement among 8-10-year-old children

Abnormalities in cognition and mobility are common accompaniments of aging that often precede the
development of Alzheimer’s disease. Among their many etiologies, these abnormalities are associated with
alterations in the regulation of cerebral blood flow to frontal regions of the brain that subserve executive
functions and gait speed. We have previously shown that treatment with cocoa flavanols can improve blood
flow in response to a cognitive task (neurovascular coupling [NVC]), as well as executive function in older
people with impaired NVC. These compounds can also reduce the number of senescent cells and their toxic
secretory products (SASP) in a variety of tissues. In mice, “senolytic” compounds such as flavanols and
tyrosine kinase inhibitors, have been shown to reduce neurofibrillary tangle density, neuron loss, and
ventricular enlargement, and in humans with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, improve gait speed and other
functional abilities. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that the flavanol, Quercetin, and tyrosine kinase
inhibitor, Dasatinib, (Q+D) will improve NVC in response to an executive task, reduce circulating SASP
components, and in so doing, improve cognition and mobility in older adults who are at risk of Alzheimer’s
disease. Our specific aims are: 1) To conduct a 12-week single arm, open label, pre-post pilot study to
determine the feasibility and recruitment challenges of studying intermittent doses of Quercetin and Dasatinib
(Q+D) in 12 older adults aged 70 to 90 years with slow gait speed (<1.0 m/sec) and Mild Cognitive Impairment;
2) To obtain preliminary data on the effect of this Q+D regimen on: a) resting cerebral blood flow (CBF) and
neurovascular coupling (NVC) during an executive task, b) gait speed and executive function, and c) other
secondary measures of physical and cognitive performance; and 3) To develop preliminary evidence
concerning whether Q+D is associated with a) a reduction in biomarkers of senescence in serum and urine
and senescent cells in blood, and b) whether reductions in these biomarkers are associated with improvements
in NVC, gait speed, and executive function. This research will leverage the expertise and resources of the
Boston Pepper Center and Mayo Clinic-based Translational Geroscience Network. Its results may identify a
novel approach for improving cerebral blood flow regulation, mobility, and cognition in older adults, and
preventing their progression to Alzheimer’s disease. The study may also help establish proof-of-concept that
the cognitive and functional disabilities of older age may arise, in part, from the secretory products of
senescent cells and be alleviated by senolytic agents.","Narrative: The long-term goal of this study is to prevent common age-related impairments in cognition and

One in four people with HIV (PWH) report hazardous drinking [i.e., >7 (14) drinks per week or >3 (4) drinks per

all three- constituting an alcohol-associated syndemic (i.e., interaction of 2+ conditions to increase risk for poor
outcomes). This syndemic is associated with increased risk of incident cardiovascular disease (CVD). The
gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome is a strong candidate mechanistic pathway for the syndemic-related excess
CVD risk, through GI dysbiosis, microbial translocation (MT), and systemic inflammation. Dysbiosis is
characterized as a decrease in beneficial bacteria and increase in pro-inflammatory bacteria. GI dysbiosis
leads to MT, in which tight junctions of the GI lumen are compromised, driving systemic inflammation- a
leading cause of CVD. HIV, hazardous drinking, smoking and depression are independently associated with GI
dysbiosis, MT and inflammation. Beneficial butyrate producing bacteria, which downregulate pro-inflammatory
mediators, are depleted in hazardous drinking PWH. In humans with alcohol use disorder, probiotic use
attenuates MT and inflammation. Among PWH, probiotic (e.g., butyrate producing bacteria) with prebiotic use
(nutrients for bacterial growth), a combination known as “synbiotic”, favorably alters the GI microbiome within
4-16 weeks. We hypothesize that the alcohol-associated syndemic is associated with GI dysbiosis and
subsequent CVD related biomarkers and that targeted supplementation may restore GI microbiome
homeostasis and reduce inflammation. With a transdisciplinary mentoring panel at Vanderbilt University
Medical Center (VUMC), my career development plan will advance skills in clinical investigation of alcohol
syndemic phenotypes; microbiome structure, function, diversity and immunology; clinical & translational
research; and primary data collection, responsible conduct of research, and leadership. Aim 1 will identify
changes in the GI microbiome among PWH with the alcohol-associated syndemic over 12 months, Aim 2 will
determine changes in biomarker profiles related to GI permeability, MT, and inflammation among PWH with the
alcohol-associated syndemic over 12 months, and Aim 3 will evaluate the a) feasibility of administering a
butyrate supplement pill followed by a multi-strain synbiotic (prebiotic + probiotic) pill and b) treatment effects
on GI microbiome structures and CVD-related biomarkers among PWH with the alcohol-associated syndemic
(n=40). Aims 1 & 2 leverage secondary data from an NIAAA-funded microbiome study of 200 PWH with
existing GI microbiome data, sero-biomarker data, and validated self-reports of alcohol use, smoking, and
depressive symptoms. Aim 3 utilizes the infrastructure of the Tennessee Center for AIDS Research at VUMC,
which has a strong record of supporting Early Career Faculty. This award will facilitate my transition to an
independent investigator with expertise in alcohol/CVD epidemiology, microbiome structure and function, and
clinical trial development among PWH, and will also provide informative data for an R01 application.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
People with HIV-infection and concurrent hazardous drinking, smoking, and depressive symptoms (i.e.,
alcohol-associated syndemic) experience higher risk of cardiovascular disease compared to those without
these behavioral health conditions. The gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome is a strong candidate mechanistic
pathway for the syndemic-related excess CVD risk, through GI dysbiosis, microbial translocation (MT), and
systemic inflammation. This proposal aims to test the hypotheses that the alcohol-associated syndemic is
associated with GI dysbiosis and subsequent CVD risk and that targeted supplementation may restore GI
microbiome homeostasis and reduce inflammation; aligning with NIAAA’s objectives to prevent and treat HIV-
associated comorbidities and invest in HIV/alcohol translational research that addresses health and behavioral
issues clearly linked with HIV in the context of HIV, other substance use/addiction and mental health disorders.",

dementia, characterized by acquired and progressive cognitive decline, disability, and mortality. African
Americans (AA) have a two-fold higher risk of developing Alzheimer disease compared to non-Hispanic whites.
Alzheimer disease is a major public health concern with no effective treatment.
Rationale: Changes in the levels of plasma biomarkers (amyloid β, pTau, and amyloid precursor protein, APP),
have been used successfully to diagnose and monitor the onset and progression of the risk of Alzheimer disease.
My current NIH grant is for a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to test the hypothesis that
supplementation with vitamin D (VD) in combination with L-cysteine (LC, a GSH precursor) will optimize levels
of 25(OH)VD and GSH (biological signatures) and simultaneously decrease insulin resistance in AA. We will
have ongoing access to plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from the blood of AA enrolled
in this clinical trial that can be used to measure plasma biomarkers for the risk of Alzheimer disease.
Approach: AA have reduced levels of glutathione (GSH) as well as a high risk for developing Alzheimer disease.
Low levels of GSH, vitamin D deficiency, and elevated oxidative stress have been linked to a higher incidence
of cognitive decline in both animal and human studies. This administrative supplement presents an opportunity
to examine plasma biomarkers of the risk of Alzheimer disease and the genes that regulate APP metabolism
using blood collected from participants enrolled under the current NIH grant. There will be no change in the
design of the clinical trial. The administrative supplement will examine the hypothesis that blood biomarkers of
the risk of Alzheimer disease (functional or clinical outcomes) can be lowered beneficially by optimizing GSH
and reducing levels of oxidative stress in AA subjects.
Impact on Public Health: The successful completion of the additional investigations will have a significant
impact on the design of future full-scale efficacy trials to investigate the potential of co-supplementation with
VD+LC to reduce the inflammation/neuronal damage among AA. The development of a safe, low-cost dietary
supplement that improves GSH status, and reduces the progression of Aβ deposits, would significantly improve
treatment of Alzheimer disease and help to address other health disparities in the AA population.
This application, which is highly responsive to NOT-AG-21-018, will not change the protocol proposed in the
funded R33 application. However, it will allow analysis of additional biomarkers in the previously collected blood
to examine the outcome of biological signatures associated with the onset of dementia and Alzheimer disease.","NARRATIVE SUMMARY/RELEVANCE
 African Americans (AA) have a two-fold higher risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer disease (AD).
This study will investigate whether combined supplementation with the nutrients vitamin D (VD) and L-cysteine

developing dementia and Alzheimer disease in AA. The translation and validation of our novel hypothesis could
have a tremendous impact on medical practice, leading to the novel recommendation that supplementation
combining the use of vitamin D and a glutathione precursor has the potential to delay the onset and risks of
Alzheimer disease.
The long-term goal is to discover new approaches to reduce and prevent the high incidence of Alzheimer

Hypertension is the leading preventable risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality,
worldwide, and is a huge financial burden to society. Prevention and treatment of high blood pressure (BP),
including stage 1 hypertension, is crucial for reducing the global burden of CVD. Previous randomized
controlled trials have shown that potassium supplementation lowers BP. However, these trials only compared
the efficacy of a single dosage of potassium supplementation (mostly 60 mmol/day) compared with placebo on
BP. The lack of intake-response evidence between potassium supplementation and BP has resulted in an
inability to establish the optimal level of potassium intake for hypertension prevention and treatment. The
objective of this trial is to evaluate the intake-response relationship between potassium supplementation and
BP in adults with stage 1 hypertension. The primary outcome will be the difference in systolic BP from baseline
to 12-week follow-up among randomized groups. Secondary outcomes will include diastolic BP; 24-hour and
nighttime systolic and diastolic BP; and other CVD risk factors. The consistency of treatment effects by age,
sex, race, central adiposity, and baseline dietary sodium and potassium intake will be evaluated. This will be a
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, intake-response trial with a 4-arm, parallel design. Using a
stratified, blocked randomization scheme, eligible participants will be assigned to placebo or 1 of 3 potassium
supplementation arms in which 0, 30, 60, or 90 mmol/day (0, 1173, 2346, or 3519 mg/day) of additional
potassium will be administered orally for 12 weeks. The study participants, investigators, and clinical staff who
collect the study data will be blinded to intervention assignments. This trial has >90% statistical power to detect
an intake-response relationship between potassium supplementation and BP, assuming each additional 30
mmol/day (1173 mg/day) potassium decreases systolic BP by an additional 2 mm Hg over 12 weeks, beyond
placebo. We will recruit 208 study participants (n=52 in each group) with stage 1 hypertension (untreated
systolic BP 130-139 and diastolic BP <90 mm Hg) from the greater New Orleans metropolitan area. Eligible
participants will be randomized to treatment with placebo or 1 of 3 potassium supplementation interventions for
12 weeks. BP and other cardiometabolic risk factors will be measured at baseline, 6, and 12 weeks of follow-
up. Difference in baseline to 12-week systolic BP across the treatment arms will be compared per intention-to-
treat analysis. This study is novel because it is the first randomized controlled trial to test the intake-response
effects of potassium supplementation on BP in humans. The study has important clinical and public health
significance because it will identify the optimal level of potassium supplementation for BP lowering among
adults with stage 1 hypertension. This information can be used to develop dietary guidelines for the prevention
and treatment of hypertension. Additionally, it will allow the Research Project Leader to gain expertise in the
design and conduct of randomized controlled trials, and aid in his transition to research independence.","No data",

and omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA in 1:1 ratio, 1000 mg/d) – for the prevention of late-life depression (LLD)
and promotion of long-term healthier mood among older adults. VITAL-DEP, an ancillary of the VITAL trial of
cardiovascular disease and cancer prevention, enrolled over 18,000 men and women, aged 50+ years (mean
age=67 years) and at risk for depression, who were followed for a median of 5.3 years of randomized treatment.
Detailed phenotypic assessments were completed at baseline and follow-up in a subset of over 1,000
participants in the local Clinical and Translational Science Center for: psychiatric diagnostic interviews;
neuropsychological testing; self-reports on dimensional measures of depression, anxiety, daily functioning, and
social, health and behavioral risk factors. VITAL-DEP achieved substantial racial/ethnic diversity: 20% of
participants are Black/African American adults and 30% are racial/ethnic minorities. This competing renewal
leverages the rich resources of the assembled cohort and builds on the findings regarding randomized treatment
effects in the prior funding period. We observed: 1) evidence that vitamin D3 significantly reduces decline in
global cognition and executive function among Black adults; 2) modest differences in effects of omega-3 on LLD
risk and sex differences in effects. Inflammatory, structural and functional MRI, and plasma and PET tau markers
selected for this proposal show evidence in the literature and preliminary data for relevance to LLD and cognition.
Also, given evidence of higher burden of LLD and cognitive decline for women, Black adults, APOE4 carriers
and those with higher systemic inflammation, we will determine moderation in outcomes by these risk groups.
Specific Aims: 1) We will test causal effects of long-term vitamin D3 on serial measures of plasma tau (NT1),
which is associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms in preclinical dementia and has high long-term predictive
validity for cognitive decline, independent of other preclinical cognitive markers. 2) We will measure associations
of baseline plasma tau with long-term cognitive change, mood symptoms and differences in MRI and PET-tau
markers at follow-up. Secondarily, we will examine biological mechanisms for observed sex differences for
omega-3 and LLD risk and race differences for vitamin D3 and cognitive decline. In exploratory aims, we
hypothesize: study associations will be moderated by baseline inflammation, vascular risk, age, hormone status
(in women), and APOE4. Findings from prior funding periods already have implications for public health
regarding use of both supplements for prevention in late-life mental health. This renewal proposal will similarly
impact the field by clarifying mechanisms for treatment effects on LLD and cognition in key clinical groups and
the direct effects of the agents on the brain and preclinical risk markers.","PROJECT NARRATIVE

Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of lower-extremity disability in adults. There is no known cure, so
the identification of effective strategies to reduce the consequences of knee OA is important to delay disability
and reduce associated cost burden. Multiple lines of biologic, genetic, and epidemiologic evidence support a
critical role for vitamin K and vitamin K-dependent proteins (VKDPs) in maintenance of joint health. Vitamin K
is an established shortfall nutrient. Preclinical models indicate that vitamin K insufficiency adversely affects
articular cartilage. In observational knee OA studies, older adults with low circulating concentrations of vitamin
K have poorer lower-extremity function. Vitamin K is required to produce functional VKDPs found in the joint
and there is emerging evidence that it regulates transcription of genes in articular cartilage through the nuclear
receptor SXR/PXR. Therefore, there are strong physiological underpinnings to support a protective role for
vitamin K in knee OA. However, no clinical trials have yet been conducted. To address critical parameters
required to design a larger clinical trial, we propose a randomized controlled pilot study in adults with mild to
moderate knee OA and low baseline vitamin K status to: (1) Pilot study procedures and assess the feasibility of
implementing a larger scale definitive clinical trial of vitamin K supplementation in adults with mild to moderate
knee OA and low baseline vitamin K status at two clinical sites; and (2) Determine the responsiveness of
performance-based tests of physical function in adults with low vitamin K status and mild to moderate knee
osteoarthritis. This randomized pilot study will generate critical data to guide the design of a larger clinical trial
to evaluate vitamin K as a potential therapy to mitigate the decline in lower-extremity function among adults
with symptomatic knee OA and low vitamin K status. Identifying a single well-tolerated intervention that
favorably reduces knee OA progression would represent an important therapeutic breakthrough.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the role of vitamin K in
osteoarthritis offers a potentially important, novel, and low-cost intervention for populations at higher risk for
lower extremity disability. In addition, the proposed research supports NIAMS’ mission to research the cause
and prevention of osteoarthritis, and aligns with the NIH Nutrition Strategic plan, Strategic Goal 4, Reduce the
Burden of Disease in Clinical Settings.",

Abundant preclinical and epidemiologic data suggest that vitamin D possesses anti-neoplastic activity, and that
individuals with higher plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels have lower risk of colorectal cancer (CRC)
and improved survival from CRC. Despite compelling evidence implicating vitamin D in CRC, critical questions
remain about whether these findings reflect a true causal relationship, and what the biological mechanisms of
vitamin D activity are. Our central hypothesis is that vitamin D supplementation to achieve sufficient levels of
25(OH)D leads to improved survival in CRC patients, possibly through activation of anti-tumor immunity. We will
test this hypothesis within two novel randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of vitamin D supplementation: a) SOLARIS,
the first phase III RCT of high- vs. low-dose vitamin D3 in combination with chemotherapy in patients with met-
astatic CRC (mCRC) that was borne directly out of the SUNSHINE phase II RCT that we completed during the
current funding period; and b) RCT of preoperative high-dose vitamin D3 vs. placebo in patients with resectable
liver metastases for examination of vitamin D biology in these tumors, which harbor a particularly immunosup-
pressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and account for a significant proportion of deaths from CRC. We will
also conduct a preclinical trial of vitamin D +/- immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in a novel mouse model of
CRC liver metastasis to explore whether vitamin D can overcome resistance to immunotherapy. In Aim 1, we
will investigate the impact of supplemental vitamin D on plasma 25(OH)D levels and progression-free survival
(PFS) among mCRC patients enrolled in the SOLARIS phase III RCT, and explore predictive biomarkers of
clinical efficacy. In Aim 2, we will investigate the impact of supplemental vitamin D on the TME of primary colon
tumors and liver metastases in patients enrolled on the preoperative vitamin D RCT using spatial transcriptional
profiling and multiplex immunofluorescence. In Aim 3, we will investigate the impact of supplemental vitamin D
+/- ICIs on tumor response and anti-tumor immunity in mouse models of microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC with
and without liver metastases using multiparameter flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing. In summary,
this translational proposal leverages unprecedented RCTs of vitamin D, cutting-edge technologies, and multidis-
ciplinary collaborations to extend our previous work and take the next critical steps in understanding vitamin D
in CRC. Our findings will lead to incorporation of vitamin D into standard of care and inform new combination
strategies with immunotherapy, which has thus far been ineffective in MSS CRC. Importantly, the global impact
of an inexpensive and safe therapy such as vitamin D cannot be underestimated for improving the prognosis of
this lethal disease.","PROJECT NARRATIVE
The proposed research is relevant to public health because colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of
cancer death in the U.S., and new treatment strategies are urgently needed. Abundant preclinical and epidemi-
ologic data link lower levels of circulating vitamin D to increased risk of and mortality from colorectal cancer, but
causal evidence from randomized clinical trials is needed before vitamin D supplementation can be incorporated
into standard of care treatment. This proposal will provide causal evidence in support of the clinical efficacy of
vitamin D supplementation in patients with colorectal cancer, as well as elucidate underlying mechanisms of
action on the immune tumor microenvironment that may lead to novel combination treatment strategies with
immunotherapy agents.",

 An estimated 250 million children in low- and middle-income countries are at risk of not fulfilling their
developmental potential, partly due to undernutrition. The long-term goal of this proposal is to inform evidence-
based programs and policies to support children in Ghana and other low- and middle-income countries to grow
and develop to their full potential. This proposal is to conduct a follow-up study of children at age 8-12 years
whose mothers participated in a randomized control trial providing lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNS) to
pregnant women from ≤ 20 weeks of gestation through 6 months postpartum and to their children from age 6 to
18 months (n = 440), comparing outcomes to control groups who received maternal micronutrient capsules
during pregnancy and postpartum (n = 880). The objective is to examine the long-term effect of early nutrition
on brain and nervous system development, while strengthening the research environment and capacity at the
University of Ghana to conduct neurobehavioral and neuroimaging research. The specific aims are 1) To
investigate the effect of LNS on social-emotional development at school age and in the context of children's
home environments and 2) to investigate the potential neural mechanisms through which LNS buffers the
effects of a disadvantaged environment on children's development of social-emotional difficulties. The
hypotheses are that 1) children in the LNS group will have fewer social-emotional and behavioral problems,
compared to children who did not receive LNS, 2) greater effects of LNS will be found in children from more
disadvantaged home environments, and 3) intervention group differences in autonomic nervous system
regulation and white matter integrity measured by diffusion tensor imaging will mediate group differences in
social-emotional development. The rationale is based on the previous finding that children in the LNS group
had fewer social-emotional difficulties at age 4-6 years, with greater effects of LNS in children from
disadvantaged home environments, suggesting that early supplementation buffered the effect of a
disadvantaged environment on the development of social-emotional difficulties in this sample, in which a high
percentage of children had a social-emotional difficulties score in the abnormally high range. Nutrients
contained in LNS, such as iron and essential fatty acids, are necessary for myelination of brain areas involved
in social-emotional regulation and processing, which occurs rapidly during pregnancy and the first two years
after birth. This study will be the first long-term follow-up study in Africa of a randomized trial of both pre-natal
and post-natal nutritional supplementation covering most of the first 1000 days from conception to age two
years, adding to evidence from only two other such studies, both conducted in Latin America (Guatemala and
Colombia) in the 1970s. This study represents an unprecedented opportunity to examine the long-term effects
of supplementation with both macro- and micro-nutrients during most of the first 1000 days using a randomized
controlled design, and the underlying neural mechanisms of the effects of early nutrition on later behavior.","Project Narrative
The proposed study will add to the evidence base for the effectiveness of nutritional interventions during early
life, and the long-term return on investment of maternal and child nutrition programs, to inform evidence-based
health policy in Ghana and other low- and middle-income countries. Evidence from this study could support
investment in maternal and child nutrition as an effective prevention strategy to reduce the burden on the
health care system to provide mental health services to adolescents and adults. This is in accordance with the
World Health Organization's Mental Health Action Plan 2013-2020 which highlights the importance of

At present the treatment options for COPD are limited and new therapies are needed to treat/prevent progression of COPD. Environmental factors and host response leading to imbalance in the ratio of oxidants to antioxidants, and proteases to antiproteases leading to chronic inflammation and tissue destruction is thought to play crucial role in development and progression of COPD.
Quercetin is a plant flavonoid and has potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Quercetin supplementation decreased markers of oxidative stress and inflammation in the plasma of patients with another chronic lung disease, pulmonary sarcoidosis. Quercetin also decreased both oxidative stress and lung inflammation in a preclinical model of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However the impact of quercetin in altering biological signatures in COPD subjects is yet to be determined.
The proposed study is conducted in two phases, R61/R33 to define and confirm the biological effects of quercetin in COPD, bioavailability, safety, identification of the appropriate biological signatures which reflect clinical outcomes in COPD. This study will also define the optimal dose of quercetin required for altering biological signatures favorably. This information is necessary to conduct the future clinical trials with quercetin in COPD patients.
In R61 Phase, there will be 15 study participants with moderate COPD with FEV1 ranging between 45 and 70 % of predicted and they will be randomized to receive either placebo or quercetin 2000 mg/day for 6 months. In R33 phase there will be 35 COPD subjects, who will be randomized to receive placebo, or one of the 3 quercetin doses, 500, 1000 or 2000 mg/day.
Outcome of R61 phase will determine the feasibility of R33 Phase.  In both R61 and R33 phases, all subjects will be characterized using a validated symptom questionnaire, medication and smoking histories, analysis of co-morbidities, and physical examination. All subjects will be asked to go on a low quercetin diet 7 days prior to start of quercetin or placebo supplementation to until the end of trial. Blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) will be collected after 7 days washout period (run-in) and after study drug treatment. Blood will also be collected at 3 months of study drug treatment. Plasma and BAL quercetin levels, markers of inflammation and oxidative stress in blood and BAL will be measured. Pulmonary function, and blood profiles (CBC and CMP) will be performed at run-in and at 3 and 6 months of study drug treatment to assess the safety.

Public Health Issue: Low circulating levels of 25(OH) vitamin D (VD) have been correlated with many
adverse health conditions and health disparities in African Americans (AA). Supraphysiological high-dose VD
supplementation is required to eliminate the differences observed in the levels of circulating 25(OH)VD in AA
and white subjects. However, recent studies have questioned the therapeutic effects of high-dose VD
supplementation.
Rationale: Glutathione (GSH) is a major physiological antioxidant. Recent studies report that low levels of
GSH are linked to 25(OH)VD deficiencies in both animal and human studies. Animal studies using ZDF rats
and a mouse model of 25(OH)VD deficiency have shown that, compared to supplementation with VD-alone,
co-supplementation with VD (cholecalciferol) + L-cysteine (LC, a GSH precursor) led to an improvement in
GSH status that resulted in significant increases in circulating levels of 25(OH)VD and reduced oxidative
stress, TNF-α, and insulin resistance (IR).
Approach: AA have reduced levels of glutathione (GSH), as well as a high incidence of insulin resistance (IR)
and inflammatory disorders. This R33 application presents our design for a randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled clinical trial to test the hypothesis that supplementation with VD in combination with L-cysteine (a
GSH precursor) is more successful at optimizing the statuses of 25(OH)VD and GSH [biological signatures]

approach compared with supplementation with VD alone in AA subjects.
Impact on Public Health: The successful completion of this R33 clinical trial will have a significant impact on
the design of future efficacy clinical trials examining co-supplementation using a GSH precursor coupled with
lower VD doses to reduce 25(OH)VD deficiency/inadequacy, inflammation, and IR biomarkers. The
development of a safe, low-cost dietary supplement that can improve 25-hydroxy vitamin D status and reduce
insulin resistance and inflammation would provide significant benefits in the treatment of pre-diabetes and
health disparities, including chronic pain, in the African American population.
This application, which is highly responsive to PAR-18-828, will replicate previous human studies and examine
the outcome of biological signatures by combining the natural product L-cysteine with VD to optimize its
supplementation and efficacy.","NARRATIVE SUMMARY/RELEVANCE
 Two-thirds of our population is at risk for 25-hydroxy vitamin D deficiency and its associated health
hazards, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. This has led to widespread vitamin D
supplementation by the public. However, supraphysiological supplementation of vitamin D is needed to
achieve normal circulating 25-hydroxy VD levels, and some subjects respond poorly to supplementation or
experience side effects.
 The African-American (AA) population has been reported to have a higher incidence of 25-hydroxy VD
deficiency as well as clinical pain. This study will investigate whether the combined use of the nutrients VD
and L-cysteine exerts measurable and beneficial effects on 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels and insulin resistance
biomarkers. The translation and validation of our novel hypothesis could have a tremendous impact on medical
practice, leading to the novel recommendation that supplementation that combines the use of vitamin D and a

 The long-term goal is to discover new approaches to ensure adequate 25(OH)VD status and to
prevent the adverse effects of vitamin D deficiency on health conditions in the African-American population.",

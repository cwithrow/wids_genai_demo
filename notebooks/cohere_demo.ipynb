       " 'Project Abstract': ' ABSTRACT Disparities in prostate cancer (Pca) are caused by complex interactions of genetic susceptibility, individual risk factors, and environmental factors. Pca is the second leading cause of death among all men; however African American (AA) men have the highest mortality rate of Pca of any racial/ethnic group in the U.S. This difference in mortality accounts for 44% of the overall cancer mortality disparity between AA and European-American (EA) men. Thus, there is a critical need to explore the etiologic pathways that contribute to this disparity. Unfortunately, the only well-established risk factors (age, race and family history) for Pca are non-modifiable. However recent studies have found low levels of vitamin D have been associated with increased Pca risk, and treatment with vitamin D has reduced Pca disease progression in multiple studies. These studies support the hypothesis that vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of Pca and that vitamin D is a potential chemopreventive and therapeutic agent. Although genetic and environmental factors including common low penetrant alleles, diet, body mass index (BMI), and vitamin D levels may affect risk, their significance and multiple joint effects are unclear. Extensive data exists in support of a critical role for Vitamin D3 [25(OH) vitamin D] on Pca risk. However, it is difficult to determine its importance mainly because Vitamin D is synthesized in the skin, and serum levels are strongly influenced by skin color, genetic ancestry, age, BMI, and environmental factors such as sunlight exposure and diet. The goal of this project is to explore the effects of serum Vitamin D, UVR exposure, skin color, age, BMI, and genes involved in Vitamin D synthesis, metabolism and signaling on Pca and aggressive Pca risk in a study of 2,000 AA and 2,000 EA men. Men aged 40-79 will be recruited from a consortium of Chicago hospitals including, the University Illinois at Chicago Hospital System, University of Chicago Medical Center, Northwestern Memorial Hospital, John H. Stroger Cook County Hospital, and the Jesse Brown Veteran Affairs Medical Center. This project will improve our understanding of the role Vitamin D plays on prostate cancer susceptibility, specifically among African Americans, and if lower vitamin D levels in AAs account for a portion of the disparity in Pca incidence and mortality between AAs and EAs. More importantly, given that UVR and diet are general environmental exposures that can be easily modified, understanding their impact may have broad health implications.'}"

      "**1. Vitamin D and Cancer Prevention:**\n",
      "\n",
      "   - Some observational studies have suggested an association between low levels of vitamin D and an increased risk of certain types of cancer, including colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer. However, it is important to note that these studies do not prove causation.\n",
      "   - A 2019 review of randomized controlled trials found that vitamin D supplementation did not significantly reduce the risk of developing cancer, except for a possible small reduction in the risk of lung cancer.\n",
      "   - More research is needed to understand the potential role of vitamin D in cancer prevention, including the optimal dose and the potential benefits for specific populations.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Vitamin D and Cancer Treatment:**\n",
      "\n",
      "   - In vitro and animal studies have suggested that vitamin D may have anti-cancer properties, including the ability to inhibit cancer cell growth and promote cancer cell death.\n",
      "   - However, the evidence from human studies is limited and inconsistent. Some small studies have suggested that vitamin D supplementation may improve survival rates in certain types of cancer, while others have found no significant benefit.\n",
      "   - More large, well-designed clinical trials are needed to determine the effectiveness of vitamin D as a complementary therapy for cancer treatment.\n",

Experimental studies suggest that inadequate vitamin D and I-3 fatty acid (FA) levels may be involved in the pathogenesis of HTN through multiple biological mechanisms. Observational studies have shown inverse associations of plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels and dietary I-3 FA intake with blood pressure (BP) and HTN. Small intervention trials of vitamin D and fish oil rich in I-3 FA suggest possible BP-lowering effects; however, larger trials using adequately high doses of vitamin D and I-3 FA for the primary prevention of HTN are lacking. The VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL), an NIH-supported, large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2x2 factorial trial, will test 2000 IU/day of vitamin D (as vitamin D3 [cholecalciferol]) and 1 g/day of marine I-3 FA (eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] + docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) supplements on incident cardiovascular disease and cancer in 20,000 multiethnic men and women with 5 years of treatment and follow-up. VITAL provides an optimal cost-effective setting to examine the effects of both interventions on changes in BP and incident HTN. Further, as this project would begin in parallel with enrollment into the parent VITAL trial, pre-randomization assessments of BP and biomarkers will be possible. In this proposed ancillary study, we will recruit a representative subcohort of 1,000 VITAL participants without baseline HTN from 5 major US metropolitan areas to conduct home-based examinations at baseline and 2 years follow-up through Examination Management Services, Inc (EMSI). We will obtain 24-hour ambulatory BP (ABP), fasting bloods, 24-hour urines, and other clinical assessments in this EMSI subcohort. We will also ascertain incident HTN cases in the overall VITAL trial. We will test the following hypotheses: (1) whether vitamin D and fish oil supplementation lowers 24-hour ABP compared to placebo in the EMSI subcohort of 1,000 participants; (2) whether vitamin D and fish oil supplementation reduces the risk of incident HTN compared to placebo among all randomized VITAL participants without baseline HTN; and (3) whether vitamin D and fish oil supplementation favorably changes HTN-related biomarkers that are putative mechanistic mediators linking vitamin D and I-3 FAs with HTN compared to placebo. This proposed study will provide definitive evidence to support or refute the potential preventive roles of vitamin D and I-3 FA on BP and the development of HTN.

Vitamin D deficiency is more common among African American (AA) individuals, especially those from urban environments or with obesity. We and others have contributed to increasing evidence that vitamin D insufficiency may contribute to more severe asthma through increased risk of respiratory infection and decreased glucocorticoid sensitivity. Indeed, low vitamin D levels were recently linked with the need for exogenous glucocorticoids and increased asthma severity. Particularly relevant to health disparities, we showed a strong association between vitamin D insufficiency and asthma in urban African American (AA) youth. Because AA youth residing in urban Washington, DC have markedly worse asthma than other racial/ethnic groups (e.g. prevalence rate 20% higher than the national rate 15 and emergency department utilization rates up to 5 times the national rates and nearly 10 times the Healthy People 2010 target rate), we will utilize our access to this population at the extreme of asthma disparities to examine the contribution of vitamin D to disparities in the chronic control and acute severity of asthma. The overall goal of this application is to provide critical epidemiological/molecular information that will inform the interpretation of ongoing and impending randomized clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation in asthma, especially with regard to urban AA youth with asthma. The knowledge generated by the experiments in this application will be crucial to translation of this inexpensive, easily-accessible potential therapy for asthma. We hypothesize that low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels are associated with poor chronic asthma control, worse acute asthma severity, and glucocorticoid insensitivity. AIM 1. Define asthma phenotypic clusters and determine cross- sectional inter- and intra-cluster associations with serum 25(OH)D levels within and between AA and non-AA youth. AIM 2. Determine prospective associations among serum 25(OH)D levels and: (a) chronic asthma control and (b) acute asthma severity within and between AA and non-AA youth. AIM 3.

      "{'Investigator Names': 'KITTLES, RICK Antonius', 'Project Abstract': ' ABSTRACT Disparities in prostate cancer (Pca) are caused by complex interactions of genetic susceptibility, individual risk factors, and environmental factors. Pca is the second leading cause of death among all men; however African American (AA) men have the highest mortality rate of Pca of any racial/ethnic group in the U.S. This difference in mortality accounts for 44% of the overall cancer mortality disparity between AA and European-American (EA) men. Thus, there is a critical need to explore the etiologic pathways that contribute to this disparity. Unfortunately, the only well-established risk factors (age, race and family history) for Pca are non-modifiable. However recent studies have found low levels of vitamin D have been associated with increased Pca risk, and treatment with vitamin D has reduced Pca disease progression in multiple studies. These studies support the hypothesis that vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of Pca and that vitamin D is a potential chemopreventive and therapeutic agent. Although genetic and environmental factors including common low penetrant alleles, diet, body mass index (BMI), and vitamin D levels may affect risk, their significance and multiple joint effects are unclear. Extensive data exists in support of a critical role for Vitamin D3 [25(OH) vitamin D] on Pca risk. However, it is difficult to determine its importance mainly because Vitamin D is synthesized in the skin, and serum levels are strongly influenced by skin color, genetic ancestry, age, BMI, and environmental factors such as sunlight exposure and diet. The goal of this project is to explore the effects of serum Vitamin D, UVR exposure, skin color, age, BMI, and genes involved in Vitamin D synthesis, metabolism and signaling on Pca and aggressive Pca risk in a study of 2,000 AA and 2,000 EA men. Men aged 40-79 will be recruited from a consortium of Chicago hospitals including, the University Illinois at Chicago Hospital System, University of Chicago Medical Center, Northwestern Memorial Hospital, John H. Stroger Cook County Hospital, and the Jesse Brown Veteran Affairs Medical Center. This project will improve our understanding of the role Vitamin D plays on prostate cancer susceptibility, specifically among African Americans, and if lower vitamin D levels in AAs account for a portion of the disparity in Pca incidence and mortality between AAs and EAs. More importantly, given that UVR and diet are general environmental exposures that can be easily modified, understanding their impact may have broad health implications.', 'Project ID': 'MD007105', 'Project Title': 'Biological and Environmental modifiers of Vitamin D3 and Prostate Cancer Risk', 'id': 'doc_15'}\n",
      "{'Investigator Names': 'Eckard, Allison ', 'Project Abstract': \"    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vitamin D is critical in many physiologic and pathophysiologic processes including inflammatory status, immune function, and cardiovascular health. Vitamin D deficiency is widespread among HIV-infected adults and children. This is particularly alarming since there is a higher risk than the general population for complications like osteoporosis, non-AIDS-defining malignancies, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) - all diseases associated with vitamin D deficiency. It is not known how much vitamin D deficiency heightens the risk of complications like CVD, affects immune function and disease progression, or interferes with optimal treatment in the HIV population. The impact of vitamin D deficiency in the HIV population may be compounded even further since the etiology of HIV-related complications like CVD is thought to be related in part to inflammation and detrimental endothelial effects associated with chronic HIV infection-similar proposed mechanisms as vitamin D deficiency. Data suggest that optimal vitamin D status may be protective against these HIV-related complications, and optimizing vitamin D status with oral supplementation in HIV-infected individuals may improve the risk of HIV-related complications by decreasing inflammation and/or improving endothelial dysfunction, and may improve immune function even in individuals on antiretroviral therapy. Developing suitable repletion strategies is crucial to maximizing health status, particularly in HIV-infected children and young adults, where an opportunity exists for disease prevention. However, the best method of vitamin D repletion is not known, and data suggest that some antiretroviral medications interfere with vitamin D metabolism. Thus, we hypothesize that (1) optimizing vitamin D status to the current Institute of Medicine's (IOM) suggested 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration of e20 ng/mL improves CVD risk, inflammation, and CD4 cell counts in HIV-infected individuals, (2) increasing 25(OH)D concentrations to >30 ng/mL improves CVD risk and inflammation to a greater degree than increasing eto 20 ng/mL (the concentration some experts consider optimal for cardiovascular health), and (3) a 'high dose' of oral vitamin D is necessary to achieve 25(OH)D concentrations >30 ng/mL. These hypotheses will be addressed by determining the longitudinal relationships between serum 25(OH)D concentrations, carotid intima-media thickness, pulse wave velocity, pro-inflammatory biomarkers, and CD4 cell counts in HIV-infected children and young adults in a double-blinded, randomized-controlled trial of three different vitamin D dosing regimens given over 24 months in HIV-infected children and young adults (ages 10-25 years) with vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D <20 ng/mL). We will also evaluate the 25(OH)D concentrations from each arm after 6, 12, and 24 months of supplementation, in order to determine a dose-response relationship. These findings could have a sizable impact on health in this population, since vitamin D therapy is inexpensive and associated with few adverse side effects.

Total body fat will be ascertained by Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry to examine the confounding effects of adiposity on outcome measures. Innovative aspects of this proposal include (1) characterizing the temporal changes in vascular health and cardiometabolic risk outcomes in response to enhancement of vitamin D status in a population of children at high-risk for vascular dysfunction and cardiometabolic risks; and (2) delineating the vitamin D effects on inflammatory markers and adipokines relevant to CVD risk. Establishing the protective benefits of vitamin D would have major public health importance, since optimization of vitamin D status would be an inexpensive primary prevention strategy for improving cardiometabolic health during childhood and for reducing CVD risk during adulthood.

       "  'text': 'Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Friedberg, Jonathan, W\\nABSTRACT\\nIn addition to the primary effects on calcium homeostasis, Vitamin D has important effects on both\\ninnate and adaptive immunity in humans. However, the degree to which these pleotropic effects of\\nVitamin D influences specific immune responses to infections and cancer in humans is not known.\\nIndolent B-cell lymphoma represents a unique model system to define the effect of Vitamin D on the\\nimmune response to cancer. Gene expression profiling studies demonstrate the importance of\\nimmune-based signatures in the lymph node microenvironment on prognosis in follicular lymphoma. A\\nrecently published study identified that immune-infiltration measured by PD-L2 expression in the\\nmicroenvironment of follicular lymphoma is strongly predictive of outcome, where low immune\\ninfiltration was associated with increased risk of early relapse after initial therapy and ultimately\\nincreased risk of death. As Vitamin D can upregulate tissue-specific PD-L1 and PD-L2 surface\\nglycoprotein expression in humans as a direct transcriptional inducer through the Vitamin D receptor,\\nVitamin D may directly influence the immune response to malignancy. Our current R01 (CA214890)\\nfunds a phase 3 clinical trial termed ILyAD (Indolent Lymphoma And Vitamin D), which randomizes\\npatients being treated with rituximab to Vitamin D supplementation with oral cholecalciferol 2000IU\\ndaily, or placebo daily. At baseline and in follow-up, all patients have blood obtained for Vitamin D\\nlevels, shipped to URMC labs on day of blood draw for central batched analysis using the gold standard\\nliquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS) method. Therefore, we have the unprecedented\\nopportunity to discover the direct relationship of Vitamin D treatment to immunomodulation in the setting\\nof indolent lymphoma. In this supplement, we propose to assess the tumor biopsies of patients in\\nILyAD to assess immune infiltration, and correlate to baseline Vitamin D level. To evaluate specific cell\\npopulations of interest, we will further characterize the immune infiltration patterns observed in tumors\\nfrom patients with low and high Vitamin D levels using spatial genomics. Leveraging the power of our\\nrandomized, prospective trial, we will determine if Vitamin D supplementation can overcome the\\nnegative prognosis of low immune infiltration on the trial. These assays therefore incorporate a\\npotential biomarker of response to Vitamin D, and providing important mechanistic insights around\\nVitamin D with implications in other benign and malignant immune-reactive conditions.\\nOMB No. 0925-0001/0002 (Rev. 03/2020 Approved Through 02/28/2023) Page 1 Continuation Format Page',\n",

       "  'text': 'PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Abundant preclinical and epidemiologic data suggest that vitamin D possesses anti-neoplastic activity, and that individuals with higher plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels have lower risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) and improved survival from CRC. Despite compelling evidence implicating vitamin D in CRC, critical questions remain about whether these findings reflect a true causal relationship, and what the biological mech- anisms of vitamin D activity are. Our central hypothesis is that vitamin D supplementation to achieve sufficient levels of 25(OH)D leads to improved survival in CRC patients and influences several neoplastic pathways that can be exploited as biomarkers of efficacy and targets for novel treatment strategies. We will test this hypothe- sis within two novel randomized clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation: a) a phase II double-blind random- ized trial of high- versus low-dose vitamin D3 in combination with chemotherapy in patients with metastatic CRC, and b) a randomized trial of preoperative high-dose vitamin D3 versus placebo in patients with resectable colon cancer for examination of vitamin D biology in fresh human tumor tissue. We will also lever- age a rich prospective cohort of metastatic CRC patients enrolled in a completed NCI-sponsored phase III trial of chemotherapy (CALGB/SWOG 80405) to further define and validate biomarkers of vitamin D action. In Aim 1, we will determine the impact of supplemental vitamin D on survival of CRC patients, test distinct hypotheses about the vitamin D dose-response relationship, and explore biomarkers of vitamin D status, response, and efficacy. We will investigate whether circulating levels of vitamin D binding protein and tumoral expression of vitamin D receptor, 1α-hydroxylase, and 24-hydroxylase are associated with improved survival within our ran- domized trials, and whether these markers modify the relationship between vitamin D and patient outcome. In Aim 2, we will conduct a precision medicine analysis of vitamin D to elucidate the mechanistic basis for its anti- tumor activity in CRC. We will explore the impact of vitamin D supplementation on tumoral markers of inflam- mation, lymphocytic infiltrates, and inflammatory gene signatures in surgical colectomy specimens from pa- tients treated with high-dose preoperative vitamin D3 versus placebo. We will also perform next generation se- quencing and Nanostring analysis of tumors from CRC patients with high- versus low vitamin D status to identi- fy unique genetic and transcriptional signatures associated with vitamin D-mediated carcinogenesis. In sum- mary, this translational proposal leverages innovative randomized trials of vitamin D to take the next critical steps in understanding vitamin D activity and biology in CRC. Our findings will confirm causality, provide new insights into biomarkers of vitamin D activity, and lead to potential inclusion of vitamin D into standard therapy – including immunotherapy – with the ultimate goal of improving the survival of patients with CRC.',\n",

Our central hypothesis is that vitamin D supplementation to achieve sufficient levels of 25(OH)D leads to improved survival in CRC patients and influences several neoplastic pathways that can be exploited as biomarkers of efficacy and targets for novel treatment strategies. We will test this hypothe- sis within two novel randomized clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation: a) a phase II double-blind random- ized trial of high- versus low-dose vitamin D3 in combination with chemotherapy in patients with metastatic CRC, and b) a randomized trial of preoperative high-dose vitamin D3 versus placebo in patients with resectable colon cancer for examination of vitamin D biology in fresh human tumor tissue.

However, the degree to which these pleotropic effects of\\nVitamin D influences specific immune responses to infections and cancer in humans is not known.\\nIndolent B-cell lymphoma represents a unique model system to define the effect of Vitamin D on the\\nimmune response to cancer. Gene expression profiling studies demonstrate the importance of\\nimmune-based signatures in the lymph node microenvironment on prognosis in follicular lymphoma. A\\nrecently published study identified that immune-infiltration measured by PD-L2 expression in the\\nmicroenvironment of follicular lymphoma is strongly predictive of outcome, where low immune\\ninfiltration was associated with increased risk of early relapse after initial therapy and ultimately\\nincreased risk of death. As Vitamin D can upregulate tissue-specific PD-L1 and PD-L2 surface\\nglycoprotein expression in humans as a direct transcriptional inducer through the Vitamin D receptor,\\nVitamin D may directly influence the immune response to malignancy. Our current R01 (CA214890)\\nfunds a phase 3 clinical trial termed ILyAD (Indolent Lymphoma And Vitamin D), which randomizes\\npatients being treated with rituximab to Vitamin D supplementation with oral cholecalciferol 2000IU\\ndaily, or placebo daily. At baseline and in follow-up, all patients have blood obtained for Vitamin D\\nlevels, shipped to URMC labs on day of blood draw for central batched analysis using the gold standard\\nliquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS) method. Therefore, we have the unprecedented\\nopportunity to discover the direct relationship of Vitamin D treatment to immunomodulation in the setting\\nof indolent lymphoma. In this supplement, we propose to assess the tumor biopsies of patients in\\nILyAD to assess immune infiltration, and correlate to baseline Vitamin D level. To evaluate specific cell\\npopulations of interest, we will further characterize the immune infiltration patterns observed in tumors\\nfrom patients with low and high Vitamin D levels using spatial genomics. Leveraging the power of our\\nrandomized, prospective trial, we will determine if Vitamin D supplementation can overcome the\\nnegative prognosis of low immune infiltration on the trial. These assays therefore incorporate a\\npotential biomarker of response to Vitamin D, and providing important mechanistic insights around\\nVitamin D with implications in other benign and malignant immune-reactive conditions.\\nOMB No. 0925-0001/0002 (Rev. 03/2020 Approved Through 02/28/2023) Page 1 Continuation Format Page', 'title': 'Vitamin D and Follicular Lymphoma'}\n"
